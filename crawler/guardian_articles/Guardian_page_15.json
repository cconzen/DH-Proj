                    "body": "Good morning. Ukraine\u2019s government has suggested Kyiv could expand its own war aims with an intensifying counteroffensive against Russia\u2019s forces, and said it would suspend the flow of Russian gas through its country to Europe. With the war now in its 11th week and Russia pounding the vital port of Odesa with missile strikes in an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said late last night that the military was gradually pushing Russian troops away from the key city of Kharkiv and back towards the border with Russia. The Ukrainian military\u2019s general staff said its forces drove the Russians out of four villages to the north-east of Kharkiv, a key city that has been under attack from the Russians since the beginning of the conflict. Meanwhile, trapped and wounded Azovstal soldiers are pleading for rescue.  In what way might they expand? Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, seemed to indicate that the country could go beyond merely pushing Russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the 24 February invasion and mean \u201cthe liberation of the rest of our territories\u201d. What else is happening? Here\u2019s what we know on day 77 of the invasion.  Pro-choice states rush to pledge legal shield for out-of-state abortions  After the bombshell leak of a supreme court draft opinion last week revealed that the majority of justices plan to overturn Roe v Wade, a handful of states have been reaffirming and expanding their abortion care. In recent days, a flurry of bills and statements have been emerging in largely Democratic-run states as lawmakers and organizations scramble to prepare for the possibility of a post-Roe America. As some states seek to become \u201csafe havens\u201d for out-of-state abortion seekers, other states have been increasing abortion funding, expanding provider access and offering legal protections from lawsuits launched by citizen \u201cbounty-hunters\u201d against those involved in abortions. Only 38% of women of reproductive age live in states that have shown support for abortion rights, according to the research organization Guttmacher Institute. In contrast, 58% live in states that have demonstrated hostility towards abortion rights. Only 4% of women live in middle-ground states.  Last month, the New York state senator Liz Krueger introduced a bill that would shield New York doctors who offer abortion services to out-of-state patients.  Al Jazeera accuses Israeli forces of killing journalist in West Bank  Al Jazeera has accused Israel of deliberately killing one of its reporters during a firefight between Israeli security forces and Palestinian gunmen in the occupied West Bank town of Jenin. Shireen Abu Akleh, 51, a Palestinian American and one of the Arab world\u2019s most well-known reporters who had covered the conflict for decades, was shot in the head this morning and taken to hospital in critical condition. She had been covering a military raid in a northern town and nearby refugee camp, a historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abu Akleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked as \u201cpress\u201d. The Qatar-based television network said her colleagues at the scene said the veteran reporter was shot by Israeli forces. In a statement, Al Jazeera called on the international community to hold Israeli forces accountable for their \u201cintentional targeting and killing\u201d of Abu Akleh. \u201cIn a blatant murder, violating international laws and norms, the Israeli occupation forces assassinated in cold blood Al Jazeera\u2019s correspondent in Palestine,\u201d it said.  What has the Israeli military said? A statement said its troops had shot back after coming under \u201cmassive fire\u201d in Jenin and that \u201cthere is a possibility, now being looked into, that reporters were hit \u2013 possibly by shots fired by Palestinian gunmen\u201d.  In other news \u2026   As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the US, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a \u201churricane gun\u201d would constitute an act of war. Survivors of the brutal regime of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos have described his son\u2019s apparent landslide presidential election victory as the product of trickery, warning that it is unlikely the billions stolen by his family will be recovered, and that human rights in the country will be weakened. The lifting of zero-Covid policies in China would see a \u201ctsunami\u201d of infections and almost 1.6 million deaths, a study claims, citing in part China\u2019s low vaccination rate of elderly people. China\u2019s government remains committed to a zero-Covid policy, enforcing lockdowns, strict quarantine and isolation. Vicky White spent 16 years developing a reputation as a model deputy in the sheriff\u2019s office that operates the jail in Lauderdale county, Alabama, according to her boss. Authorities now say that makes it harder to come to grips with how she became the lover of a murder suspect incarcerated at her lockup.  Stat of the day: California water use leaps 19% in March,  one of the driest months on record  California\u2019s drought is worsening yet new figures show that in March, water usage jumped nearly 19% compared with 2020, one of the driest months on record. The startling figures come despite pleas from the authorities who have urged residents to curb their water usage. They also come the same day that the Los Angeles mayor ordered residents and businesses to restrict outdoor watering to just two days a week in an effort to conserve. Don\u2019t miss this: Finding it hard to get a new job? Robot recruiters might be to blame  There is a phenomenon in recruiting that is baffling experts: while there are record-level job openings in both the UK and in the US, why do many people still have to apply to sometimes hundreds of jobs, while many companies complain they can\u2019t find the right talent? Some experts argue that algorithms and artificial intelligence now used extensively in hiring are playing a role. \u2026 Or this: \u2018Republican and more Republican\u2019: Idaho shifts ever rightward  Idaho has long been one of the most conservative states in America with its fair share of extremism. Now, critics warn, the extremists are being normalised. Once dismissed as backwoods fanatics, the far right has entered the political arena and identified a path to power. That path leads through a state Republican party that has long exploited tensions between independent-spirited Idahoans and the federal government and more recently embraced Donald Trump\u2019s culture of grievance. Climate check: Vanuatu\u2019s push for legal protection from climate change wins crucial support  Vanuatu\u2019s push for the international court of justice (ICJ) to protect vulnerable nations from climate change has received the backing of 1,500 civil society organisations from more than 130 countries, as it heads toward a crucial vote at the UN general assembly later this year. If it succeeds, the ICJ\u2019s advisory opinion \u2013 although non-binding \u2013 carries legal weight and moral authority which experts say could help shape international law. Last Thing: Ordure! Ordure! Canadian MP sorry for logging on to session from toilet stall  A Canadian lawmaker has apologized after he was caught logging on to a parliamentary session from a toilet stall. The Liberal party member Shafqat Ali participated in the hybrid session of parliament, joining a Zoom-like feed. But members grew suspicious. \u201cThe member of parliament was literally using the washroom while participating in a sitting of the House of Commons, the cathedral of Canadian democracy,\u201d the Conservative House leader, John Brassard, said.

                    "body": "Manchester City\u2019s victory over West Ham in the semi-final meant that they were heading for Wembley for a fourth FA Cup final in the last six seasons. The match against Chelsea was a repeat of March\u2019s League Cup final which City won 3-1. Whichever team triumphed would be winning a double, after Chelsea secured the Women\u2019s Super League title last weekend. A victory for Emma Hayes\u2019 side would also mean that following 2020-21\u2019s Treble, Chelsea would have won five of the six domestic trophies on offer over the past two seasons. The two sides have developed a strong rivalry in recent years, with Chelsea\u2019s dominance only punctured by City\u2019s success in the cup competitions.       Fans, merchandise and a police horse on a rainy Wembley Way    Presenter Joelah Noble interviews Kimberly Wyatt, who is a former Pussycat Doll and is taking part in the half-time show      Wembley starts to fill up with Chelsea and Manchester City fans     Fans and players sing the national anthem (above); City\u2019s Georgia Stanway and Chelsea\u2019s Sophie Ingle in action.   After a blistering start by City, with Caroline Weir going close on a couple of occasions, Chelsea steadied the ship and the game developed into a cagey one with both teams playing cautiously, desperate not to concede the first goal. Sam Kerr did breach the City defence in the 18th minute (below) when she raced through and finished with aplomb, but her effort was chalked off for offside.    Kerr found the net again 15 minutes later, when she headed home Millie Bright\u2019s looping cross. This time the goal stood, and Chelsea had the lead.    Differing emotions in the stands following Kerr\u2019s goal, while her teammates celebrate (below).   Manchester City equalised just before half-time courtesy of a wonderful curling effort by Lauren Hemp, seen below surging past Chelsea defender Millie Bright.  Chelsea\u2019s lead was restored shortly after the hour mark when Erin Cuthbert\u2019s piledriver of a shot from outside the area flew past Manchester City keeper Ellie Roeback, going in off the underside of the bar.   Manchester City stepped up the pressure in the search for an equaliser and in the 89th minute, Hayley Raso chested down a long ball, held off the challenge of Magdalena Eriksson and poked the ball home, sending raptures of delight through the City fans as the game went to extra time.   City carried that momentum into the first half of extra-time and went close on a number of occasions \u2013 but the pendulum swings again in the 99th minute. City\u2019s Alanna Kennedy misjudged a bouncing ball just inside the Chelsea half, which allowed Sam Kerr time and space to break forward. From just inside the City area, the Australian hits a shot that takes a big deflection off the stretching Alex Greenwood, wrong-footing Roebuck and putting Chelsea in front for a third time.       City search in vain for another equaliser but time is against them, and the final whistle sparks scenes of joy among Chelsea players and fans.             The victory over City was Chelsea\u2019s fourth FA Cup triumph, all of them under Hayes and it takes her trophy haul with the club up to 13. \u201cThat was so amazing for the women\u2019s game today,\u201d she said afterwards. \u201cI love playing Manchester City \u2013 it is football of the highest level. Tactically both teams have their strengths. I thought we were really bold and for that reason, that\u2019s why were on the winning team.\u2019  \u2022 Click here to catch up on our series of picture essays on the road from Willenhall to Wembley"

                    "body": "A new 184-bed private hospital is about to open in London, the second-largest in the capital, where patients will enjoy views of Buckingham Palace and will be treated by doctors understood to be paid up to \u00a3350,000 a year. It provides a stark contrast with the NHS, which is buckling under the strain of record waiting lists, backlogs for cancer care and routine operations and a resurgence of Covid cases that is putting pressure on wards and staffing. The opening of the Ohio-based Cleveland Clinic\u2019s first London hospital at the end of this month comes at a time when the private health sector is booming. With 29 intensive care unit beds and eight operating theatres staffed by 1,200 people, the eight-storey site \u2013 estimated by analysts to have cost \u00a31bn \u2013 will add to concerns about the emergence of a two-tier healthcare system.  Among London\u2019s 19 private hospitals, it will be second biggest after the Wellington hospital in St John\u2019s Wood, which is run by the US company HCA. Specialising in neurology, cardiology, orthopaedics and digestive care, the new hospital boasts a neurosurgical operating theatre twice the usual size, with an MRI scanner in the room beside it \u2013 allowing the surgeon to wheel a patient over during an operation to check whether a brain tumour or other abnormalities have been completely removed. In most other hospitals, more surgery is required when further abnormalities are discovered in the weeks after an operation. The NHS National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Bloomsbury, central London, and other NHS hospitals around the country, for example in Sheffield and Nottingham, also have an intraoperative MRI setup.  Unlike other British hospitals, Cleveland Clinic London has a pharmacy robot that laser-cuts strips of tablets into single doses and adds a barcode. These are then administered to patients via automated dispensing cabinets, with the aim of reducing errors and wastage. About 270 consultants will be working at the new site, the vast majority of whom also work for the NHS, and will typically spend one to two days a week at the clinic. The company has reportedly offered most of them fixed salaries of up to \u00a3350,000 a year, rather than the fee-per-service basis common in the private sector, triggering a recruitment war. Generally, the private sector\u2019s fees for \u201crain makers\u201d \u2013 top-level consultants \u2013 resemble \u201cfootball-level salaries\u201d, according to Ted Townsend, an analyst at the London-based consultancy LaingBuisson. Some earn up to \u00a3500,000 a year from a combination of private and NHS pay, clinical excellence awards and professorships, he said. The new hospital will also employ 450 nurses, with more than half coming from other private operators or from Cleveland Clinic\u2019s hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Cleveland, with the rest having moved over from the NHS, which employs 300,000 overall and is facing nursing staff shortages. The company\u2019s chief executive, Tom Mihaljevic, who flew over from Ohio for the unveiling of the new hospital, joked that it would not charge extra for its rooms with a view of Buckingham Palace. He said: \u201cWe take care of very complex and sick patients. People come to Cleveland Clinic when they run out of hope.\u201d While targeting UK patients with private health insurance or the growing number of people who are paying for treatment themselves, along with overseas patients, the Cleveland Clinic London is also in talks about providing complex procedures for NHS patients to help reduce waiting lists. Brian Donley, an orthopaedic surgeon who is now chief executive of the clinic, said: \u201cWe are in those discussions with all different parts of London, with different NHS trusts on how we can support [reducing] that backlog. We do expect to see some NHS patients, in particular around complex care, in particular around diagnostics.\u201d A spokesperson said these would mainly be tests for heart disease. A number of London NHS trusts have come to rely more on the private sector during the pandemic. HCA, which has six London hospitals, provided an unprecedented amount of cancer care, cardiology and other services to several NHS trusts in the capital last year. David Rowland, the director of the thinktank Centre for Health and the Public Interest, said: \u201cThe worry is the two-tier health system. London has always been the centre of the private hospital market. An estimated \u00a31bn investment in a single hospital is a sign of how strongly foreign investors are betting against the NHS being able to meet the future health needs of the population. And the government seems entirely relaxed about this shift.\u201d Rowland added that \u201cthe pulling away of NHS consultants and nurses is problematic. Private companies are paying significantly more.\u201d He pointed to ophthalmology, where growing numbers of consultants are leaving NHS jobs to join large private companies.  Cleveland Clinic is partly banking on the return to London of overseas patients \u2013 known as \u201cembassy patients\u201d as foreign embassies often pay for their treatment. They have been slow to come back since the pandemic, but travel restrictions to the UK have now been relaxed by Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar \u2013 all leading sources of private patients. The US group, which has 22 hospitals and 226 outpatient centres globally, was founded in 1921 as a non-profit group and has no shareholders, which means profits are ploughed back into the business, in a similar way to the British health companies Bupa and Nuffield Health. The private sector has been criticised for using consultants and nurses that have been trained by the NHS, paid for by the UK taxpayer. Cleveland Clinic is trying to address this and has partnerships to train 150 student nurses, and to host neurology PhD students in its hospital. It will also let junior NHS doctors work there to gain expertise, its chief commercial officer, Will Rowberry, said. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2022. An earlier version incorrectly said the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Bloomsbury was the only NHS hospital with an intraoperative MRI setup."

If you\u2019d like to get in touch, you can find me here.\n\nThe latest death toll from Monday\u2019s catastrophic earthquake stands at 8,364. On Wednesday morning, AFP reported that Syria\u2019s toll had climbed to 2,470. At least 5,894 have died in Turkey, bringing the overall lives lost in both countries so far to 7,926. The numbers are expected to increase \u201csignificantly\u201d, Syria\u2019s White Helmets said.\nMore than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan declared a disaster zone in the 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.\nTurkey\u2019s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. Turkey\u2019s ministry of transport and infrastructure said that overnight 3,400 people took shelter in trains being used as emergency accommodation.\nTurkey has deployed more than 24,400 search and rescue personnel to the quake area. The number of personnel was expected to rise, disaster management agency official Orhan Tatar said.\nThree British nationals are missing after the earthquake, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary said on Tuesday. \u201cWe assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low,\u201d James Cleverly said.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.21am GMT\n\n\n 4.56am  \n\nThis account of the earthquake from Syria, relayed to my colleague Mostafa Rachwani by Mohamad Kazmooz, is worth reading in full. Here is how it begins: \n\nFor the past two days, I have lived what has felt like an impossible nightmare.\nAt 4am on Monday, at our home in Idlib in north-west Syria, we were violently shaken awake by an extremely powerful earthquake.\nIt was a terror unlike any that I can describe, our home was shaking, our belongings were being tossed to the ground, screens were falling and shattering, pieces of the walls and chunks of the building collapsed.\nIn that moment, I did not think we would survive. I live with my wife and parents, and we were all violently woken up by this nightmare.\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.42am  \n\nChina\u2019s earthquake rescue team, which has arrived in Turkey, is comprised of 82 members, brought 20 tonnes of medical and other rescue supplies and equipment, as well as four search-and-rescue dogs, according to CCTV.\nThe team will cooperate with the local government, the embassy in Turkey, the United Nations and other agencies on missions, including setting up a temporary command, carrying out personnel search and rescue and providing medical aid, CCTV said.\nSeparately, civil society rescue teams with at least 52 members from several provinces in China including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Guangdong are heading to the earthquake-stricken areas in Turkey to carry out the rescue work, CCTV reported.\nChina has already committed to give a first tranche of 40 million yuan ($5.9 million) in emergency aid to Turkey.\n\n\n\n 4.16am  \n\nThese satellite images released by Maxar Technologies give an idea of the scale of the challenge for emergency crews over the coming days. They show in vivid detail the breadth of the destruction that has unfolded in towns, cities and villages across the region: \n\n\n\n\n 3.58am  \n\nA woman named Nurgul Atay told the Associated Press she could hear her mother\u2019s voice beneath the rubble of a collapsed building in the Turkish city of Antakya, the capital of Hatay province. But rescuers did not have the heavy equipment needed to rescue her.\n\u201cIf only we could lift the concrete slab, we\u2019d be able to reach her,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother is 70 years old, she won\u2019t be able to withstand this for long.\u201d\nHealth Minister Fahrettin Koca said 1,647 people were killed in Hatay alone, the highest toll of any Turkish province. At least 1,846 people had been rescued there as of Tuesday evening, he said. Hatay\u2019s airport was closed after the quake destroyed the runway, complicating rescue efforts.\n\n\n\n 3.43am  \n\nHere is a video of a man who appears to be part of a rescue crew offering a hard-working rescue dog some of his water, then freshening up his fur:\n\n\nUpdated at 3.56am GMT\n\n\n 3.36am  \n\n\u201cPeople revolted (on Tuesday) morning. The police had to intervene,\u201d a man named Celal Deniz, 61, told AFP in Gaziantep. His brother and nephews remain trapped under rubble.\n\u201cWhere have all our taxes gone, collected since 1999?\u201d\nHe was referring to a levy dubbed \u201cthe earthquake tax\u201d that was implemented after a massive earthquake destroyed large parts of northwestern Turkey and killed 17,400 people,\nThe revenues \u2013 now estimated to be worth 88bn liras, or $4.6bn \u2013 were meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services.\nBut how this money was actually spent is not publicly known.\nIf there aren\u2019t enough rescuers, volunteers say they will have to step in and do the hard work themselves.\n\n\n\n 3.14am  \n\nHere is another scene reported by AFP, showing people\u2019s anger at how long it has taken rescue teams to arrive:\n\nWith every passing moment, Ebru Firat knows the chances dim of finding her cousin alive under the rubble of a flattened building in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep.\nAnd with that fading hope, the 23-year-old\u2019s grief is being replaced by rage at the government\u2019s earthquake response.\n\u201cI have no more tears left to cry,\u201d she said.\nDespite the importance of every minute, no rescue team arrived at the scene in the critical first 12 hours after the disaster, forcing victims\u2019 relatives and local police to clear the ruins by hand, witnesses said.\nAnd when the rescuers finally came on Monday evening, they only worked for a few hours before breaking for the night, residents told AFP.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.24am GMT\n\n\n 3.04am  \nSyria death toll passes 2,000\n\nSyria\u2019s White Helmets say that the death toll in rebel-held northwest Syria now stands at 1,220, from 1,000 a few hours ago.\nWith the 812 people confirmed dead in government-held areas, this brings the total known toll in Syria to 2032.\nAt least 5,894 have died in Turkey, bringing the overall lives lost in both countries so far to 7,926.\nThe numbers are expected to increase \u201csignificantly\u201d, the White Helmets said.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.15am GMT\n\n\n 2.47am  \n\nOn Wednesday, Dave O\u2019Neill, leader of a British emergency service rescue team, told AFP that the coming hours will be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d in the scramble through the quake debris.\n\u201cThat is why we are so keen to get to work as fast as we can to make the most of the rescue window in front of us,\u201d he said shortly after the 77-person British squad arrived at Gaziantep airport.\nThe team just wanted to \u201cget out as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have search teams and dogs. We need to get out there and establish our base and link up with the other teams.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 2.48am GMT\n\n\n 2.32am  \n\nAFP has this report from Gaziantep\u2019s airport, which has turned into a place for people to sleep amid a flurry of arrivals of rescuers from Turkey and around the world. \nTurkey\u2019s Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has warned the next 48 hours would be \u201ccrucial\u201d in the hunt for survivors, with temperatures barely above freezing.\nWith survivors scared to return to their homes after the devastating 7.8 magnitude tremor, the airport has become a refuge for many.\nAbout 100 people wrapped in blankets slept in one lounge of the terminal normally used to welcome Turkish politicians and celebrities.\nLocal authorities have banned people from staying in apartment blocks because of the many aftershocks hitting the region.\nMustafa Ehianci, a 20-year-old student, was among those huddled in the airport\u2019s VIP lounge, with five other members of his family.\nHe said he had been asleep when the first tremor hit on Monday.\n\u201cIt was like a bad dream, a roller coaster,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cWe were waiting outside when the second quake struck a few hours later. Now we are all terrified,\u201d Ehianci told AFP.\n\u201cWe are sleeping here, eating here. We are safe in this area, there is electricity and sewage.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when we will leave.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.05am  \n\nAn earthquake rescue team dispatched by China\u2019s government arrived in Turkey\u2019s Adana Airport early on Wednesday, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Wednesday.\nThe team, comprised of 82 members, brought 20 tonnes of medical and other rescue supplies and equipment, as well as four search-and-rescue dogs, according to CCTV.\n\nThe team will cooperate with the local government, the embassy in Turkey, the United Nations and other agencies on missions, including setting up a temporary command, carrying out personnel search and rescue and providing medical aid, CCTV said.\n\n\n\n 1.56am  \n\nA lot of bleak news today, so it\u2019s worth taking a moment to watch this video made by Mexico\u2019s rescue envoy of its four-legged team members: \n\n\n\n\n 1.45am  \n\nThe United States has announced that it was sending two rescue teams to NATO ally Turkey. Allen said the teams would arrive Wednesday morning and head to the city of Adiyaman, where search efforts have so far been limited.\nThe teams, coming on two C-130 transport aircraft, are bringing 158 personnel, 12 dogs and 170,000 pounds (77,100 kilograms) of specialized equipment, he said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on right now in Turkey is getting those teams out and saving lives, to put it bluntly,\u201d Allen said from Ankara.\n\u201cIf they need further assistance when it comes to populations who may be without housing or need immediate assistance, we are certainly ready to provide that,\u201d he said.\nThe 7.8-magnitude earthquake has killed more than 7,100 people in the two countries, according to officials and medics.\n\n\n\n 1.31am  \n\nMore now on how the US is approaching aid to Syria, given its refusal to normalise relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or offer any direct reconstruction aid, seeking accountability for abuses during the brutal nearly 12-year civil war.\nAssad has wrested back most of the country and over the past year has been restoring relations with other Arab nations as well as Turkey.\nStephen Allen, who is leading the response on the ground for the US Agency for International Development, said that most of the damage was in areas not under Assad\u2019s control and that USAID had local partners there.\nUSAID is reorienting assistance that was already in place to help war-hit Syrians, instead focusing on rescue efforts and other immediate needs including providing shelter and food, Allen said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the full gamut of humanitarian response going in northwest Syria right now,\u201d Allen told reporters.\nHe declined to name the non-governmental groups working with the United States, citing operational security.\n\n\n\n 1.07am  \nUS says it is helping Syria but not Assad\n\nThe United States said Tuesday it was working with partners to provide earthquake relief in Syria but would stand firm against working with the Damascus government, AFP reports.\nThe United States also said it expected to send further assistance to Turkey after sending two rescue teams to the NATO ally, which suffered heavily as well in Sunday\u2019s earthquake.\n\u201cIn Syria itself we have US-funded humanitarian partners that are coordinating lifesaving assistance,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters as he met his Austrian counterpart.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing that assistance to help people in Syria recover from this disaster, just as we have been their leading humanitarian donor since the start of the war in Syria itself,\u201d Blinken said.\n\u201cI want to emphasize here that these funds, of course, go to the Syrian people -- not to the regime. That won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 1.07am GMT\n\n\n 12.44am  \n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent condolences to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday, citing the North\u2019s state media.\n\n\n\n 12.29am  \n\nThis aerial video from Reuters gives an idea of the scale of destruction in Hatay, Turkey, with entire multi-storey buildings lying collapsed in the roads. \n\n\n\n\n 12.26am  \n\nOn Tuesday in the town of Jinderis, in the opposition-held zone on the Syrian province of Idlib, a toddler was pulled alive from the wreckage of a collapsed building. Video from the White Helmets, the emergency service in the region, shows a rescuer digging through crushed concrete amid twisted metal until the little girl, named Nour, appeared. The girl, still half buried, looks up dazedly as they tell her, \u201cDad is here, don\u2019t be scared. \u2026 Talk to your dad, talk.\u201d\nA rescuer cradled her head in his hands and tenderly wiped dust from around her eyes before she was pulled out.\nThe quake has wreaked new devastation in the opposition-held zone, centered on the Syrian province of Idlib, which was already been battered by years of war and strained by the influx of displaced people from the country\u2019s civil war, which began in 2011.\nMonday\u2019s earthquake killed hundreds across the area, and the toll was continually mounting with hundreds believed still lost under the rubble. The quake completely or partially toppled more than 730 buildings and damaged thousands more in the territory, according to the White Helmets, as the area\u2019s civil defense is known.\n\n\n\n 11.43pm  \n\nThe Economist has spoken to Ovgun Ahmet Ercan, an earthquake expert, who estimates that \u201c180,000 people or more may be trapped under the rubble, nearly all of them dead.\u201d\nThe Guardian has not independently verified this figure. The UN said yesterday that it feared the toll could reach 20,000, a staggering number and much lower than this estimate.\nThe Turkish provinces impacted by the quake are home to 13 million people.\nFor comparison, almost 230,000 people died in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. \n17,000 died in the 1999 earthquake in Turkey. \n\n\nUpdated at 11.47pm GMT\n\n\n 11.37pm  \n\nReuters has this short story of a single Hatay street almost totally levelled by the earthquakes: \n\nStreet no. 21 in Hatay, Turkey was, on Sunday, a happy home for dozens of families.\nBy Monday, there was hardly anything left of it.\nHardly a building was left standing. Doors, roofs and windows lay scattered. Injured people were pulled out of the remains of what once were homes. Many people stood in silence, staring in disbelief.\n\u201cWords are sticking in my throat. Crying is no longer a remedy,\u201d said Halil Gencoglu on Tuesday, fighting back tears.\nAbdulkadir Dogan had already lost his parents in the earthquake and was still hoping to find his cousin alive.\n\u201cWe want to rescue our wives, relatives and friends who are stuck. They are our priority because we are trying to cling to life with them... My cousin is stranded there and I am here and I can do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n 11.19pm  \n\nA short while ago, a two-year-old girl and her mother were rescued after 44 hours trapped under rubble in Hatay, Turkey. \nThis is a very brave Vafe Sabha: \n\n\n\n\n 11.06pm  \n\nHi, my name is Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest from Turkey and Syria for the next few hours.\nIf you have questions, news you think we may have missed or just want to get in touch, you\u2019ll find me on Twitter here.\n\nUpdated at 11.06pm GMT\n\n\n 10.57pm  \nA summary of today's developments\n\n\nThe latest death toll from Monday\u2019s catastrophic earthquake has passed 7,800. In Turkey, 5,894 people are confirmed to have been killed, while 1,932 people have died in Syria for a combined total of 7,826 fatalities.\nAs the scale of the devastation from the 7.8 magnitude tremor continued to unfold, the World Health Organization warned the number of casualties could exceed 20,000. Initial rescue efforts were stalled by a second quake on Monday that measured 7.7 magnitude. Adelheid Marschang, a WHO senior emergency officer, has said about 23 million people, including 1.4 million children, are likely to be affected by the quake.\nMore than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres.\nTuesday afternoon, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan declared a disaster zone for the 10 provinces affected by the devastating earthquakes in southern Turkey, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.\nTurkey\u2019s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. Turkey\u2019s ministry of transport and infrastructure said that overnight 3,400 people took shelter in trains being used as emergency accommodation.\nTurkey has deployed more than 24,400 search and rescue personnel to the quake area. The number of personnel was expected to rise with the arrival of additional people, disaster management agency official Orhan Tatar said.\nThree British nationals are missing following the earthquake that struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary said on Tuesday. \u201cWe assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low,\u201d James Cleverly said.\nA plane carrying 77 UK search and rescue specialists, state-of-the-art equipment and four search dogs has landed in Gaziantep in south-east Turkey, the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said. The team, made up of firefighters and staff from 14 fire and rescue services from across the country, will cut their way into buildings and help locate survivors in the rubble of the earthquakes.\nAt least 20 people have escaped from a jail holding members of Islamic State (IS) in north-west Syria in the aftermath of yesterday\u2019s earthquakes, according to local media and Agence France-Presse. The military police prison in the town of Rajo, near the Turkish border, was damaged in the quakes and aftershocks, a source at the facility said, leading to a riot and escapes.\nAid from Turkey to north-west Syria has temporarily stopped due to the fallout of the devastating earthquake, a UN spokesperson said on Tuesday, leaving aid workers grappling with the problem of how to help people in a country fractured by war.\nSyria was accused of playing politics with aid after the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam Sabbagh, said his country should be responsible for the delivery of all aid into Syria, including those areas not under Syrian government control. The dispute over the control of the aid is hampering efforts into northern Syria, which is held by rebel groups. The government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing.\nThe UN\u2019s cultural agency Unesco said on Tuesday it was ready to provide assistance after two sites listed on its world heritage list in Syria and Turkey sustained damage in the devastating earthquake. As well as the damage to the old city of Syria\u2019s Aleppo and the fortress in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbak\u0131r, Unesco said at least three other world heritage sites could be affected.\n\n\n\n\n 10.15pm  \n\nA newborn baby girl has been pulled alive from the rubble of a home in northern Syria, after relatives found her still tied by her umbilical cord to her mother, who died in Monday\u2019s massive earthquake.\nThe infant is the sole survivor of her immediate family, the rest of whom were all killed when the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Syria and neighbouring Turkey flattened the family home in the rebel-held town of Jindayris, said relative Khalil al-Suwadi.\n\u201cWe heard a voice while we were digging,\u201d Suwadi told AFP on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord (intact) so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 9.56pm  \nDeath toll passes 7,800\n\nThe latest death toll from Monday\u2019s catastrophic earthquake has passed 7,800.\nIn Turkey, 5,894 people are confirmed to have been killed, while 1,932 people have died in Syria for a combined total of 7,826 fatalities. There are fears that the toll will rise inexorably, with World Health Organization officials estimating up to 20,000 may have died.\n\n\n\n 9.48pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.45pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.44pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.09pm  \n\nIraq\u2019s autonomous Kurdistan region has said it has resumed oil exports through Turkey, after suspending them as a precaution following Monday\u2019s deadly earthquake.\n\u201cAt 9:45 pm (1845 GMT) the Kurdistan region\u2019s oil exports resumed via the pipeline connecting the area with Turkey,\u201d the Kurdish ministry of natural resources said in a statement.\nThe northern region usually exports around 450,000 barrels of oil a day through Turkey, and has continued to pump oil out of the country despite the federal authorities demanding a halt to the trade.\n\n\n\n 8.21pm  \n\nOn one side of Syria\u2019s civil war, a man in army fatigues carried a lifeless child\u2019s ashen body from the rubble of a shattered building in the government-held city of Hama.\nAcross a frontline on another side of Syria, a rescue worker in the white helmet and black-yellow vest of the Syrian civil defence carried a young girl - shaken but alive - from the rubble of her home in rebel-held Azaz.\nBoth witnessed by Reuters journalists, the scenes that unfolded in the hours after an earthquake devastated Syria and Turkey on Monday were similar, though the uniforms clearly located the rescuers on opposing sides of the conflict that has splintered the country.\n\u201cThe earthquake shook opposition held and regime-held areas, and I support the Syrian revolution with all my heart, but I care for my people,\u201d Ramadan Suleiman, 28, said by phone, expressing sympathy for civilians living in government areas.\n\u201cI\u2019m a human, they\u2019re human, we felt for those in Turkey and feel the same when it happens in other places like Europe. That\u2019s humanity,\u201d said Suleiman, who was displaced to Idlib from Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria during the war.\n\u201cThis is the last thing that the country needed. It\u2019s a country that is inhabited by death,\u201d said Hassan Hussein, from the coastal city and government stronghold of Tartous.\n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nThree British nationals remain missing following the earthquake. Foreign secretary James Cleverley said the department\u2019s Crisis Response Hub is working to support at least 35 Britons caught up in the disaster.\nHe added: \u201cWe assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low.\u201d\nA number of relief organisations have urged the public to dig deep and donate, saying the help they are able to provide over the next few days \u201cwill save lives\u201d.\nJames Denselow, UK head of conflict and humanitarian advocacy for Save the Children UK, told the PA news agency: \u201cThe scale of this earthquake, in terms of not just strength but the kind of actual absolute sprawl of it has meant that we\u2019ve had to spend a lot of time in this first phase checking in on needs, checking in on what is working logistically, checking that all our people are OK.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve got airports out of action, hospitals collapsed, clinics collapsed, all the sort of places we would normally use are not necessarily accessible.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.52pm  \n\nTwo US Agency for International Development teams will arrive Wednesday morning in Turkey and will head to the southeastern province of Adiyaman to focus on urban search and rescue following earthquakes that killed more than 6,300 people and left a trail of destruction in Turkey and neighboring Syria.\nUSAID\u2019s disaster assistance response team leader for the earthquake response, Stephen Allen, told reporters on Tuesday the teams will be about 80 people each and also bring 12 dogs and 170,000 pounds of specialised tools and equipment, including for triage and concrete breaking, Reuters reports.\nThe U.S. military aircraft carrying the teams and equipment were to land at Incirlik Air Base in the southern Turkish province of Adana and deploy immediately to hard-hit urban centers to save as many people as possible, Allen said.\n\u201cThey really do work 24/7, they work in shifts, they go around the clock, because every hour does count in the first few days,\u201d Allen said.\n\nUpdated at 8.54pm GMT\n\n\n 7.38pm  \n\nThe UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, \u201cpledged the UK\u2019s steadfast support\u201d to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan during a phone call following a devastating earthquake affecting the Turkish president\u2019s country and neighbouring Syria, No 10 said.\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u201cPrime minister, Rishi Sunak, spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan this afternoon, following the devastating earthquakes which struck Turkiye (Turkey) and Syria.\n\u201cHe expressed his deep condolences for the tragic loss of life and pledged the UK\u2019s steadfast support.\n\u201cThe prime minister confirmed that a 77-strong British search and rescue team arrived in Gaziantep today with specialist equipment and dogs, in response to a request from the Turkish government, and will immediately start work assisting with the rescue effort.\n\u201cPresident Erdogan thanked the prime minister for the UK\u2019s solidarity in response to this tragedy and welcomed international search and rescue and medical support for the initial emergency response.\n\u201cThe prime minister also noted the deeply concerning humanitarian situation over the border in north-west Syria, where Turkiye plays an important co-ordinating role, and set out how the UK has increased support to aid organisations and emergency responders.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.31pm GMT\n\n\n 7.16pm  \n\nGerman chancellor, Olaf Scholz, promised Turkish president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan further comprehensive support in dealing with the earthquake disaster, a spokesman for the German government said after the two leaders spoke on the phone.\n\nUpdated at 8.31pm GMT\n\n\n 6.59pm  \nEarthquake death toll surpasses 7,200\n\nThe number of people who have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to 7,266.\nIt comes after the Turkish health minister confirmed 5,434 people were killed in the country alone. \n\n\n\n 6.53pm  \n\n\nOn the edge of G\u00f6ksun, empty buildings with their walls ripped open showed the power of the earthquake that devastated the town just a day earlier. Icicles dangled from cracked walls, where the force of the quake had torn homes open to reveal their contents, exposing the tiles and chairs that used to be a kitchen and now were left open to the freezing air. Elsewhere, whole houses had been turned to rubble.\n\nOn Tuesday G\u00f6ksun was a ghost town, just over 70 miles from the centre of the deadly earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people in Turkey and Syria and has left untold numbers trapped under the rubble.\nMost residents of G\u00f6ksun had fled in the aftermath, as powerful aftershocks continued to shake their homes. Those who stayed were struggling to survive in temperatures that dropped well below zero, sheltering in their cars or around makeshift campfires and struggling to find water and food, fearing further tremors.\n\n\n\n\n 6.40pm  \n\nKing Charles has told President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that his \u201cthoughts and special prayers\u201d are with all those affected by the earthquakes in Turkey.\nHe said: \u201cMy wife and I have been most shocked and profoundly saddened by the news of the devastating earthquakes in South East Turkiye (Turkey).\n\nI can only begin to imagine the scale of suffering and loss as a result of these dreadful tragedies and I particularly wanted to convey our deepest and most heartfelt sympathy to the families of all those who have lost their loved ones.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and special prayers are with everyone who has been affected by this appalling natural disaster, whether through injury or the destruction of their property, and also with the emergency services and those assisting in the rescue efforts.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 7.17pm GMT\n\n\n 6.29pm  \n\nA plane carrying 77 UK search and rescue specialists, state-of-the-art equipment and four search dogs has landed in Gaziantep in south-east Turkey, the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said.\nThe team, made up of firefighters and staff from 14 fire and rescue services from across the country, will cut their way into buildings and help locate survivors in the rubble of the earthquakes.\nTheir specialist equipment includes seismic listening devices, concrete cutting and breaking equipment and propping and shoring tools.\nAn emergency medical team was also on the flight and will conduct a full assessment of the situation on the ground, according to the FCDO.\n\n\n\n 6.23pm  \n\nAftershocks, freezing temperatures and damaged roads are hampering efforts to tackle the enormous humanitarian emergency triggered by Monday\u2019s 7.8-magnitude earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria, which has now killed more than 6,200 people and left 380,000 others seeking refuge in Turkey alone, writes Ruth Michaelson and Sam Jones.\nAs the scale of the devastation from the initial quake \u2013 and a second, 7.7-magnitude tremor \u2013 became clearer, the Turkish authorities declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces and the World Health Organization warned that the number of fatalities could exceed 20,000.\nBy Tuesday evening, the death toll in Turkey and Syria had passed 6,200. Turkey\u2019s emergency management agency said more than 4,500 people had died and around 26,000 had been injured.\nThe death toll in government-held areas of Syria climbed past 800, with some 1,400 injured, according to the health ministry. In the rebel-held northwest of Syria, the White Helmets emergency rescue organisation said at least 900 people had died and more than 2,300 had been hurt.\n\n\n\n\n 6.14pm  \n\nThe ancient citadel of Aleppo suffered further damage in the earthquake that ravaged southern Turkey and northern Syria, a local architect and the Syrian antiquities directorate said.\nOn Tuesday a pile of rubble near the citadel was all that was left of a structure identified by local architect Mohammed al-Rifaei as the \u201csheep tower\u201d, which he said had stood there until the devastating early morning quake.\n\u201cWe had repeatedly asked for the restoration of the tower, but now it needs to be rebuilt from scratch,\u201d Rifaei said.\nSyria\u2019s Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums said parts of the citadel had suffered minor to moderate damage.\nParts of an Ottoman-era mill had collapsed, walls had cracked and some of the dome of a mosque\u2019s minaret had fallen off, Reuters reports.\nThe citadel, listed by the UN cultural agency Unesco as a world heritage site, was significantly damaged in a long-running battle between government and rebel forces before it reopened in 2018.\n\nUpdated at 7.21pm GMT\n\n\n 5.52pm  \n\nSyrian foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, has asked European countries to send aid following the earthquake, saying that sanctions are no excuse not to, he told Lebanon\u2019s Al Mayadeen TV on Tuesday.\nSyrian officials have long argued that western sanctions have harmed reconstruction efforts in areas where the 12-year conflict has subsided, Reuters reports.\nThe US and European nations have said that sanctions aim to pressure the Syrian government into a political process that could end the conflict.\n\nUpdated at 7.22pm GMT\n\n\n 5.29pm  \n\nA 20-year-old student survived the earthquake in Turkey after posting a video to social media from underneath the rubble.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.29pm GMT\n\n\n 5.12pm  \nDeath toll in earthquake reaches 6,000\n\nThe death toll has reached 6,000 with the search for survivors ongoing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nUpdated at 5.13pm GMT\n\n\n 4.58pm  \n\nThe Turkish defence ministry says the fire at Iskenderun Port on the Mediterranean Sea has been extinguished, Reuters reports.\nAfter the earthquake struck on Monday, images and videos showed burning containers and thick black smoke rising overhead.\n\nUpdated at 5.03pm GMT\n\n\n 4.55pm  \n\nHere are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Syria and Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.35pm  \n\nAuthorities in Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus have confirmed that reports of a group of high school students being rescued from the rubble of a hotel in the southeastern city of Adiyaman are incorrect.\n\u201cI have just spoken to the mother of one of them and can confirm that neither her child nor any other has been found,\u201d Sener Elcil, former head of the breakaway state\u2019s teachers union told the Guardian. Members of a school volleyball team, the students were in the city to compete in a tournament when the devastating earthquake struck.\n\u201cWhile some educators and the parents who were with them managed to escape the hotel, the children were trapped and no one has so far been pulled out of the building,\u201d he said.\nSener, who headed the union until last year and is helping coordinate rescue efforts with the school, said other groups of Turkish Cypriot school children were also in Turkey when the 7.8- magnitude quake hit \u201cwhich explains the confusion.\u201d The territory, which has only been recognised by Ankara since declaring independence in 1983, has strong ties with Turkey.\n\u201cOne of the groups [also staying in Adiyaman] managed to come back but is not the volleyball group,\u201d he added. \u201cToday we sent [mobile phone] power banks and coats to the teachers and parents who got out of the hotel because the temperatures are freezing and they had no way of communicating with us. They have stayed on because they want to help in the rescue efforts.\u201d\nTurkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tartar, who has had oversight of the rescue efforts, has reportedly dispatched a 100-strong rescue team to the hotel and has vowed to follow up with new missions daily in a bid to help overstretched rescue operations currently underway.\nThe island\u2019s outgoing president Nicos Anastasiades tweeted today that Cyprus was ready to \u201ccontribute and offer our assistance to the humanitarian, rescue and recovery efforts.\u201d Foreign ministry officials said the offer had been rebuffed by Turkey. In the wake of the 1974 Turkish invasion, following a right-wing coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece, Ankara has refused to extend diplomatic recognition to Cyprus.\nWe have removed a previous post which said that the 24 junior Turkish Cypriot high school students were found because it was later found to be incorrect.\n\nUpdated at 4.53pm GMT\n\n\n 4.25pm  \n\nReuters reports that Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi spoke with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call to offer condolences and support after the deadly earthquake, Egypt\u2019s presidency said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n 4.15pm  \nSummary of the day so far \u2026\n\nIt is quarter past 7pm in Ankara and Damascus. Here is a summary of the latest situation in Turkey and Syria after yesterday\u2019s earthquake and aftershocks.\n\nAftershocks, freezing temperatures and damaged roads are hampering efforts to reach and rescue those affected by Monday\u2019s earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria, which has killed more than 5,000 people and destroyed thousands of buildings.\nAs the scale of the devastation from the 7.8 magnitude tremor continued to unfold, the World Health Organization warned the number of casualties could exceed 20,000. Initial rescue efforts were stalled by a second quake on Monday that measured 7.7 magnitude. Adelheid Marschang, a WHO senior emergency officer, has said about 23 million people, including 1.4 million children, are likely to be affected by the quake.\nThe number of confirmed deaths in both Turkey and Syria now stands at 5,261, with the expectation that numbers will continue to rise, according to Reuters. The death toll in the rebel-held north-west of Syria has been raised to 900.\nMore than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres.\nTuesday afternoon, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan declared a disaster zone for the 10 provinces affected by the devastating earthquakes in southern Turkey, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.\nTurkey\u2019s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. Turkey\u2019s ministry of transport and infrastructure said that overnight 3,400 people took shelter in trains being used as emergency accommodation.\nTurkey has deployed more than 24,400 search and rescue personnel to the quake area. The number of personnel was expected to rise with the arrival of additional people, disaster management agency official Orhan Tatar said.\nThree British nationals are missing following the earthquake that struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary said on Tuesday. \u201cWe assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low,\u201d James Cleverly said.\nAt least 20 people have escaped from a jail holding members of Islamic State (IS) in north-west Syria in the aftermath of yesterday\u2019s earthquakes, according to local media and Agence France-Presse. The military police prison in the town of Rajo, near the Turkish border, was damaged in the quakes and aftershocks, a source at the facility said, leading to a riot and escapes.\nAid from Turkey to north-west Syria has temporarily stopped due to the fallout of the devastating earthquake, a UN spokesperson said on Tuesday, leaving aid workers grappling with the problem of how to help people in a country fractured by war.\nSyria was accused of playing politics with aid after the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam Sabbagh, said his country should be responsible for the delivery of all aid into Syria, including those areas not under Syrian government control. The dispute over the control of the aid is hampering efforts into northern Syria, which is held by rebel groups. The government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing.\nThe UN\u2019s cultural agency Unesco said on Tuesday it was ready to provide assistance after two sites listed on its world heritage list in Syria and Turkey sustained damage in the devastating earthquake. As well as the damage to the old city of Syria\u2019s Aleppo and the fortress in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbak\u0131r, Unesco said at least three other world heritage sites could be affected.\nA fire at the port of \u0130skenderun on the Mediterranean Sea continues for the second day. Television images showed thick black smoke rising from burning containers which had toppled when the quake struck on Monday.\nPolice in Turkey said on Tuesday they had detained four people over \u201cprovocative\u201d social media posts. The four individuals were detained after officers found accounts that shared \u201cprovocative posts aiming to create fear and panic\u201d, the police said.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.04pm GMT\n\n\n 3.57pm  \n\nThe UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said his government was working to send support to those affected by the \u201cincredibly tragic situation\u201d in Turkey and Syria \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d.\nSunak said:\n\nIt\u2019s obviously an incredibly tragic situation that we\u2019re all seeing in Turkey and Syria. I want everyone to know that we are doing what we can to provide support, we are in touch with the authorities in both Syria and Turkey.\n\nThe foreign secretary, James Cleverly, told MPs he had already authorised the deployment of a medical assessment team to respond to the earthquake, adding:\n\nThe further stages of requirement will evolve over time, we will of course work closely with our international partners to make sure we address that.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.04pm GMT\n\n\n 3.48pm  \n\nVideos and photographs of the two earthquakes that have devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, killing at least 5,000 people, show rescuers digging with their hands, apartment blocks collapsing to the ground in seconds, and the shaking apart of a castle that had stood for almost two millennia.\nBut few images depict the agony quite as plainly as a photograph from the Turkish region of Kahramanmara\u015f, in which a father holds the hand of his dead teenage daughter as rescuers and civilians pick through the flattened building where she died on Monday.\n\nRead more here:\n\n\nUpdated at 3.55pm GMT\n\n\n 3.31pm  \n\nBJ Richardson, 45, a US citizen who works as a teacher in Gaziantep, near the epicentre of the earthquake in Turkey, tells Jedidajah Otte his experience of the situation unfolding on the ground.\nWe are all in shock. I walked through a small area of Gaziantep on Tuesday morning. Damage is everywhere \u2013 cracked buildings, plaster, broken glass, some buildings have fallen. Each of these buildings represents hundreds of people who are now homeless.\nI saw dozens of cars with people or even whole families sleeping in them. Temperatures were freezing last night, below 30F [-1C]. Their batteries, their gas, it will not last.\nI\u2019m American and have been living and teaching in Gaziantep for the past seven years.\nI woke up at 4.17am when the first earthquake hit. We do get occasional earthquakes but this one was clearly many orders of magnitude worse. And it just did not stop.\nI live on the third floor of an old five-storey concrete building, and I was expecting it to collapse. My windows were shoved open, and I could hear glass shattering in the hall as people came running out of their apartments and outside, pretty much as soon as they could, which was not the wisest thing to do, but \u2013 you panic.\nRead more here:\n\n\n\n\n 3.19pm  \n\nAid from Turkey to north-west Syria has temporarily stopped due to the fallout of the devastating earthquake, a UN spokesperson said on Tuesday, leaving aid workers grappling with the problem of how to help people in a country fractured by war.\nThe cross-border aid operation overseen by the UN since 2014 has been crucial to Syrians who fled President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule during the conflict, bypassing the territory he controls.\nNow, however, there is no clear picture of when the aid, on which some 4 million people depend, would resume, Madevi Sun-Suon, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA), told Reuters.\nSun-Suon said:\n\nSome roads are broken, some are inaccessible. There are logistical issues that need to be worked through. We are exploring all avenues to reach people in need.\n\nOne avenue includes delivering aid via government-held territory, a process involving crossing frontlines through which aid has seldom passed during the war. Damascus has long opposed the humanitarian operation that has delivered aid into Syria from Turkey, saying assistance should be delivered via Damascus.\n\nUpdated at 3.22pm GMT\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nHere are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Syria and Turkey.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.24pm GMT\n\n\n 2.34pm  \n\nReuters has a quick snap to say that the death toll in the rebel-held north-west of Syria has been raised to 900.\nEarlier today it was given as 790, with a warning that it would \u201cdramatically\u201d rise.\nThe total death toll in both Turkey and Syria now stands at 5,261, with the expectation that numbers will continue to rise.\n\nUpdated at 2.45pm GMT\n\n\n 2.17pm  \n\nAt least 20 people have escaped from a jail holding members of Islamic State (IS) in north-west Syria in the aftermath of yesterday\u2019s earthquakes, according to local media and Agence France-Presse.The military police prison in the town of Rajo, near the Turkish border, was damaged in the quakes and aftershocks, a source at the facility said, leading to a riot and escapes. The jail, run by Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters, houses about 2,000 inmates. About 1,300 are suspected IS fighters, and most of the rest of the population are suspected to be members of the US-backed Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). All 20 who escaped were believed to be IS, the source told AFP.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said it could not verify whether prisoners had escaped, but confirmed there was a mutiny in which guards lost control of parts of the prison.Most suspected members of IS captured in Syria are held in facilities under the oversight of Kurdish forces in Syria\u2019s north-east, which was not as badly affected by Monday\u2019s deadly earthquake and aftershocks. There have been a number of attempted outbreaks in the past, but most have been unsuccessful.The group lost control of the last slivers of its territory across Syria and Iraq in 2019 after a five-year US-led fight to destroy the jihadists\u2019 \u201ccaliphate\u201d. Cells affiliated to IS have continued to operate since in both countries.\n\nUpdated at 2.37pm GMT\n\n\n 2.14pm  \nAt least 8,000 people rescued from debris in Turkey with 380,000 taking refuge in shelters\n\nMore than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres.\nAssociated Press reports that many people have posted to social media to plead for assistance for loved ones believed to be trapped under rubble, with Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency quoting interior ministry officials as saying that all calls were being \u201ccollected meticulously\u201d and the information relayed to search teams.\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said 13 million people among the country\u2019s population of 85 million were affected in some way. He has declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces in order to manage the response. Turkey said it would only allow vehicles carrying aid to enter the worst-hit provinces of Kahramanmara\u015f, Ad\u0131yaman and Hatay in order to speed the effort.\nTurkey has large numbers of troops in the border region with Syria and has tasked the military to aid in the rescue efforts, including setting up tents for the homeless and a field hospital in Hatay province. The defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said a humanitarian aid brigade based in Ankara and eight military search and rescue teams had also been deployed.\n\nUpdated at 3.57pm GMT\n\n\n 1.52pm  \n\nUK for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has launched an urgent appeal in response to earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.\nIn a press release it said that in Syria the organisation was already distributing emergency supplies, such as high-thermal blankets, mattresses and other lifesaving items, and was working to mobilise additional supplies for the region.\nEmma Cherniavsky, chief executive of UK for UNHCR, said: \u201cThousands of people\u2019s lives were devastated in one night when the first of these terrible earthquakes struck. Many families who had previously fled from conflict in Syria were already struggling to cope with the cold winter, and now are facing this new crisis.\n\u201cUNHCR is already working to help people affected by these earthquakes and assessing what more needs to be done. Every donation will help us to deliver essential aid to the people affected.\u201d\nThe appeal can be found here.\n\nUpdated at 2.04pm GMT\n\n\n 1.43pm  \n\nHere are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Syria and Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.21pm  \n\nQatar has been preparing a shipment of aid at Al Udeid airbase. The country said it would send 120 rescue workers to Turkey, alongside \u201ca field hospital, relief aid, tents and winter supplies.\u201d\n\nEarlier, during a televised address Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan thanked Qatar for offering 10,000 container homes for people left homeless.\n\n\n\n 1.19pm  \n\nThe southern Turkish port of Iskenderun has suffered severe structural damage due to an earthquake, with all operations halted until further notice, the container shipping firm AP Moller Maersk said on Tuesday.\nReuters reports that Maersk said in an advisory that it was not yet clear when the port would return to normal operations.\n\u201cGiven the situation at Iskenderun, we will need to perform a change of destination for all bookings bound for the port or already on the water,\u201d it said.\n\u201cWe are currently planning to divert containers to nearby hubs within operational feasibility or hold at transshipment ports \u2013 including the Port of Mersin [in Turkey] and Port Said [in Egypt].\u201d\n\nA fire has been burning in the post since yesterday, when containers that had been dislodged by the quake broke into flames.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.38pm GMT\n\n\n 1.14pm  \n\nAndrew Lee, professor of public health at the University of Sheffield, has commented on the complexity involved in mounting search and rescue operations, saying: \u201cEarthquake disasters are complex emergencies, with widespread impacts on society, infrastructure, local economies, health, education and other sectors.\n\u201cThe full scale of the disaster will not be clear for a few days yet, and the total number of casualties will probably increase. The risk of further aftershocks remains, and damaged buildings pose a further hazard.\n\u201cThe consequences are not just short term but are also longer term, such as through mental health effects (eg post-traumatic stress disorder) and the need for rehabilitation for those disabled by earthquake related injuries. The recovery from such disasters often takes many months and years afterwards.\u201d\nLee makes an important additional point: \u201cWhat we see in the media is only a small snapshot, and we usually won\u2019t see affected populations and areas away from the major urban centres that media teams don\u2019t get to.\u201d\nIt will be particularly challenging to report from the north-west of Syria for example, and the World Health Organization has today again warned that it is concerned about the regions where little news has filtered back through.\n\nUpdated at 1.37pm GMT\n\n\n 1.04pm  \nThousands of children may be among dead \u2013 Unicef\n\nIn Geneva, Unicef spokesperson James Elder has told reporters: \u201cThe earthquakes \u2026 may have killed thousands of children.\u201d\nWhile verified numbers were not yet available, Reuters reports he said \u201cwe know that scores of schools, hospitals and other medical and educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed by the quakes, vastly impacting children\u201d.\nCalling the quake the most powerful to hit the region in almost 100 years, Elder said Syrian refugees in northwest Syrian and in Turkey were among the most vulnerable.\nThe World Health Organisation had earlier warned that the total casualty figures could exceed 20,000. A quake of a similar magnitude in the region in 1999 killed at least 17,000 people.\n\n\n\n 12.47pm  \n\nThree British nationals are missing following the earthquake  that struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary has said.\nMaking a statement in the House of Commons in London, James Cleverly said: \u201cAs of this morning, we know that three British nationals are missing and the Foreign Office\u2019s Crisis Response Hub is working to support the at least 35 British nationals who have been directly affected by these earthquakes.\n\u201cWe assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 12.59pm GMT\n\n\n 12.46pm  \n\nArmenia\u2019s foreign minister says his country has offered to help Syria and Turkey in their response to the deadly quake, despite difficult relations between Yerevan and Ankara.\nAssociated Press reports Ararat Mirzoyan told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that Armenia is prepared to send aid and rescue teams to both countries, but did not immediately say whether the offers had been accepted.\nMirzoyan recalled that Armenia experienced a devastating earthquake in 1988 and required international assistance at the time.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.00pm GMT\n\n\n 12.24pm  \n\nReuters reports that Turkish authorities say about 13.5 million people have been affected by the quake.\nIt says the impact has been felt in an area spanning roughly 450 km (280 miles) from Adana in the west to Diyarbak\u0131r in the east, and 300 km (185 miles) from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

It\u2019s been coordinated very professionally by the Turkish authorities. They will be leaving imminently.\n\u201cAnd of course, they will be landing in daylight. And that is the time when they can be most effective. One of the things we learned from the Haiti earthquake over 10 years ago now was the importance of coordination and everyone not just rushing in.\n\u201cIt will land in daylight today, I hope, later this morning, and it will immediately hit the ground running.

While it has been more than a century since an earthquake caused such devastation on this fault, there have been a number of smaller quakes in the last 25 years, and the region has been considered at serious risk of something worse.\nThere have been higher magnitude earthquakes than this one even in recent years around the world, but that is not a sufficient measure of impact on its own: crucial to the devastation here was the location of the earthquake near large population centres, and how close to the surface of the Earth it hit.\nA deep earthquake takes place between 300km and 700km down. This one was very shallow \u2013 about 17km below the surface \u2013 meaning that it was felt more powerfully and across a wider region above ground.\nThat impact was magnified by a 7.5-magnitude aftershock \u2013 on a different faultline 100km away, and much larger relative to the initial quake than aftershocks typically are. Earthquake magnitude is measured on a logarithmic scale, meaning that this aftershock only released about a third of the energy of the first even though the figures are close \u2013 but in hitting buildings already severely damaged by the initial quake, it greatly amplified the original damage, and put many rescue workers at risk.\nRead more here: Why the Turkey and Syria earthquake was a catastrophe\n\n\nUpdated at 7.31am GMT\n\n\n 6.55am  \n\nThat\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, on this saddest of days. My colleague Martin Belam will be with you for the next few hours. \n\n\n\n 6.49am  \nSummary\n\nIt is almost 9am in Hatay, Turkey. If you\u2019re just joining us, here is where things stand following the massive earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.\n\nInternational rescue missions have rushed to Turkey and Syria after one of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the region in at least a century left more than 4,800 people dead, thousands injured and an unknown number trapped in the rubble. The early-morning quake and dozens of aftershocks brought down entire apartment blocks in Turkey and heaped more destruction on Syrian communities already devastated by over a decade of war.\nAt least 3,381 people were confirmed dead in Turkey, according to the Anadolu news organisation, which cited the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority. With the death toll coming from Syria, the most recent figure for which is 1,444, that brings the total toll to 4,825. The WHO has warned the number of dead could rise to more than four times this figure, or about 20,000, in the coming days.\nThe first quake struck as people slept and measured magnitude 7.8, making it one of the most powerful in the region in at least a century. It was felt as far away as Cyprus and Cairo. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said preliminary data showed the second large quake measured 7.7 magnitude and was centred 67km (42 miles) north-east of Kahramanmara\u015f, Turkey, at a depth of 2km.\nMore than 7,800 people have been rescued across 10 provinces, according to Orhan Tatar, an official with Turkey\u2019s disaster management authority.\nAs of 6am, early 13,000 rescue workers, many of them volunteers, had left Istanbul to help in impacted areas, according to the news organisation Sabah, which cites the governor of Istanbul. Many are bound for Hatay, where, according to reports, there is growing anger at the lack of assistance for people trapped under the rubble.\nSyrian opposition said \u2018hundreds of families\u2019 are still trapped under rubble. Time is running out to save hundreds of families still trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings after this week\u2019s devastating earthquake, the head of the Syrian opposition-run civil defence service said on Tuesday.\nIn 1999, when a quake of similar magnitude hit the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, it killed more than 17,000 people.\nThe death toll could rise to more than 20,000 people, said Catherine Smallwood, the World Health Organization\u2019s senior emergency officer for Europe. \u201cThere\u2019s continued potential of further collapses to happen so we do often see in the order of eightfold increases on the initial numbers,\u201d she told AFP, speaking when the estimated toll stood at 2,600. \u201cWe always see the same thing with earthquakes, unfortunately, which is that the initial reports of the numbers of people who have died or who have been injured will increase quite significantly in the week that follows.\u201d\nJoe Biden spoke with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, on Monday to offer condolences and reaffirm Washington\u2019s readiness to assist in rescue efforts, the White House said. The US president \u201cnoted that US teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items\u201d, said a White House statement.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.56am GMT\n\n\n 6.43am  \nDeath toll in Turkey rises to 3,381\n\nThe death toll from Monday\u2019s earthquakes in Turkey has risen by 460 in the last few hours from 2,921 to 3,381, according to the Anadolu news organisation, which cites the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority.\nWith the highest death toll coming from Syria, the most recent figure for which is 1,444, that brings the total toll to 4,825.\nThe WHO has warned the number of dead could rise to more than four times this figure, or about 20,000, in the coming days.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.49am GMT\n\n\n 6.36am  \n\nCivilians across remote towns in southern Turkey have described how relief efforts were stretched to breaking point, amid destruction stretched over a border region spanning almost 650 miles. In rebel-held northern Syria, volunteer rescue workers said they lacked some of the most basic fuel and other provisions required to pull those still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\nAli \u00dcnl\u00fc, from the remote town of Ad\u0131yaman, close to the quake epicentre in Kahramanmara\u015f, said that he had been working to free his elderly mother who was trapped under the rubble of her home since the earthquake levelled buildings in the town early on Monday morning.\n\u201cAfter the earthquake I ran to my mother\u2019s house, and saw the building had collapsed. I was devastated. I started waiting for rescue teams, but they didn\u2019t show up. I started calling officials, all the lines cut out. I gave my name and a record of the incident, but the officials said everyone is waiting. Since I called thens, no one has showed up,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe weather is extremely cold, and we have no food. At first, one of my relatives texted that he is under the rubble and we could hear his voice under the debris. He was very close, I could hear him. He was trapped there for four hours, and eventually we dug him out. We also saved two or three others, but these are the ones that were living on higher floors. My mother, however, lived on the first floor. Eventually we had to stop as it was raining and there is a danger of the buildings collapsing further.

You can get in touch with me directly on Twitter here if you see news you think we may have missed.\nThe death toll from the two quakes has risen to more than 4,300 according to government figures. At least 2,921 have been confirmed dead in Turkey, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said, and 1,444 in Syria, according to figures from the Damascus Government and rescue workers. Thousands more are injured, and the death toll is expected to rise.\nIn 1999, when a tremor of similar magnitude hit the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, it killed more than 17,000. The WHO warned that the toll from Monday\u2019s earthquakes could pass 20,000.\nHere is what we know so far:\n\nThe first quake struck as people slept, and measured magnitude 7.8, one of the most powerful quakes in the region in at least a century. It was felt as far away as Cyprus and Cairo. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said preliminary data showed the second large quake measured 7.7 magnitude, and was 67km (42 miles) north-east of Kahramanmara\u015f, Turkey, at a depth of 2km.\nIn 1999, when a tremor of similar magnitude hit the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, it killed more than 17,000.\nThe death toll could rise to over 20,000, the World Health Organization\u2019s senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said. \u201cThere\u2019s continued potential of further collapses to happen so we do often see in the order of eight fold increases on the initial numbers,\u201d she told AFP, speaking when the estimated toll stood at 2,600. \u201cWe always see the same thing with earthquakes, unfortunately, which is that the initial reports of the numbers of people who have died or who have been injured will increase quite significantly in the week that follows,\u201d Smallwood added.\nUS President Joe Biden spoke with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday to offer condolences and reaffirm Washington\u2019s readiness to assist in rescue efforts, the White House said. Biden \u201cnoted that US teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\nSyria\u2019s envoy to the UN said Monday that aid sent after the earthquake will reach all its population, even though Damascus does not control all of its territory. Asked if aid donated to Syria \u2013 some areas are held by rebels \u2013 would reach all of the population, Syria\u2019s UN envoy Bassam Sabbagh said it would. \u201cWe assure the UN that we are ready to help and to coordinate to provide assistance to all Syrians in all territory of Syria,\u201d Sabbagh said after meeting with UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to convey a Syrian government request for aid. \u201cWe are ready to help also those who wanted to provide the help in all Syria,\u201d he stressed.\nMore than 10 search and rescue teams from the European Union have been mobilised to help with the recovery, a spokesperson for the European Commission said. The US, UK, Canada, Israel, Russia and China are among other nations to have offered assistance and calls have emerged for the international community to relax some of the political restrictions on aid entering north-west Syria, the country\u2019s last rebel-held enclave and one of the areas worst hit by the earthquake.\nPrisoners mutinied in a northwestern Syria prison Monday after the earthquake, with at least 20 escaping the jail holding mostly Islamic State group members, a source at the facility told AFP.\nThere have been more than a 100 smaller aftershocks registered by seismologists.\nTurkey\u2019s armed forces have set up an air corridor to enable search and rescue teams to reach the zone affected.\nTurkey\u2019s Akkuyu nuclear power plant, which is under construction, was not damaged by the earthquake, an official from the Russian company building the plant said.\nThe Swedish presidency of the European Union has activated the integrated political crisis response (IPCR) to coordinate EU support measures in response to the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, the EU Council said in a statement. The IPCR arrangements strengthen the EU\u2019s ability to take rapid decisions when facing major cross-sectoral crises requiring a response at the EU level.\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for increased funding for humanitarian aid in Syria, saying that many people in the north-west of the country have already been displaced up to 20 times, and that medical care in the region was \u201cstrained beyond capacity, even before this tragedy\u201d.\nThe partial destruction of a Roman-era castle in the Turkish city of Gaziantep has led to fears that two earthquakes that struck on Monday may have damaged other priceless monuments in Turkey and Syria, areas rich in cultural heritage.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.13am GMT\n"

                    "body": "At the end of what had been a largely flawless visit to Europe, during which he focused on the misery Vladimir Putin was imposing on Russia, Joe Biden closed his 27-minute speech on Saturday evening in Warsaw by conjuring up the image of a less popular US president \u2013 George W Bush \u2013 when he said: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201d The US president has previously called Putin a killer, a pure thug, a war criminal and a butcher, but he had never advocated regime change, risking turning the war for the defence of Ukraine to a familiar one of American aggression. Biden can fairly say it was a personal expression of loathing, but during his election campaign he often said how much the words of an American president mattered and needed to be weighed. He would not be a Twitter loudmouth like the man he would later unseat, Donald Trump. It was clear from the way White House aides initially avoided any comment to the media that the final ad-libbed line had not been expected and needed clarification. It was not the first time that his off-script remarks have required official reworking. The press aides scrambled to undo the damage, interpreting Biden\u2019s words not as a statement of intent, let alone presaging a plan of action, but instead a personal expression of moral revulsion. Later an official explained: \u201cThe president\u2019s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. He was not discussing Putin\u2019s power in Russia or regime change.\u201d But his remarks in their raw form hardly sat well with the UK government briefing on Saturday night that sanctions could be lifted if and when Putin left Ukraine. The British message was hardly that it would be business as usual \u2013 after all, Boris Johnson has said Putin must fail and be seen to fail \u2013 but the UK strategy set a potential end point to the sanctions. Biden\u2019s remarks added another dimension.  At the end of a month marked by a clear single war aim \u2013 the defence of the territorial integrity of Ukraine \u2013 the position had suddenly been blurred. It was a badly needed gift to Moscow, which has hardly had a stellar information war. Skilled at playing Washington as the imperialist bully, Moscow was quick to claim that Russians \u2013 not American leaders \u2013 chose their president. The remarks also leave the many mediators in this crisis \u2013 Turkey, Qatar and China \u2013 facing a harder task in convincing Putin there is any merit in turning back now. It is all or nothing. The US president has burned his bridges with Russia and there is no point in any negotiation, Moscow will argue, whether it believes this or not. Richard Haass, the chair of the Council on Foreign Relations, said: \u201cThe president just expanded US war aims, calling for regime change. However desirable it may be, it is not within our power to accomplish. Plus [it] runs [the] risk it will increase Putin\u2019s inclination to see this as a fight to the finish, raising odds he will reject compromise, escalate, or both. \u201cHis remarks made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous. That is obvious. Less obvious is how to undo the damage, but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts and make clear that the US [is] prepared to deal with this Russian government. \u201cIt discourages Putin from any compromise, essentially: if you\u2019ve got everything to lose, it frees him up. Why should he show any restraint? And it confirms his worst fears, which is that this is what the United States seeks. His ouster and systemic change.\u201d What may be more worrying, especially if this war becomes prolonged, is the impact on the many powerful bystanders in this conflict. Western diplomacy pulled off a coup in March when Russia was left with only Eritrea, Belarus, North Korea and Syria coming to its side in a vote at the UN general assembly when 141 countries voted to condemn the invasion. But that left 35 countries, including powerful players such as India and China, not willing to condemn Russia at least through their vote. By no means all of the 141 countries have imposed sanctions, giving Roman Abramovich\u2019s yachts many ports in a storm. Even now there is an assumption in the US and Europe to see this purely as Russia versus the rest, as opposed to Russia versus the west. There are many voices instinctively reluctant to defend America after 9/11. They are not prepared to see the conflict in terms of purely good versus evil, or to forget the past 30 years. The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said: \u201cIt was mentioned that Mariupol is Europe\u2019s Aleppo. Well, Aleppo was our Aleppo. The engagement of the global community \u2013 of the powers that could be affected \u2013 now and then was quite different.\u201d Hina Rabbani Khar, the former foreign minister of Pakistan, said the value system the west deployed inside its border was different from that outside its borders. \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n, an experienced adviser to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, never mentioned Biden by name but urged caution, saying: \u201cEvery step we take, every move that we make in regard to bringing an end to this war is going to have an impact on the future security architecture. Russia is not going to go away as a country. \u201cThe power of this equilibrium that has shaped the international order ever since the end of the cold war over the last three decades has everything to do with this crisis. We have to create an environment in which every country, from Russia, Iran, the US, European countries, from Turkey to Gulf countries, feel safe enough in the international order that they do not resort to any kind of disruptive action. This is an unfair, unprovoked war, but whatever grievances Russia has had have to be understood \u2013 not justified, but understood. If everybody burns bridges with Russia there is no one talking to them at the end of the day.\u201d At least the episode may have the salutary effect of forcing the west to think more clearly about what its endgame may be. A permanently weakened Russia, humiliated while attempting to capture Ukraine, its lucrative European energy market permanently thrown away by Putin\u2019s crazed misreading of history, is hardly going to form a secure basis for him to remain in power as long as he intends. Ideally he is defeated in elections or is bundled out the door by the security services. But that is Russia\u2019s business, not Biden\u2019s."

                    "body": "Churchillian echoes from Volodymyr Zelenskiy stiffened the sinews and summoned up the blood of the House of Commons: \u201cWe will fight in the forests, in the fields, the shores and in the streets.\u201d Each of us, distant spectators of unfolding catastrophe, tries to imagine those missiles pulverising our streets, willing Zelenskiy and his country to survive. But, being human, even in our darkest hour we cleave to another wartime maxim attributed to Churchill: never let a good crisis go to waste. Look around in Britain and you can see all sides scurrying to make good use of this. You could call it cynical opportunism \u2013 or if you have a more benign view of human nature, it\u2019s a natural impulse to rescue some hope from Putin\u2019s hell. Start with the left, the internationalists, the progressives, the social democrats, living for ever in hope that events will prove us so incontrovertibly right that more people will swing our way, ending the electoral hegemony of Conservatism.  The first light in the tunnel: Britain is back close to Europe. Without gloating or saying we told you so, it is worth pointing out that this war proves, beyond geography, that Britain\u2019s destiny is European. In defence, as in trade, we belong inalienably to this democratic neighbourhood. Europe is us, physically, politically and psychologically, while \u201cglobal Britain\u201d was a vacuous nothing. Ukraine yearns to join, so ask them if Brussels is the \u201cEUSSR\u201d of that crass Brexit slogan. Last week, the EU invited the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to its Foreign Affairs Council meeting for the first time since Brexit. In a double somersault, Truss called it \u201cvitally important\u201d that the UK and its allies \u201cshow complete unity\u201d. Most who caused Brexit fall silent, leaving only the Europhobic fringe sounding off: Steve Baker, of the European Research Group, called for Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol to be triggered \u201cimmediately\u201d while on a visit to Belfast last week. But fighting the EU over sausages on the Irish border is far out of step with the times. The spasm of xenophobia that was spread by the Brexiteers has lifted, too. A YouGov poll has found three-quarters of voters want Ukrainians admitted immediately without visas. Johnson will be dogged by the shame of Tory mean-spiritedness as other countries threw open their borders. The divide between climate activists and petrol-heads has been deepened by this war, too. Ending oil and gas dependency is now clearly a defence as well as a climate priority; the need to accelerate renewables, home insulation and heat pump installation, to make net zero reachable has never felt more urgent. Look, the possibility of an energy-generating barrage on the Severn estuary is back on the agenda. Energy independence has become a security issue, says Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, calling on consumers to defeat Putin. Cutting road speeds to 55mph and turning down central heating would \u201cmake an immediate impact\u201d on Russia, he says. But against him stands FairFuelUK, \u201cthe real voice of the UK\u2019s 37m drivers\u201d, seizing its chance for petrol tax cuts after years of frightening the government out of fuel tax rises. Thirst for gas and oil exposes western dependence on other dictators \u2013 the Saudis, Qatar \u2013 while US emissaries are suddenly visiting the outcast Maduro of Venezuela. \u201cClimate sceptics\u201d and oil company-funded pressure groups seize on the new energy gap as their big chance, too. \u201cFrack us out of the fuel crisis, Boris!\u201d \u2013 the Mail reports as Craig Mackinlay rallies his Net Zero Security Group of Tories. Johnson always appeases his right: sealing off shale gas wells does \u201cnot make sense,\u201d he says now, never mind the years it would take to reap any supposed benefits from the wells. Nigel Farage is on the move, too, calling for a referendum to kill off net-zero targets and the \u201cruinous\u201d green agenda. As for the prime minister, Ukraine is his hope of salvation: surely, war is no time for a leadership election over parties long forgotten? War may save his skin when the police and Sue Gray eventually come knocking. Watch the retreat of erstwhile Tory enemies such as Rory Stewart: \u201cI think he\u2019s a terrible human being. I think he\u2019s a terrible prime minister, but I think he\u2019s done OK on the Ukraine crisis.\u201d  Here\u2019s another hope: war may stop the government\u2019s assault on the BBC, Britain\u2019s greatest global influencer. How like Putin does Johnson want to be? Another hope is for an end to the London laundromat hiding money filched from other citizens. But will the City be cleansed or just whitewashed? And there\u2019s the economy: as the war deepens the cost-of-living calamity, the chancellor can\u2019t avoid a U-turn in his spring statement. Tory MPs join Labour in calling a halt to April\u2019s unequal national insurance rise. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, says people are \u201cwilling to endure hardships\u201d in solidarity with Ukraine. But will the public demand equality in who bears that pain? Millions of the hard-pressed will join battalions of the absolutely poor neither heating nor eating unless this talk of \u201csacrifice\u201d summons genuine wartime fairness, tapping into wealth to guarantee enough for everyone. Will we all be in this together? The old tug-of-war between tax rises and spending cuts is unabated, the likes of Roger Bootle, chair of Capital Economics, saying defence spending may have to rise to 4% at the expense of cuts. But from which already starved services: the NHS? Schools? Border Force? The right never says. The chancellor needs to eat the words in his ill-judged Mais lecture promising tax cuts. Putin may succeed militarily in the near future, though he may never hold down Ukraine \u2013 that vast, rebellious country. On the home front, the question is what the war will do to us. The left always lives in optimism that fairer and greener choices will prevail, but the left is also used to disappointment. The fight is on to see if this brings out the best in us, and not the worst.  Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist "

A final vote is expected soon and will be covered in a news story. The politics blog will be back tomorrow morning. Here\u2019s where things stand:  US Senate to vote on legislation codifying federal rights to same-sex and interracial marriage in the US. The upper chamber is debating a bill right now. A bill to avert the looming US passenger and freight rail strike will be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives early tomorrow, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after a meeting at the White House with Joe Biden and the other congressional leaders. Record early voting is happening in Georgia. The number of people casting their ballots during early voting in the run-off election for one of the state\u2019s seats in the US Senate is already on its way to half a million since the process got under way at the weekend. Polls close 6 December. Nato foreign ministers pledged to step up support to Ukraine and help repair its energy infrastructure amid a wave of Russian attacks that have repeatedly knocked out power supplies and heating for millions of Ukrainians. Joe Biden has urged the US Congress to intervene to prevent the rail strike that is looming across America and could bring passenger and freight trains screeching to a halt as early as next week. This puts the pro-labor president at loggerheads with some of the key rail unions.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    9.10pm   US Senate to vote on legislation codifying right to gay and interracial marriage in US  The US Senate is currently debating proposed amendments to the bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act that seeks to codify in legislation the right to same-sex and interracial marriages in the US. It\u2019s expected to pass when it comes to a final vote a bit later this afternoon, from whence it will go back to the House, where it is also expected to pass, and speed its way to Joe Biden\u2019s desk to be signed into law in December. Earlier this month, 12 Republican senators voted with all Senate Democrats to advance the bill. The bill has Democratic and Republican sponsors and was spearheaded by Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, the first openly lesbian or gay senator in the US.  The expected passage of the legislation with support from both parties is an extraordinary sign of the shifting politics on the issue and a measure of relief for the hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples who have married since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 Obergefell v Hodges decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide, the Associated Press writes. The bill has gained steady momentum since the supreme court\u2019s June decision that overturned the federal right to an abortion, and comments from Justice Clarence Thomas at the time that suggested same-sex marriage could also come under threat. Bipartisan Senate negotiations kick-started this summer after 47 Republicans unexpectedly voted for a House bill and gave supporters new optimism. The legislation would not codify the Obergefell decision or force any state to allow same-sex couples to marry. But it would require states to recognize all marriages that were legal where they were performed, and protect current same-sex unions, if Obergefell were to be overturned. It would also protect interracial marriages by requiring states to recognize legal marriages regardless of \u201csex, race, ethnicity, or national origin\u201d.  Updated at 9.12pm GMT    8.27pm    The US supreme court today wrestled with a partisan-tinged dispute over a Biden administration policy that would prioritize deportation of people in the country illegally who pose the greatest public safety risk, the Associated Press writes. It was not clear after arguments that stretched past two hours and turned highly contentious at times whether the justices would allow the policy to take effect, or side with Republican-led states that have so far succeeded in blocking it. At the center of the case is a September 2021 directive from the Department of Homeland Security that paused deportations unless individuals had committed acts of terrorism, espionage or \u201cegregious threats to public safety\u201d. The guidance, issued after Joe Biden became president, updated a Trump-era policy that removed people in the country illegally regardless of criminal history or community ties. Today, the administration\u2019s top supreme court lawyer told the justices that federal law does \u201cnot create an unyielding mandate to apprehend and remove\u201d every one of the more than 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said it would be \u201cincredibly destabilizing on the ground\u201d for the high court to require that. Congress has not given DHS enough money to vastly increase the number of people it holds and deports, the Biden administration has said. But Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone told the court that the administration violated federal law requiring the detention of people who are in the US illegally and who have been convicted of serious crimes. Chief Justice John Roberts was among the conservative justices who pushed back strongly on the Biden administration\u2019s arguments.  It\u2019s our job to say what the law is, not whether or not it can be possibly implemented or whether there are difficulties there, and I don\u2019t think we should change that responsibility just because Congress and the executive can\u2019t agree on something ... I don\u2019t think we should let them off the hook,\u201d he said.  Yet Roberts, in questioning Stone, also called Prelogar\u2019s argument compelling. Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, made clear they believed that Texas and Louisiana, which joined Texas in suing over the directive, weren\u2019t even entitled to bring their case.  Updated at 8.32pm GMT    8.04pm    As Joe Biden is dependent on Congress to avoid a government shutdown on December 16, the president wants a government funding bill passed to provide additional money for the Covid-19 response and to bolster US support for Ukraine\u2019s economy and defense against Russia\u2019s invasion, the Associated Press reports. Lawmakers are months behind on passing funding legislation for the current fiscal year, relying on stop-gap measures that largely maintain existing funding levels, that federal agencies have warned leaves them strapped for cash.  We\u2019re going to work together, I hope, to fund the government,\u201d Biden told lawmakers, emphasizing the importance of Ukraine and pandemic funding as well.  Meeting in the Roosevelt Room at the White House earlier, Biden sat at the head of the conference table, flanked on either side by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the two smiling brightly at the start of the meeting. Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sat next to Schumer, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was next to Pelosi and appeared more reserved.  As the meeting began, Biden quipped, \u201cI\u2019m sure this is going to go very quickly\u201d to reach agreement on everything. Lawmakers spent a bit more than an hour with the president, who was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and senior aides. McCarthy is working to become speaker in January, though he must first overcome dissent within the GOP conference to win a floor vote on January 3. All the leaders said their preference was to pass a comprehensive spending bill for the fiscal year, rather than a continuing resolution (CR) that largely maintains existing funding levels. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have an option we may have to have a yearlong\u201d stop-gap bill, Pelosi added. McCarthy, who has promised to look more critically at the Biden administration\u2019s requests for Ukraine aid, told reporters that, \u201cI\u2019m not for a blank check for anything.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t necessarily opposed to more funding, but wanted to ensure \u201cthere\u2019s accountability and audits.\u201d Schumer and Pelosi popped out of the west wing after the meeting to take questions from reporters and were followed shortly afterwards by McCarthy who did the same. On a spending bill, Pelosi said: \u201cWe have to have a bipartisan agreement on what the top line is.\u201d CNN reported that McConnell eschewed such an appearance and returned directly to Capitol Hill.      7.36pm   Interim summary  It\u2019s been a lively morning in US politics and there\u2019s more to come. Joe Biden is en route to Michigan to tour a factory and talk about the economy and the US Senate is poised to vote on a bill codifying same-sex and interracial marriage. Here\u2019s where things stand:  A bill to avert the looming US passenger and freight rail strike will be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives early tomorrow, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after a meeting at the White House with Joe Biden and the other congressional leaders. Record early voting is happening in Georgia. The number of people casting their ballots during early voting in the run-off election for one of the state\u2019s seats in the US Senate is already on its way to half a million since the process got under way at the weekend. Polls close 6 December. Nato foreign ministers pledged to step up support to Ukraine and help repair its energy infrastructure amid a wave of Russian attacks that have repeatedly knocked out power supplies and heating for millions of Ukrainians. Joe Biden has urged the US Congress to intervene to prevent the rail strike that is looming across America and could bring passenger and freight trains screeching to a halt as early as next week. This puts the pro-labor president at loggerheads with some of the key rail unions.   Updated at 7.37pm GMT    7.11pm    Joe Biden is on his way to Michigan, aboard Air Force One right now, to tour the SK Siltron CSS semiconductor facility in Bay City, on the shore of Lake Huron. It\u2019s part of his agenda to promote progress in rebuilding the US manufacturing sector. A local ABC channel described how SK Siltron recently completed a $300m expansion. The firm makes semiconductor wafers \u201cused in power system components for electric vehicles and 5G cellular technology,\u201d the outlet reported ahead of the president\u2019s visit this afternoon. The ABC report noted that \u201clocal, state and federal leaders hailed the project as an example of the US bringing semiconductor manufacturing back home during a crippling supply shortage of the devices.\u201d He\u2019s due to speak about the US economy a bit later. He\u2019s being accompanied on the factory tour by newly-reelected Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, congresswoman Elissa Slotkin and others.      6.31pm    When Mitt Romney compared Donald Trump to a gargoyle \u2026 Hats off to Politico for gathering this reporting. The outlet reports that senior Republicans Mike Pence, Bill Cassidy, Marco Rubio, Susan Collins and John Thune all directly or obliquely criticized Trump\u2019s meeting with the far right\u2019s Nick Fuentes last week, as senators returned to Capitol Hill after the Thanksgiving break. But it noted this choice comment, that Utah Republican Senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney was \u201cparticularly sharp\u201d on Trump, in general, and noted that he was not a fan of the former president running for office again, as he intends to in 2024 and said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want him hanging over our party like a gargoyle.\u201d  Here\u2019s NBC:   Updated at 6.37pm GMT    5.52pm    House Republican leader and would-be next speaker Kevin McCarthy has spoken out for the first time to condemn the meeting between Donald Trump and blatant white supremacist and antisemite Nick Fuentes last week. McCarthy spoke about several topics as he emerged from the west wing of the White House a little earlier, following a meeting called there by Joe Biden with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to talk about urgent legislative business before the year end. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes. He has no place in this Republican Party,\u201d McCarthy told reporters at the White House. McCarthy is the latest GOP figure to speak out, following a series of senior Republicans and pressure group leaders condemning the fact that Trump had dinner last week with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who is in deep controversy for antisemitic remarks, and Fuentes, who accompanied Ye. As the Guardian\u2019s Edwin Rios noted it was just the latest in a long line of incidents involving the former US president and the far right. McCarthy did stumble though. He said that Trump had four times condemned Fuentes and did not know who he was. Reporters on the scene immediately pounced to note, accurately, that Trump has not condemned Fuentes and his racist views. McCarthy responded: \u201cWell, I condemn.\u201d On Sunday, Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said the meeting between Trump, Ye and Fuentes \u201cwas not accidental.\u201d Moments earlier, when asked if it was appropriate for Trump to meet with Ye, McCarthy said Trump could have meetings \u201cwith who he wants.\u201d Then went onto criticize Fuentes.  But also Ye, sort of?   Updated at 6.56pm GMT    5.06pm   Bill to avert looming rail strike to reach House floor  Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just emerged from the White House to talk about their meeting just now with Joe Biden to talk about legislation in the lame duck session and, most urgently, his request that Congress intervene to stop the looming rail strike. Schumer signaled the Senate would support the move. Pelosi said: \u201cTomorrow morning we will have a bill on the floor, it will come up as early as 9am.\u201d Biden wants Congress to impose the agreement tentatively reached in September, but which four unions didn\u2019t sign on to, forcing the president and the labor unions to be at loggerheads. Pelosi said the original elements of the agreement, on pay, etc, would be included in the bill and some \u201cadditional benefits\u201d agreed to by Biden and labor secretary Marty Walsh. She said the agreement \u201cis not everything I would like to see, I would like to see paid sick leave \u2013 every [leading democratic] country in the world has it. I don\u2019t like going against the ability of a union to strike but, weighing the equities, we must avoid a strike.\u201d Assuming the House votes for the bill, it will then move to the Senate for a vote there. Schumer said: \u201cWe will try to get it done \u2026 we are going to try to solve this ASAP.\u201d Both leaders warned of job losses and further supply chain problems affecting ordinary goods and essential things such as chlorine for safe public water supplies.  House minority leader Kevin McCarthy emerged from the West Wing a few minutes after Schumer and Pelosi spoke to gathered reporters and indicated that he expected a resolution on the rail strike. Schumer had earlier noted that he had minority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s support in the Senate. All 100 senators must agree to hold a quick vote like this and it\u2019s unclear yet if all are on board, especially Bernie Sanders.   Updated at 5.51pm GMT    4.51pm    Despite the extensive efforts of progressive organizers in Georgia, the state\u2019s early voting operation has run into some significant issues. Many voters reported long lines at polling places over the weekend, as they tried to cast ballots in Georgia\u2019s Senate runoff election. One of the candidates in that race, Democrat Raphael Warnock, the incumbent, waited in line for about an hour on Sunday to cast his vote. A coalition of progressive groups has launched a massive canvassing operation to help ensure that voters know how and when they can cast their ballots.  Hillary Holley, executive director of the progressive group Care in Action, said that canvassers have encountered a lot of misunderstanding among voters as they knock on doors. \u201cEvery time basically our canvassers reach a voter at their house, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Thank you so much because we are so confused about when we can go vote,\u2019\u201d Holley said on a Monday press call. Part of that confusion stems from a judge\u2019s last-minute ruling that counties could allow early voting to occur on the Saturday after the Thanksgiving holiday. Georgia election officials had initially said that early voting could not take place on that day, but the Warnock campaign won a legal challenge to expand voting hours. Stephanie Jackson Ali, policy director of the progressive group New Georgia Project, said: \u201cOur call is for counties to continue the fight to get more locations open, to continue the fight to keep your counties open late, and for our voters to stay in line.\u201d      4.34pm    Progressives in Georgia are leaving nothing to chance with just one week to go before polls close in the state\u2019s Senate runoff election. A coalition of progressive groups has launched a massive canvassing effort for the Democratic party since election day, when neither Democrat Raphael Warnock nor Republican Herschel Walker were able to win enough support to avoid a runoff. Leaders of the coalition, known as Georgia Organizers for Active Transformation, said on a Monday press call that they now have 2,500 canvassers knocking on 200,000 doors a day. In total, the canvassers have knocked on more than 2.5 million doors since the Thursday after election day, which was three weeks ago. Progressives\u2019 work already appears to be paying dividends. More than 150,000 Georgians cast their ballots over the weekend, as early voting got underway, and there was record turnout on Monday, the first day of statewide early voting. According to the progressive group Progress Georgia, African Americans and women are currently outpacing their high turnout levels in the 2020 general election. Given that those constituencies lean toward Democrats, the early voting data could provide some reassurance to the camp of Warnock as he defends the seat he has only held since 2021. \u201cGeorgia voters know exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Hillary Holley, a coalition leader and the executive director of Care in Action. \u201cThey know what the stakes are, and they want Warnock to remain representing them for six additional years.\u201d      4.16pm   Record early voting in Georgia Senate seat runoff  The number of people casting their ballots during early voting in the run-off election for one of Georgia\u2019s seats in the US Senate is already on its way to half a million since the process got under way at the weekend. Monday saw a record turnout, with reports varying from more than 250,000 voters to in excess of 300,000 people voting on the first day of state-wide early operation of the polls (some counties began earlier). Incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger Herschel Walker are neck-and-neck ahead of the election on 6 December. Deputy secretary of state Gabriel Sterling said it was the largest in-person early voting day in Georgia history.  Neither candidate got above the 50% threshold in the midterm elections earlier this month and under Georgia rules the fierce race went to a runoff.  Updated at 4.22pm GMT    4.01pm    A quick pool report from Washington: President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have been meeting with congressional leaders in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, moments ago. The president made brief remarks but did not take shouted questions from the pool, your pooler notes.  I asked for top leaders in Congress to come in and talk about what we\u2019re going to do between now and Christmas. There\u2019s a lot to do, including resolving the train strike,\u201d Biden said.  He also mentioned funding the federal government, the ongoing coronavirus response and the war in Ukraine.  And we\u2019re going to find other areas of common ground,\u201d the president added.  Pate-spotters may or may not be able to identify all the people in the room from this pic tweeted by pooler. Chuck Schumer next to Veep, surely? At right, the inscrutable Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell.   Updated at 4.15pm GMT    3.55pm   US and Nato allies pledge continued support for Ukraine  Nato foreign ministers today pledged to step up support to Ukraine and help repair its energy infrastructure amid a wave of Russian attacks that have repeatedly knocked out power supplies and heating for millions of Ukrainians, Reuters reports.  Russia\u2019s aggression, including its persistent and unconscionable attacks on Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure, is depriving millions of Ukrainians of basic human services,\u201d the foreign ministers said in a statement after a first day of talks in Bucharest, Romania.  They condemned what they called Russia\u2019s cruelty against Ukraine\u2019s civilians and promised to assist the country as it repairs its energy infrastructure.  We will continue and further step up political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity...and will maintain our support for as long as necessary,\u201d the statement noted.  Foreign ministers also confirmed a 2008 Nato summit decision that Ukraine will eventually become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense alliance. Since then, however, leaders have not taken any concrete steps such as giving Kyiv a membership action plan that would lay out a timetable for bringing the country closer to Nato.

Updated at 4.21pm GMT    3.30pm    Talking up labor unions as a senator or a candidate or when you\u2019re president and opening a factory is one thing but facing a national rail strike as the festive seasons looms is quite another \u2013 especially for Joe Biden. Here\u2019s some interesting perspective directly from Politico. The outlet writes in this morning\u2019s, Politico Playbook dispatch from the front lines in Washington: In 1992, two days into a crippling railroad strike, then-Senator Joe Biden came to the Senate floor and decried the lopsided nature of federal labor laws dealing with the rail industry \u2013 laws, he argued, that essentially allowed corporations, regulators and, ultimately, Congress to run roughshod over workers. \u201cWe need to restore a measure of balance to these negotiations,\u201d he said, before voting with just five other senators against halting the strike. Thirty years later, as president, Biden is turning to those very same laws to prevent another strike and impose a tentative contract agreement that his administration brokered but multiple rail unions voted to reject. \u201cAs a proud pro-labor president, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,\u201d the president said in a statement. \u201cBut in this case \u2013 where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families \u2013 I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.\u201d Translation: It\u2019s a lot easier to be \u201cUnion Joe\u201d as one senator among 100 than it is as president of the United States \u2013 especially during holiday shopping season and a persistent bout of inflation. People familiar with the process told us last night that Biden and his advisers determined that the risk to the economy was just too great. A strike would disrupt supply chains \u2013 including such critical goods as motor fuels and water treatment chemicals \u2013 and could ultimately cost the U.S. economy $1 billion within a week, according to analysis from the Anderson Economic Group \u2026 \u2026 Until Monday, administration officials remained engaged in resolving the dispute. But Biden [he was advised by Cabinet folks that] there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table and recommended he ask Congress to impose the September deal \u2026 \u2026 One former [unnamed] labor department official told Politico:  There is a sentiment among some railroad workers that they thought the president was going to absolutely battle all the way to the end to get them exactly what they wanted. He\u2019s going to have some unhappy people. I think there\u2019s going to be some grumbling in the labor movement.\u201d  The former official was hopeful that Biden\u2019s pro-union history couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t be overshadowed by this one decision. That remains to be seen.   Updated at 3.41pm GMT    3.02pm    Workers in four unions, including the largest, have rejected the tentative rail industry deal, while workers in eight unions have approved it, Reuters\u2019 reporting continues. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack have been involved in discussions with the rail industry, unions and agriculture industry stakeholders.  Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the commerce committee, praised Biden\u2019s call to Congress to act and said no one side was fully happy with the compromise contract deal \u201cbut the responsible thing to do is avoid the strike.\u201d The Association of American Railroads said \u201ccongressional action to prevent a work stoppage in this manner is appropriate ... No one benefits from a rail work stoppage \u2013 not our customers, not rail employees and not the American economy.\u201d In a letter yesterday, the US Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, National Retail Federation, American Petroleum Institute, National Restaurant Association, American Trucking Associations and other groups warned that impacts of a potential strike could be felt as soon as 5 December.Biden said Congress  Should set aside politics and partisan division and deliver for the American people. Congress should get this bill to my desk well in advance of December 9th so we can avoid disruption.\u201d  The letter to congressional leaders, first reported by Reuters, warned that a strike could halt passenger railroad Amtrak and commuter rail services that \u201cwould disrupt up to 7 million travelers a day\u201d. It added:  The risks to our nation\u2019s economy and communities simply make a national rail strike unacceptable.\u201d  Biden\u2019s Presidential Emergency Board in August released the framework for the tentative deal forged in September between major railroads and a dozen unions representing 115,000 workers. Those carriers include Union Pacific, Berkshire Hathaway Inc\u2019s BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern. Unions and railroads have until Dec. 9 to resolve differences. If they do not, workers could strike or railroads could lock out employees - unless Congress intervenes. But railroads would halt hazardous materials shipments at least four days ahead of a strike deadline.  Updated at 3.24pm GMT    2.40pm    Joe Biden last night called on Congress to intervene to avert a potential rail strike that could occur as early as 9 December, warning of a catastrophic economic impact if railroad service ground to a halt, Reuters writes. Biden asked lawmakers to adopt the tentative deal announced in September \u201cwithout any modifications or delay - to avert a potentially crippling national rail shutdown\u201d and added that up to 765,000 Americans \u201ccould be put out of work in the first two weeks alone.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers would take up legislation this week \u201cto prevent a catastrophic nationwide rail strike, which would grind our economy to a halt\u201d.  Yesterday, more than 400 groups called on Congress to intervene in the railroad labor standoff that threatens to idle shipments of food and fuel and strand travelers while inflicting billions of dollars of economic damage. A rail traffic stoppage could freeze almost 30% of US cargo shipments by weight, stoke inflation and cost the American economy as much as $2bn a day by unleashing a cascade of transport woes affecting US energy, agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and retail sectors.  A rail shutdown would devastate our economy. Without freight rail, many U.S. industries would shut down ... Communities could lose access to chemicals necessary to ensure clean drinking water. Farms and ranches across the country could be unable to feed their livestock,\u201d Joe Biden said in a statement last night.  The president hailed the contract deal that includes a 24% compounded wage increase over a five-year period from 2020 through 2024 and five annual $1,000 lump-sum payments.   Updated at 2.46pm GMT    2.23pm    Joe Biden is convening congressional leaders to discuss legislative priorities through the end of the year, according to the White House. There are no further details yet from a snap report from the Reuters news agency but we\u2019ll bring you the news as it develops. The urgent rail industry matter notwithstanding, our Washington colleague Lauren Gambino examines what the still-Democratic controlled Congress can get done in this \u201clame duck\u201d session before Republicans take charge of the House with a slim majority early next year. Lauren writes that: As a new era of divided government looms in the US, Democrats are rushing to complete a lengthy legislative to-do list that includes landmark civil liberties legislation, a routine but critical spending package and a bill to prevent another January 6. There are only a handful of working days left before the balance of power in Congress shifts and Democrats\u2019 unified control of government in Washington ends. In January, Republicans will claim the gavel in the House, giving them veto power over much of Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. You can read the rest of her analysis report here.   Updated at 2.24pm GMT    2.14pm   Biden at loggerheads with unions over push to stop rail strike  Joe Biden has urged the US Congress to intervene to prevent the rail strike that is looming across America and could bring passenger and freight trains screeching to a halt as early as next week. The US president warns that a rail strike will put more than three quarters of a million Americans out of work very quickly \u2013 and one expert analysis estimates it would cost the economy $1bn in the first week. But asking Congress to force through a tentative agreement reached in September that\u2019s supported by some \u2013 but very much not by all \u2013 the rail unions involved puts him at loggerheads with organized labor in the US. That goes sharply against his track record as a vociferous supporter of unions through thick and thin over decades and a reputation as perhaps the most pro-labor president in US history. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will support action from Congress, to avert strikes from December 9, while House majority leader Chuck Schumer has not placed his cards down yet. Labor secretary Marty Walsh helped mediate negotiations between rail companies and unions earlier in the fall. Four key unions refused to sign up. Will Vermont\u2019s socialist and independent US Senator Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats, support a government-imposed resolution?      1.47pm   Biden clashes with unions as he urges Congress to derail train strike  Good Morning, US politics live blog readers, the White House is a hive of activity, it\u2019s early voting a go-go in Georgia and there\u2019s a lively day in store on Capitol Hill, so stay with us for all the news as it happens. Here\u2019s what afoot:  Joe Biden has always championed labor unions in America, whether fashionable or not, but now that he\u2019s president he\u2019s staring at a holiday-season rail strike that he says threatens the economy \u2013 and he\u2019s urged Congress to intervene and prevent it by imposing a deal some unions hate. The US president is traveling to Michigan today to tour a semiconductor facility as he seeks to promote his agenda, especially in swing states, of boosting manufacturing in the US and his stewardship of the economy. More than 400,000 voters have already cast their ballots since early voting began in the Georgia midterms run-off for the US Senate seat held since the 2020 election by Democrat Raphael Warnock. He\u2019s neck-and-neck with Republican challenger Herschel Walker. The election\u2019s next Tuesday. Mike Lindell, he of foamy pillows and foaming-at-the-mouth promotion of the lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election, is running to become the chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Mitt Romney has compared Trump to a gargoyle.   "

                    "body": "Nowadays Ben White\u2019s choice of match-day food does not stray too far beyond pasta, but he remembers a time when Newport County had different ways to get their squad fired up. It was the 2017-18 season and White was on loan at the League Two club from Brighton, taking his first significant steps in a professional career that at one stage appeared to have slipped away. \u201cIt was one of the best years of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go there and everything is completely different. You\u2019re having curry for your pre-match meal.\u201d  The smooth edges of academy football could not have felt further away and that was reinforced when, at half-time of his debut, White witnessed what he describes as \u201ca punch-up between our own players in our own dressing room\u201d. In fairness he does not suggest his present-day Arsenal teammates are shrinking violets and they have certainly not bowed to anyone on the pitch. He is in the England squad for the first time since Euro 2020 and that is because it would be hard to find a Premier League centre-back in better form. White might not fit the hackneyed portrait of a swashbuckling, gnarled international centre-half but he has toughness in spades, along with a perceptiveness on the ball that has added fresh dimensions to Mikel Arteta\u2019s lines of attack. \u201cIt shows that what I\u2019ve done this season is really paying off,\u201d says White, sitting in a meeting room at St George\u2019s Park. There were plenty who failed to see sense in Arsenal paying Brighton \u00a355m for him last summer: he had, after all, been dodging the flying fists at Rodney Parade only three years previously and had played only 36 times in the Premier League. But his stature grows by the week and it seems a long time since a torrid debut in which Ivan Toney and Brentford offered plenty of ammunition to those who doubted his value. \u201cThe start of the season was tough,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had the first game and it wasn\u2019t ideal for me, I didn\u2019t play very well and then I got Covid so I was out for another two games. It was hard to get started; it wasn\u2019t the start I wanted but, coming through the season now, I\u2019m playing every week, the team is doing really well and it\u2019s very positive.\u201d  After failing to pass the Bees\u2019 aerial examination, White was singled out by Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher as a potential achilles heel under high balls. He is 6ft 1in, on the short side for a centre-back, although you would hardly know from his dominance in duels nowadays. \u201cI think it was the first time I\u2019ve actually been singled out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s never a nice feeling, it\u2019s not very good, but it just gives me more incentive to go out there and play well. \u201cSome of it you obviously have to look at and see what they\u2019ve said, and some of the stuff they said was true [in] that game. It wasn\u2019t my best. Obviously they\u2019ve had amazing careers and hopefully one day I could have something like that.\u201d To begin with he should add to his two caps over the next five days, when England face Switzerland and Ivory Coast in friendlies at Wembley. If Newport seems a lifetime ago then the day in 2014 when he was rejected by Southampton at 16 must feel as if it was inflicted upon a different person.  \u201cI got told I wasn\u2019t going to get anything; Mum took me and our chat was a little quiet on the way home,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I wanted to carry on, it was obviously tough not being wanted. You don\u2019t know if there is going to be anyone else who wants you; if they don\u2019t want you, other teams at that level won\u2019t. So it was kind of a feeling of: \u2018Where do I go from here?\u2019\u201d Despite the sense of despair, the news had not come as a shock. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t good enough when I was younger. I was a late developer, probably as tall as I am now but really skinny, gangly, couldn\u2019t really run. And I didn\u2019t play at all when I was there. \u201cThere were always people playing in front of me. I\u2019d get 10 minutes here and there, and that\u2019s not enough to be able to show what you\u2019ve got.\u201d A gruelling and sometimes dispiriting set of trials was the only option. White remembers a three-day trial at Bristol Rovers that he curtailed early. \u201cI only did two because we were literally just running up hills,\u201d he says. \u201cAbsolutely killed me, couldn\u2019t do it. Then I got a trial at Leicester: went there, they didn\u2019t offer me anything. It was all at right-back, so I hadn\u2019t ever played at centre-half before. \u201cThen I went to Brighton for a trial against Brentford: that was when I first started playing centre-back. Afterwards they said to my mum: \u2018We need to know by Tuesday because we want to offer him a scholarship and, if you don\u2019t know by then, the contract\u2019s gone.\u2019\u201d  White\u2019s mind was essentially made up for him: other options were hardly abundant. The rest is history and he says, in typically laid-back fashion, that he \u201cjust went with the flow\u201d in chasing his career, although he admits later that there was \u201conly plan A for me \u2026 no backup\u201d. He has stated in the past that he watches little football but that is patently not the same as being unwilling to devote oneself to a life in the game. Now he has the chance to make one as a regular international and, looking down England\u2019s list of centre-back contenders, it is hard to make a case that any of his colleagues are in better shape. He dodges the question of Harry Maguire\u2019s form, refusing to entertain suggestions a starting place at Qatar 2022 is in his grasp. But it will be on the table if his rise continues, and if the toughness learned in that curry-fuelled spell at Newport keeps augmenting his technical grace.  \u201cIt was a bit scary, to be fair; I didn\u2019t want to make any mistakes, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he says of the interval fight he witnessed at the fourth-tier club. White has shown this season that, if one or two do slip in, he tends to learn from them."

                    "body": "When Chelsea and Manchester City step out at a sold-out Plough Lane on Saturday, somewhat incomprehensibly it will be the first time English football\u2019s two dominant teams of recent years have met in a cup final. Since 2014 they have played one another in seven semi-finals and two quarter-finals and the Chelsea full-back Jonna Andersson is relishing the Continental League Cup final. \u201cFinally,\u201d she says. \u201cWe always say that we\u2019re going to get them in the semi-finals. We were quite surprised when we didn\u2019t, and now it\u2019s finally a final. Hopefully both teams are happy about it because it\u2019s a good final for us to play but also for people watching.\u201d  Chelsea are six points above City in the league with a game in hand and have done the WSL double over them, but any suggestion that Saturday\u2019s game may not be a contest would be far from the mark. City staggered early in the season, hindered by injuries, losing seven of their first 14 matches in all competitions. Since then, though, they have lost once in 12 games: 1-0 against Chelsea. Chelsea faltered, too, picking up one win in five after their swashbuckling 3-0 defeat of Arsenal in the 2020-21 FA Cup final at the start of December, but are since unbeaten in six. Emma Hayes\u2019s side are perhaps still favourites, although we are yet to see whether the off-field turmoil around the club seeps on to it. Andersson\u2019s key task will be dealing with City\u2019s potent wingers Lauren Hemp and Jess Park.  \u201cThey have so many good players and especially wingers that like going forward with a lot of pace and that are very good one versus one,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just need to focus on our gameplan and what we can do, but of course we need to try to stop them as well because we know that\u2019s one of their biggest threats.\u201d  It is in defence where Hayes has been most experimental this season and Andersson and the rest of the players who rotate along the backline have taken time to get used to switching between a back four and back three. \u201cYou just need to be flexible and really, really understand the different kinds of formations because you have to be able to switch between them as well in games or in weeks,\u201d the Sweden international says. \u201cI want to be an attacking full-back. When I\u2019ve been playing as a wing-back in 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 of course I need to be more involved in maybe the one versus one attacking plays so I have to try to improve these kinds of things. When I\u2019ve been a full-back in a back four it\u2019s maybe more coming from behind running overlaps and underlaps.\u201d Andersson has had a solid season, bouncing back from a tough end to the previous campaign, when she was dropped to the bench for Chelsea\u2019s Champions League semi-final second leg and the final. \u201cYou have these moments during the season, during the games,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was maybe a tougher period for me personally, but I still think it\u2019s a team sport and you need to try to stick together. It was a tough time, but I think I\u2019ve learned a lot from it as well and have come out stronger.\u201d She has had to. It had been expected by many that Hayes would dip into the transfer market to improve her options at full-back and the manager admitted early in the season: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t target players, we just didn\u2019t get the ones that we wanted.\u201d Andersson was unfazed by the chatter. \u201cThat\u2019s something the media has said \u2013 Emma has never said it to me \u2013 but I also know that I need to be on top in training and games to be able to play and start for Chelsea. That probably just gives me more energy. It shows that I need to improve and get better every day.\u201d  It is that kind of fight that Hayes looks for in players and is something Chelsea need to power them to an unbeaten run to the end of the season if they are to repeat their domestic treble. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say we\u2019re used to [winning and the pressure] but that\u2019s where we want to be; we want to win everything we can,\u201d Andersson says. \u201cIf we drop some points there is still going to be a big chance to win the league. It\u2019s not finished yet. You can\u2019t tell who\u2019s going to win or who\u2019s going to be the second or third, it\u2019s so even, and you need to take every game as a final.\u201d"

                    "body": "A 37-year partnership between fossil fuel giant Shell and Australia\u2019s national science and technology centre Questacon \u2013 which branded and delivered science activities for children \u2013 is ending. Canberra-based Questacon has also confirmed a four-year, $1m sponsorship deal with Japanese oil and gas company Inpex will not be renewed when it runs out at the end of the financial year. An extra $10m in funding for Questacon in last week\u2019s federal budget was in part designed to cover for the loss of the fossil fuel income from the two partnerships. Climate campaigners said the removal of Questacon\u2019s two main fossil fuel sponsors was \u201cextremely welcome\u201d.  Shell was a main partner from 1985 to 2020 in the Shell Questacon Science Circus, a program of science shows and teacher training described as the \u201cworld\u2019s longest-running science outreach program\u201d. In 2021 and 2022, Questacon said, its deal with Shell was \u201crefocused and realigned\u201d to build capacity for science, technology, engineering and math in regional areas. Shell became a lower-tier \u201csupporting partner\u201d in 2021 and gave $500,000 that year and $250,000 this year. Questacon said in a statement Shell\u2019s funding had \u201cenabled the program to reach more than 2.5 million Australians in more than 600 towns and 100 remote Indigenous communities over this time period\u201d. Questacon said: \u201cThis is the natural conclusion of the partnership arrangement. Questacon and Shell have agreed to exit the partnership as planned in December 2022.\u201d The $1m from Inpex over four years was \u201cto engage young Australians in conversations about energy, including how energy is used and created, the importance of energy and its role in sustainable development\u201d.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  On Inpex, Questacon said: \u201cThis is the natural conclusion of the partnership arrangement. There are no planned partnership activities with Inpex beyond 30 June 2023.\u201d Questacon is a division of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and about half its funding is from government, with the rest coming from partnerships. The statement added the science circus program would be extended after $10m of new funding was announced in last week\u2019s budget. Partnerships did not \u201cprovide the partnering organisation with control over the content of the work that Questacon produces\u201d, it said. A spokesperson for Shell said the company had reviewed its \u201csocial investment strategy\u201d to support \u201cmore activities with direct benefits in communities where we operate\u201d.  The company had \u201cmade the decision to exit the Questacon partnership at the end of the year\u201d but would still invest \u201cin supporting young people develop skills in Stem fields which will be crucial for the energy transition, creating stronger career opportunities in our regions\u201d. Inpex said the company was \u201cproud to be partnering with Questacon to deliver a positive impact in Stem education for students and teachers in Australia and Japan.\u201d \u201cWe believe supporting education helps underpin a cleaner energy future,\u201d a statement added.  Lee Constable, a professional science communicator and former presenter for the Shell Questacon Science Circus, said: \u201cI think [being free of fossil fuel sponsorship] improves the credibility of our national science centre and I would encourage others to consider their fossil fuel sponsorships.\u201d Community pressure is growing against fossil fuel sponsorships and advertising, with some critics likening it to how the tobacco industry used sport advertising to try to improve its public image, only for those adverts to be banned in many countries. Belinda Noble, founder of climate group CommsDeclare, said the Questacon move had come after years of effort by environment groups and advocates to remove fossil fuel influence from education. She said: \u201cThere is no place for fossil fuel sponsorships in a society that is serious about tackling greenhouse gas emissions and Questacon should rule out future partnerships from all companies that profit from high-emissions products."

                    "body": "Frank Lampard clearly suspected things could get worse for Everton when he dissected the first home defeat of his short reign, against Manchester City. But how much worse, and how quickly, will have alarmed a manager who has projected confidence from the moment he was tasked with avoiding the club\u2019s first relegation in 71 years. \u201cDon\u2019t look too much at the table for the next few weeks,\u201d he said a fortnight ago. \u201cI am not buying time with that, we have a lot of points to play for. If we play with the energy and passion we did today, my feeling is, we will be fine.\u201d Then came Tottenham, and a performance so abject that Everton looked condemned at Premier League level. Two home games in the next five days, against Wolves on Sunday and Newcastle on Thursday, will have a major bearing on the final verdict.  \u201cI am not going to lie and say I don\u2019t look at the table,\u201d says Anthony Gordon, the homegrown forward who has sparkled in the rough this season. \u201cI am a human being and I check the scores after games. We are very aware of the position we are in. What choice do we have? It is our fault we are there. We have got to fight. \u201cTottenham was the lowest I\u2019ve felt all season. It was probably one of the lowest I\u2019ve felt in my career. I think it was the heaviest defeat I\u2019ve suffered. I haven\u2019t been the easiest person to be around over the last few days but I\u2019ve still got the same work ethic and am still doing all the right things. I\u2019m ready to go again.\u201d In cold Premier League terms there has been no managerial bounce since Lampard succeeded Rafael Ben\u00edtez five weeks ago. Four defeats in five top-flight games represents a deflating start, although the new manager\u2019s record reads three wins in seven matches with FA Cup victories against Brentford and non-league Boreham Wood included.  There has, however, been a marked improvement in the intensity, organisation and overall quality of Everton\u2019s home performances. An instant connection between Lampard and the Everton fanbase has turned Goodison Park from a toxic environment into an asset once again. With seven home league games remaining, and the \u201cnight and day\u201d contrast with their away form, as Lampard described it on Monday, it is clear where potential salvation lies. \u201cNot many teams have the fanbase we have,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cSo when you experience games at Goodison the atmosphere is incredible. It gives players a massive boost. It is like that all over the league but even more so with us because of the massive fanbase. Away from home I put it down to us having a tough season, the squad has lost confidence over time, and it can be tough to go away without confidence.  \u201cWe can\u2019t keep making the same mistakes. The good teams don\u2019t make the same mistakes twice. It\u2019s got to be top performance after top performance and that takes character and togetherness within the team. It\u2019s difficult because I don\u2019t think you can build character \u2013 it has to be already in you. It\u2019s about having your own individual pride as a player \u2013 1 to 11. If you\u2019ve got that then you\u2019ll be fine. We just need to stick together and bring it out of each other more. It\u2019s about taking that little bit of responsibility yourself and holding each other accountable. If we do that, then we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Some have been ludicrously quick to pin the very real threat of relegation on Lampard, as though five weeks with a team that had collected six points from the previously available 42 before he arrived is long enough to address six years of damaging mismanagement under Farhad Moshiri. The same critics shovel the falsehood that Ben\u00edtez was hounded out of Everton because of his Liverpool history, when it was appalling results, performances and internal divisions that did for the most misguided of managerial appointments. That is also on Moshiri who, along with trying to finance the new \u00a3500m-plus stadium at Bramley Moore dock, has had to cut commercial sponsorship ties with his business associate the oligarch Alisher Usmanov as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. A first relegation since 1951 would have dire financial consequences for a club already navigating Premier League profit and sustainability rules. This is not to give Lampard a free pass for Monday\u2019s drubbing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He was visibly shocked by events; those who have seen Everton concede five goals or more in a game eight times over the past five seasons, less so. He attributed the 5-0 loss to individual errors and bad defending. Both are long-term failings. No Premier League team have conceded more own goals than Everton\u2019s four this season or made more errors leading to a goal than their eight.  But a gameplan that exposed a weak Everton defence to Spurs\u2019 well-honed counterattack and failed to yield a shot on target for the second away game in succession, also contributed to an 11th consecutive Premier League trip without a win. \u201cEvery gameplan we\u2019ve had has been right and that comes from the manager and his staff preparing us well. I\u2019m not just saying that, it\u2019s really my opinion,\u201d Gordon says. \u201cBut as players I feel we\u2019ve let him and the staff down by losing our heads a bit and going away from the gameplan when things get tough.\u201d The 21-year-old is as spirited and impressive when interviewed as he has been on the pitch during a breakthrough season at Everton. Having grown up in Kirkdale, close to Goodison, he is acutely aware of the criticism that followed the heavy defeat at Spurs. \u201cI can totally understand why people might think we don\u2019t care but football is our life,\u201d he says. \u201cWe give everything to it. If you look at it from that perspective, it\u2019s stupid to think a player doesn\u2019t care. \u201cWe are in here day in, day out. We eat right, we sleep right, we give our lives to it. Everyone here cares. It\u2019s a massive deal and we\u2019re striving together. It\u2019s a difficult period, but tough times bring out the best in people.\u201d  Does he not worry that this tough period will end in relegation? \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cBecause I see how good we can be. And it\u2019s really annoying. To see us not do that week in, week out is really disappointing but I know we can do it, so I don\u2019t have any worry. If we just get certain things right then all the worry will disappear.\u201d"

                    "body": "Thomas Tuchel accepts Chelsea are in for a \u201cvery, very demanding summer\u201d regardless of how the club\u2019s ownership situation plays out, but says he is committed to staying at the club and putting them back on the front foot.\nIt has been nigh-on impossible for Tuchel to make active moves in the transfer market while Chelsea remain up for sale and, even if a deal was concluded imminently, there would be ground to make up in pursuing targets. That is doubly inconvenient given the key defender Antonio R\u00fcdiger has announced he will leave and another centre-back, Andreas Christensen, is also likely to depart. Tuchel was asked, with reference to Ralf Rangnick\u2019s recent remark that Manchester United require \u201copen-heart surgery\u201d, about the kind of work his side must undergo and said he faced a complicated task.\n\n\u201cCosmetic surgery,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cI would be less concerned if we still had the same ownership, if we could rely on our structure. As this is in question we are aware of the danger that the situation is maybe a bit more complex. And it can be complex enough if you lose a player like Toni, and maybe lose another like Andreas, both of them free. It is demanding nowadays in football to lose this kind of quality, even if everything else stays in place. So with this in question it can be a very, very demanding summer.\u201d\nTuchel, whose side face United on Thursday and hope for Chelsea\u2019s first win at Old Trafford since May 2013, admitted he was behind schedule in lining up recruits for next season.\n\u201cYou\u2019re never fully sure, but we would have some targets and we would for sure have contacted some players and found out about their situations,\u201d he said. \u201cNow our hands are tied: we can still have the talks inside the building but we cannot act.\n\n\u201cThe situation is not ideal. It would be challenging enough with a stable situation. We don\u2019t have that so everyone is doing it for the first time. And we try to show our commitment, our passion, for it and maybe it is very important for me to give this message: I\u2019m committed, I\u2019m looking forward to it and I\u2019m passionate about it. And as soon as we can act we will try to turn things around and make it, from a disadvantage, maybe an advantage.\u201d\nR\u00fcdiger and Reece James have returned to training before the visit to United, where Tuchel will face an old mentor in Rangnick, and Chelsea hope Christensen will have recovered from a sickness issue. All three players missed Sunday\u2019s win over West Ham."

                    "body": "  7.15pm    Here\u2019s Ewan Murray\u2019s report from Dublin.       7.14pm    The Scotland captain, Andy Robertson, speaks to Premier Sports.   Nowhere near good enough, we have now said that twice in ten days, not good enough. We have let the manager down. Every one of lost our individual battles, the second balls going to them. The fans booing us off were completely correct. We know they spend a lot of money. We have to sit the reset button, this year the performances haven\u2019t been up to scratch.       7.00pm    The socials are in.        6.53pm   Full-time: Ireland 3-0 Scotland  That could hardly have gone better for the Bossman Steo. His team fizzed with energy, just as the best Ireland teams do. They ruled midfield, and Nathan Collins and Shane Duffy did very well in defence, with goalscorer Alan Browne outstanding on the flank. Those two strikers, Obafemi and Parrott looked to strike up an understanding, and both scored from passes to the other. And at last, Ireland have won a Nations League game. Scotland were hopeless, too, but feel the quality of that Obafemi goal for Ireland\u2019s third.   Updated at 6.55pm BST    6.52pm    90+4 min: Cheers as Obafemi is named man of the match to loud cheers, though there were plenty of other contenders.      6.48pm    90+4 min: Four minutes added on, four minutes to savour for Ireland.      6.47pm    89 min: Of a series of hopeless Scotland free-kicks, Billy Gilmour\u2019s takes the cake. He clanks it out for a throw-in on the other side.      6.46pm    88 min: All those subs have taken something of the sting out, and Ireland are on a victory lap, one Stephen Kenny is bound to enjoy. Robinson is meanwhile booked for crashing into Stuart Armstrong. It looked nasty, and the Saints player gets treatment off the field.      6.44pm    86 min: The attendance announced, and it\u2019s just under 47,000. Not bad, and a famous night for all those who went along. Grant Hanley is jeered for hoofing the ball out of play. It\u2019s not been a good evening for him, or Ireland.      6.43pm    84 min: Two more Ireland subs, off go Molumby, who played well, and on comes Hendrick. Parrott goes off, crossing himself, the goalscorer, and on comes Callum Robinson.      6.40pm    81 min: Parrott took a whack from McTominay. Worries for the Bossman, as his star strike force may be missing in Poland if that\u2019s a bad one. Parrott soldiers on, with Obafemi likely to be missing. This, by the way, would Ireland first competitive win in three years, the last coming against Gibraltar.      6.38pm    79 min: Ireland have a chance to get the ball launched into the Scotland box but then take it slow, choosing to have what they hold. Scotland look like they would rather be anywhere but here. Oh well, there\u2019s always Armenia on Tuesday.      6.35pm    77 min: Scotland have a corner, Kelleher having been unable to keep the ball in, then Duffy wins the ball ahead of Hanley, it\u2019s not a fair fight in the air.      6.33pm    75 min: Armstrong escapes from Collins down the wing, and then whips in a cross. Stewart was unmarked but he wasn\u2019t ever going to get to that cross.      6.30pm    74 min: Simon McMahon gets in touch: \u201cHello John. I\u2019ve not seen any of the game, just the score, but as we say up here this is a minter for Scotland. Embarrassing. An absolutely shocking result. Whisky here I come. Though it would appear some of the Scotland players might have beaten me to it.\u201dThey\u2019ve been shocking right enough. Off goes McKenna, who looked to have a knock, and on comes John Souttar to partner Grant Hanley.   Updated at 6.31pm BST    6.29pm    72 min: Ireland make a change. Jason Knight goes off, having played very well in midfield and on comes Conor Hourihane, the free agent who left Aston Villa yesterday.      6.28pm    70 min: Kieran Coughlan gets in touch: \u201cBoss Man Threeo.\u201d Very good.      6.27pm    69 min: Gordon has to stop a Parrott cross that was heading right for Hogan. It\u2019s all Ireland.      6.26pm    68 min: Collins again steps forward and plays in Parrott, who almost sets away an overload down the left, his pass just letting the side down. Scotland, again, all over the show. Then Scott Hogan chases Scott McKenna into distraction. Hogan has really put himself about since replacing Obafemi.      6.24pm    66 min: Stuart, perhaps a Caledonian gentleman, gets in touch: \u201cHa, well, we don\u2019t even care about this silly competition anyway, so there !!!\u201d   Updated at 6.27pm BST    6.23pm    65 min: Hogan chases down the ball when it\u2019s played back to Gordon and to huge cheers from the home fans. Ireland believe in their team and the fans are cheering on every last chase and hustle.      6.22pm    64 min: How did Hanley keep that out? Amazing. Meanwhile, he is put through his paces by Duffy on another corner. Scotland are being bested in all departments here. Ireland continue to flush with confidence.      6.21pm    62 min: Ireland almost score again, Hogan climbing highest, and then the ball is cleared off the line by Hanley. It looks over, and the goalline tech seems to have missed it. The ref asks for a check, as instructed by the VAR. It\u2019s not given, it must have been so so tight.      6.19pm    60 min: Steve Clarke really not happy, then. Those are three of his most influential players, and he\u2019s either had enough, or resting them for the next game.      6.18pm    59 min: Three Scotland changes: off go McGinn, on comes Armstrong. Off goes Adams, on comes Stewart, off goes Christie, on comes Brown.      6.15pm    57 min: Suddenly Parrott has lots of space, but then Gilmour smashes through the back of him. No foul, apparently.      6.14pm    56 min: Steve Clarke unamused on the sidelines. And it looks like the show is over for Obafemi, who looks to have pulled his groin muscle, perhaps in the act of thrashing the ball home. He\u2019s roared off the field as he goes. One goal, another assist, what a fine first start for your country. On comes Scott Hogan instead.      6.11pm    52 min: As a friend just remarked, it you want to think of a goal like that, then Didier Drogba\u2019s classic v Everton is the one it reminds of. Full marks for Molumby and Browne for forcing the ball out for Obafemi to do the rest.      6.09pm   Goal! Ireland 3-0 Scotland (Obafemi, 51)  Ireland seem a little circumspect, by contrast to what came in the first half. They are perhaps waiting to send their speedy front two away...hang on, what\u2019s this, the ball drops to Obafemi after Gilmour is robbed and the striker smashes a shot past Gordon and in, his first for his country, a screamer. Oh Ireland! Oh yes! Oh Steo!   Updated at 6.22pm BST    6.06pm    48 min: Duffy climbs highest to clear the header. As will always be expected.      6.06pm    47 min: Scotland zipping around with the greater intent. a mirror of what happened with Ireland in the first half. Robertson speeds along down the flank, past Browne, and Duffy has to come across to knock behind.   Updated at 6.07pm BST    6.04pm    46 min: Ireland take quite a while over a throw-in. Timewasting already? Seems a bit risky and unnecessary.      6.03pm    We\u2019re back underway and birthday boy Billy Gilmour has replaced Jack Hendry, as Steve Clarke adds ballast to the midfield where Jasons Knight and Molumby had been doing very well for Ireland.      6.01pm    JR in Illinois gets in touch: \u201cAfter the FAI \u201csuccession\u201d plan elevated Kenny to manager he declined to bring Obafemi back into the squad. I believe his reasoning had something to do with Obafemi \u2018s playing style not fitting with the way Kenny wanted to line up the team. I seem to remember calling BS at the time and I think most people were surprised Obafemi was being left out. That decision isn\u2019t looking the very best right now. What has Kenny changed that allows Obafemi to fit in now?\u201d Before the game, the Bossman was talking of how now that Obafemi is getting a game at Swansea and scoring goals then he has to be given a chance. It seems to be working out today, his first start, but yes, hard not to wonder why he wasn\u2019t trusted before.      5.48pm   Half-time: Ireland 2-0 Scotland  Ireland have been excellent, dangerous in possession and in the air, while Scotland have been squeezed to distraction. They have only looked dangerous whenever Ireland choose to pass the ball around the back at goal kicks. In his 25th match in charge, Stephen Kenny is halfway to a famous victory.      5.47pm    45 min: Steve Clarke can be heard urging on his players. Che Adams, the lone striker, has had a tough time of it. Just a minute added of a breathless half. It concludes with a free-kick to Scotland, McGinn whips it from the wing, and then Obafemi tries to make another escape. Ireland so dangerous on the break with his and Troy Parrott\u2019s pace. That\u2019s the final action of the half.      5.44pm    43 min: Scotland create an overload down the left, but Browne, who has had a fine game, cuts out the Robertson cross. When Ireland break quickly from the corner, though Knight, he is fouled by Christie who takes the booking. Without it, Knight was away.      5.42pm    42 min: James McClean dishes out a typical tackle on Ralston and then goes and apologises for his zest.      5.41pm    40 min: Robertson clatters Browne, lucky to be not pulled up for a foul. Scotland play on, and force a corner. Christie takes, Kelleher punches clear. Scotland pushed back as they try to find a way back into the game. Robertson makes a hash of a cross and is jeered by the home fans for it.      5.39pm    39 min: Ireland have been really good. This must be the best they have played under Stephen Kenny.      5.38pm    38 min: Knight surges on, his shot deflected off for a corner. McClean takes, Duffy the target and he heads down and Collins knocks behind. It could have been three; Duffy has the beating of McKenna in the air. Then comes in another, and Hanley has to stop Duffy, the dreadnought Scotland cannot deal with. The pressure is only released when Gordon is ruled to have been fouled by Obafemi, Scotland all at sea under the bombardment.      5.35pm    35 min: Josh Reynolds gets in touch: \u201cNathan Collins was a great player for us at Stoke and it\u2019s a real pleasure to see him getting on so well.\u201d He really does look the part.      5.34pm    33 min: Collins does well, taking the ball from Adams, Scotland\u2019s attackers really struggling to get much time to create anything. Still, McTominay has chance to boom in a corner, and Duffy climbs highest. The ball comes out to McGregor who shanks it out.     5.32pm    31 min: Scotland look stunned. Both Ireland goals came not long after McGinn should probably have scored for them. Steve Clarke looks even more dour than usual.      5.30pm    29 min: Obafemi and Parrott linking so well for that goal, and suddenly Ireland\u2019s future under the Bossman Steo looks very bright indeed.      5.29pm   Goal! Ireland 2-0 Scotland (Parrott, 28)  Wow, two Ireland goals. Obafemi controls the ball, pivots and chips it through for Parrott to score. That was a beautiful goal.    Updated at 5.32pm BST    5.28pm    27 min: Ireland try to play out again. Shane Duffy caught out again, and John McGinn again missing. Why do they keep doing this? Duffy can be a fine player, but he is not suited to that.      5.27pm    26 min: Dreadful corner from McTominay, it goes out to the other side bouncing once.      5.26pm    25 min: Scotland try to get back into it, passing the ball patiently to boos from those in green in the stands. Browne steps across to head a Ralston corner behind.      5.25pm    23 min: Good run from Collins causes problems for Scotland. Ireland have played well here. Scotland have been discomfited. Nathan Collins looks a great prospect. And probably won\u2019t be playing for Burnley in the Championship next season.      5.23pm    21 min: It looked to have come off Browne\u2019s hip, and in, the Preston man never actually in control of the ball. It won\u2019t be an entry in 101 Great Goals but they all count, and Stephen Kenny\u2019s team find a goal for the first time in this Nations League tranche.      5.21pm   Goal! Ireland 1-0 Scotland (Browne, 20)  McClean curls in from the flank, Obafemi stoops to nod in, only for Scott Mckenna\u2019s header to direct it off. Then comes the corner. McClean takes, Duffy nods back across goal and Browne walks the ball into the net.    Updated at 5.37pm BST    5.19pm    17 min: Paul Van Salle gets in touch: \u201cFor Scotland, Grant Hanley and Scott McTominay come in for John Souttar and Stuart Armstrong, ahead of Billy Gilmour. A glance at social media suggests this is not a popular selection, though Gilmour\u2019s fitness is perhaps a little lacking. \u201cJohn, It\u2019s Billy\u2019s 21st birthday!. Presumably the manager didn\u2019t want to spoil his fun weekend by making him run around . . .\u201dHappy birthday, wee Billy, keys to the door.       5.17pm    16 min: Josh Cullen plays in Parrott, then Browne gallops on and has a shot blocked before Ireland pass it around. On the sideline, the Bossman can be heard urging his players to take on their opponent.      5.15pm    14 min: Ireland are determined to play from the back, and it\u2019s setting a few hearts a-flutter among their fans.      5.14pm    12 min: A first real attack for Scotland, with Ryan Christie at its epicentre, and Ralston is sent down the flanks, pinging in a cross that\u2019s cleared away, though the space had been left gaping. Ireland were opened up rather easily. Robertson charges in and Browne blocks him...then Ireland make a horrible mess and John McGinn might have done better. Kelleher and Duffy played the ball out from the back and should have been punished.      5.11pm    10 min: Michael Obafemi is running around an awful lot, pressing from the front. The ball goes to McClean who wafts a cross out from the line. That was a waste.      5.09pm    8 min: After that start, it\u2019s slowed down a little. That may worry Stephen Kenny, as much the same happened against Ukraine.      5.08pm    6 min: Scotland try to get their breath back, as John Egan tries to get Troy Parrott away. There\u2019s not much space out there. All very squeezed with Jason Knight adding numbers to the midfield for Ireland.      5.05pm    4 min: Gordon makes a fine low save as Browne fires in a shot. Ireland have begun with real zest. Shane Duffy has loped forward to get involved, with Scotland pinned back.      5.04pm    3 min: McTominay does come back on, if a tad gingerly though he gets involved in a midfield stramash. He\u2019ll be OK. The pace is already high, the ball seems to be bouncing around a bit.      5.02pm    1 min: And away we go in Ireland. Jason Knight seems to have tucked into midfield, and then loses the ball and clatters into Scott McTominay, who seems in serious pain. That looks nasty, his ankle seemed to turn.    Updated at 5.16pm BST    4.58pm    Flower of Scotland rings out, followed by Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann. Loud roars follow both.      4.55pm    The players emerge at a sold-out Aviva Stadium, the Tartan Army have travelled in numbers. The Premier Sports commentator talks of \u201ckilts swimming in the Dublin streets\u201d. An enduring image.      4.53pm    Steve Clarke speaks to Premier Sports.   It\u2019s just about getting back on the bike and going again. Now we look forward to another tough game, should be a great atmosphere and both teams should feed off that. [On team selection] Normal rotation, and try to have a little bit of continuity. Ee have developed a strong squad. [Ireland] are going to work hard, and put you under pressure, tough game.       4.45pm    Stephen Kenny speaks to Premier Sports.   It\u2019s such a quick turnaround, we\u2019ve refreshed with the five changes. We are disappointed, we were on a good run, one defeat in 12, and we have managed to lose both games without conceding a chance in either game. We had had a lot of the play but we haven\u2019t used the possession. It\u2019s a big test, we know Scotland have had a good time, a lot of players playing at the top of the Premier League. If we were to beat Scotland it would be the biggest result here in this stadium in seven years. We are up against it, Scotland have a formidable line up and we have to be at out best.   In his RTE interview, he uses much the same line that the last team, other than Qatar, the Irish beat who were higher than them in the Fifa rankings was Bosnia seven years ago.      4.19pm    To top this second-tier group, Scotland will have to top Ukraine, who have beaten Armenia this afternoon when playing their home match in Poland.       4.17pm    How did it go last time out for these two teams? Not well for Ireland.   Better for Scotland.       4.13pm    What does that mean? James McClean gets his 93rd cap, and that surely means he is going for 100 caps. The Bossman has made sweeping changes, with a youthful attacking lineup of Troy Parrott, Michael Obafemi and Jason Knight. Jason Molumby, now of West Brom after his loan there from Brighton, steps into midfield. For Scotland, Grant Hanley and Scott McTominay come in for John Souttar and Stuart Armstrong, ahead of Billy Gilmour. A glance at social media suggests this is not a popular selection, though Gilmour\u2019s fitness is perhaps a little lacking.  Anyway, Grant Hanley gives us opportunity to retool this classic from Birkenhead\u2019s finest.    Updated at 4.24pm BST    3.59pm   Here are the teams  Scotland: Gordon, Hendry, Hanley, McKenna, Ralston, McTominay, McGregor, Robertson, McGinn, Christie, Adams. Subs: McCrorie, Kelly, Patterson, Souttar, Stewart, Gilmour, Taylor, Armstrong, Turnbull, Brown, Campbell, Hickey. Ireland: Kelleher, N Collins, Duffy, Egan, McClean, Browne, Cullen, Molumby, Parrott, Obafemi, Knight. Subs: O\u2019Leary, Travers, Christie, Stevens, Robinson, Hourihane, Keane, Hendrick, O\u2019Shea, Hogan, Hamilton, Lenihan.       3.55pm   Preamble  Bloody hell, the football\u2019s still on. The Nations League continues with this battle of Celtic soul brothers, and there\u2019s a little riding on it, namely the credibility of Stephen Kenny, Ireland\u2019s manager, the Bossman Steo to those in the know, the Lossman Steo for those beginning to think that Ireland\u2019s footballing cultural revolution has stalled. Losing to Ukraine\u2019s second team on Wednesday was not much fun, and neither was the defeat in Armenia that preceded that. Scoring goals is a sincere problem, as is creativity in midfield. And there are those who wonder why the likes of Cyrus Christie and James McClean are still getting a runout.  At present, there\u2019s far less pressure on Steve Clarke, the Caledonian manager, but Scotland are licking their wounds from their own defeat to Ukraine, in that playoff for a playoff that cost them a place in Qatar this November. A semblance of pride was saved by the midweek win over Armenia.  The last time these teams met was in 2015, a 1-1 draw in Dublin, and it was a dreadful game. Despite their geographical proximity they\u2019ve met only eleven times, with four wins each. Two teams with similar ambitions, similar problems but Scotland having been rather more successful of late.Oh yeah, and there\u2019s Nations League points on the board in Group E, where Scotland head the table. Ireland are still yet to win a single Nations League match in its three iterations so far. Oh Steo.  Kickoff is at 5pm. Join me.   "

                    "body": "New South Wales Liberal senator Hollie Hughes justified claiming a taxpayer-funded travel allowance for Melbourne Cup day by saying the alcohol company that gave her a spot in its marquee had employees in her home state, making her attendance parliamentary business. Hughes billed taxpayers for a short trip to Melbourne in 2019, during which Victorian brewery Furphy, owned by alcohol giant Lion, treated her to an $800 spot in its Flemington marquee on Melbourne Cup day. The NSW senator had no other official engagements that day in Melbourne, but did have meetings and media engagements in Melbourne either side of race day, which justified the trip and her expense claim as predominantly for parliamentary business.  Freedom of information documents show that the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority began investigating Hughes\u2019s expense claims after reporting in the Guardian. She was asked to explain why she claimed the travel allowance, which was about $392 for the day of the Melbourne Cup. Hughes told the watchdog that Furphy was associated with Tooheys, also a Lion brand, which was a \u201cmajor employer in my state\u201d. \u201cI was hosted as a Senator for NSW by Furphys at the Melbourne Cup, owners of Tooheys. A major employer in my state of NSW,\u201d she wrote to Ipea. Hughes told the watchdog she had visited one of the company\u2019s factories at a later date, which was \u201can extension of the working relationship with the organisation\u201d. \u201cThis [the relationship] included working with them throughout the Covid lockdown and the NSW State Government to avoid the factory closure during lockdown,\u201d she wrote. Furphy is a Geelong brewery.  Ipea accepted the explanation and said the case warranted no further investigation. But it also told the senator that she would need to be prepared to publicly justify her claim. \u201cIPEA further notes that while such an event might appear to have personal benefit to some in the Australian community, in the principles-based scheme it is the responsibility of the parliamentarian to be prepared to publicly justify for their use of public resources for conduction [sic] their parliamentary business,\u201d the watchdog wrote. The Guardian asked Hughes whether she stood by her claim that her attendance was linked to her parliamentary work because Lion had employees in her state. On Friday, her office asked for more time to respond due to the fact the senator was \u201ccurrently very ill with Covid\u201d. She appeared for an in-person interview with Sky News at the channel\u2019s Sydney studio two days later, on 10 April.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   NSW Covid rules require positive cases to isolate for seven days. Those who test positive also must wait a further 24 hours if they are experiencing a sore throat, runny nose, cough, or shortness of breath before ending isolation. A spokesperson said the senator had begun isolation on 2 April, a day after she appeared in parliament, until 9 April. The senator then finished her isolation the day prior to the Sky News interview, and returned a negative rapid test on the day of the interview. \u201cSenator Hughes tested positive for Covid on Saturday 2 April. She isolated at home from 2 April to 9 April and had a negative RAT on Sunday 10 April,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cSenator Hughes did not have a sore throat, runny nose, cough or shortness of breath in the last 24 hours of her isolation period.\u201d The spokesperson did not respond to further questions about the Melbourne Cup travel allowance claim."

                    "body": "\u2018I still use my 2007 iPod Classic\u2019  When the incredible but short-lived iPod Mini was released in 2004, it wasn\u2019t available in the UK at first. I had to ask friends in Florida to bring one over for my son\u2019s 12th birthday. He loved showing his friends this device that looked like it belonged in the future. Our family has had plenty of iPods over the years; an early iPod with a click wheel, a mini, three Nanos, two Shuffles, and a Classic. My wife still takes her 2007 \u201cfat iPod nano\u201d on holiday as she doesn\u2019t like taking her iPhone to the pool. As a music player, an iPod has none of the potential distractions of a phone. No emails, no messages, and no notifications. It\u2019s a shame there will be no more iPods as there\u2019s still a place for a distraction-free music player. My 2007 black iPhone Classic is still permanently attached to the hi-fi in my car. It\u2019s a 160Gb model and contains my entire music collection \u2013 ripped from CDs \u2013 as it was a few years ago. The battery doesn\u2019t last, but that doesn\u2019t matter as it\u2019s constantly connected to USB power in my car. Andy Clarke, software designer, Wales, UK  \u2018A museum might want it one day\u2019  I bought my first iPod in 2004 in Singapore. It was a 40GB iPod and came with so many accessories \u2013 a docking port charger, headphones, a protective carry case, you name it. I had all my music digitised and on my iPod \u2013 it was so easy back then. The wheel on the original iPods used to drive me a bit crazy as it was sensitive to the slightest touch; you\u2019d try to move forwards on a playlist and you\u2019d skip too many songs, so you\u2019d try to go back but would go too far the other way. I still have my first iPod, and it still worked the last time I tried it. The biggest problem I have is finding a charger as Apple have changed them so many times. Sadly, I got rid of my docking port \u2013 more fool me. But I won\u2019t get rid of the iPod as it works and a museum might want it one day. I still use my iPod Shuffle \u2013 it\u2019s so much easier at the gym than a phone. I use my phone everywhere else, but I\u2019ve found quite a lot of what I listen to is not available on Spotify. I\u2019m sorry to see the iPod go simply because I can\u2019t afford what Apple charge for an iPhone with memory large enough to get all of my music and playlists on to. Elizabeth Dennett, 58, New Zealand  \u2018This was my format\u2019 The iPod arrived in that teenage sweet spot where music is everything. In the same way people venerate vinyl now, this was my format. I\u2019d load up on CDs at Selectadisc in Nottingham, rip them to iTunes, shelve them and mooch off into college or town with the latest stuff blasting out. It\u2019s the device on which I formed memories with Radiohead, Wilco, REM, Bloc Party, Blur, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, Beck, Gorillaz and loads of other bands that now seem really ancient. Shuffle was there for the quick five-minute blast between lessons or work shifts where you just needed to fill your brain with music, but I was almost always a snob about listening to albums from back to front. And always dreamed of someone picking up my iPod and commenting on how great my music taste was and asking me to marry them. Times change and it\u2019s a miracle to have essentially every song streamable in my pocket, with wireless headphones. But I\u2019m also an old git now with responsibilities \u2013 and I miss the iPod days. Nothing will quite touch that feeling of powering around town filling my brain with endless new music on a distraction-free, dedicated, insanely cool, easy-to-use piece of overpriced tech that wasn\u2019t also a portal to social media hell. Matt, 33, reporter, Nottingham, UK  \u2018I\u2019m surprisingly heavy-hearted about it\u2019  In the second week of January 2005 my father took me to John Lewis in Reading for the sole purpose of trying to find the elusive fourth generation 40 GB model. It had sold out everywhere before Christmas and I was desperate to finally get my first ever iPod. I\u2019d been using a CD Walkman for years, but the iPod was tiny (for the time), sleek, intuitive to use, and looked like one of those futuristic devices from a 50s sci-fi comic. It went everywhere with me \u2013 carrying songs ripped from all my parents\u2019 CDs; Queen, Erik Satie, Bob Dylan, Weezer, the Rocky soundtrack, and eventually thousands of other tracks ripped from friends\u2019 computers using a rather cheeky piece of free software called MyTunes Redux.  The following year, it got crushed in a bike accident, but I woke up in hospital with it still playing next to me, screen cracked and the body split down the seam \u2013 my first taste of heartbreak. Seventeen years later, I still can\u2019t bring myself to throw the old 40GB away, so I use it to store camera memory cards in the cable drawer. I\u2019m surprisingly heavy-hearted about it, and probably feel very similar to how people felt when the original Game Boy was discontinued in 2003, which marked the end of an era for iconic gaming devices. When the news broke about Apple dropping it, I admit, I went straight to the site and ordered a new Touch to keep in the cable drawer as back-up for when my ageing iPod Video finally calls it a day. I\u2019m just not ready to switch systems. Alexander Lerche, 34, photojournalist, Doha, Qatar  \u2018I remember the thrill of opening the box\u2019  I first saw an iPod in a client\u2019s office in 2002. I was totally smitten. My wife bought me my first iPod (20GB) for Christmas that year. It took me an entire weekend to upload all my CDs into iTunes to transfer to the iPod. Having lugged about cases of LPs as a teenager, I couldn\u2019t believe I had all my music in my pocket, available to play at will. I remember the thrill of opening the box \u2013 beautiful, smooth cardboard with the strap line \u201cDesigned in California\u201d. And then the gorgeous white iPod, which felt so good in the palm of my hand. I also remember paying a small fortune to have a car kit installed so I could play anything from my music collection while driving. When I first took my iPod to the beach, I enclosed it in a waterproof, shockproof case \u2013 I was paranoid about not damaging it in any way. The iPod was a real breakthrough, and thanks to technology I can now listen to anything at anytime via my iPhone or MacBook. I no longer use mine now \u2013 the battery can\u2019t be charged. But I will always keep my original iPod. Nigel Wilson, 66, yoga teacher, Kent, UK  \u2018When I hear Eminem, the memories of the Shuffle come back\u2019 My dad went to the States in 2004 and came back with a third generation iPod for my brother and I was outraged. He wasn\u2019t ever kind enough to lend it to me, but instead I would steal his spare set of headphones and just put the plug end into my pocket so I would look cool going to school. I had a friend around that same time and she had an iPod Shuffle which she was kind enough to lend, and I recall her love for Eminem. Even to this day, when I hear Eminem the memories of that Shuffle come back. When I eventually got my own third gen in 2006 I started to really find my own music taste for the first time. I used to spend hours uploading music from CDs and making sure every song had all the info perfectly recorded so I could handpick each one and put it cleanly into its appropriate playlist. I made lifelong friends in those early days as we swapped music and bonded over certain songs or artists. I still have all the music I ever loaded on to it on a special hard drive at home. My first album was Aladdin, the soundtrack. Susie Krieble, 30, project manager, Tokyo, Japan"

                    "body": "  5.08pm    And here\u2019s the match report.       5.06pm    Rangers goalscorer Scott Arfield spoke to Premier Sports.   It feels really good. It\u2019s been a long time coming since we\u2019ve been in this position. That was one hurdle that we\u2019ve got over and there\u2019s another one on 21 May. We\u2019re delighted to be there. Thankfully, Kemar Roofe took a bad touch and I got the goal, so lovely. This morning my sister-in-law lost her papa. He was a big Rangers man. I want to dedicate that to her side of the family. We\u2019re all extremely excited for meeting Hearts in the final. We won\u2019t underestimate them.      4.47pm    The emails are in.  First, Robert Speed: \u201cWhat this game really needs is a long VAR review of that goal, with it being disallowed of course for a toenail offside\u201d  Second, J Graham, possibly not a Rangers fan: \u201c Bobby Madden deserves a medal for his efforts on behalf of Rangers today, shocking display of refereeing.\u201d  Updated at 5.12pm BST    4.46pm    John Lundstram celebrates Rangers\u2019 first final since 2016, they last won the trophy in 2011. He speaks to Premier Sports, with Ryan Kent shouting \u201cwell done, la\u2019\u201d as he does so.   It feels unbelievable to be fair, it\u2019s been a long time coming for the club. We done ourselves proud to come back and show real character. It\u2019s so tough to play 120 min back to back. Ryan Kent I thought was unbelievable. I am so tired but it\u2019s all worth it in the end. I am ecstatic to be the final, that\u2019s what I cam here for, to win trophies with this great club.       4.41pm    Celtic fans - and Chris Sutton in the Premier Sports coverage - may bemoan the performance of referee Bobby Madden but Ange Postecoglou chose to shake hands with him after the final whistle. He\u2019s a good bloke, is Ange. Hard but fair, mate.      4.39pm    What was the key moment? It has to be Cameron Carter-Vickers\u2019 miss from close range when Celtic were 1-0 up and Rangers were rocking. Ange Postecoglou may rue that one for years.        4.35pm   Full time: Celtic 1-2 Rangers (aet)  Fashion Sakala\u2019s goal decided it after Scott Arfield pulled Rangers back into it in levelling Greg Taylor\u2019s opening. It is Rangers who can still take a treble, and that\u2019s Celtic\u2019s hopes of a domestic treble at an end. Braga and Celtic in the space of three days over 240 minutes for Rangers and Gio van Bronckhorst, as Hearts await in the final. What a game, what a week for Rangers.    Updated at 4.47pm BST    4.33pm    120+3 min: O\u2019Riley rages as he is penalised for a foul on Kamara. It\u2019s all ticking away for Celtic. McLaughlin takes his time over a free-kick.      4.31pm    120+2 min: Celtic struggling to build an attack of any note. Rangers have done a number on them here.     4.30pm    12o min: Four minutes added on, and Big Ange looks worried. That 33-match unbeaten run is nearing its end.      4.30pm    119 min: Arfield, using all his experience, buys a foul. Sakala contributes to the timewasting effort by going down, too.      4.28pm    118 min: Bobby Madden, the ref, pulls the ball back when David Turnbull tries to take a free-kick, and he gives the decision to Rangers. Not popular, the man in black today, especially with those in green.      4.26pm    116 min: He\u2019s in Fashion, as Brett Anderson might say. What an effective substitution by Gio, and the noise from the Rangers end is huge. Bouncy bouncy bouncy and all that. What a week it\u2019s shaping up to be for them.      4.25pm   Goal! Celtic 1-2 Rangers (Sakala, 115)  Ryan Kent speeds into the Celtic half, releases Bassey, and his cross comes off Sekala, and then perhaps off Carter-Vickers but it\u2019s in. And Rangers have the lead. It came off Starfelt, in fact.     Updated at 4.49pm BST    4.23pm    113 min: Bassey plays in Sakala round the back but his cross dribbles into the arms of Hart. Rangers stepping it up now.   Updated at 4.28pm BST    4.21pm    111 min: Not much play in this half of extra time. Lots of standing around and subs. But too soon, a thrilling piece of play from Arfield, Hart makes two saves, first from Arfield, and then from Tavernier, off the post and Carter-Vickers chucks his head in the way. Desperate defensive work from Celtic. They only just got away with it.      4.18pm    108 min: Barasic sits down, he can take no further part, and Balogun will come in his stead. David Turnbull will come on for Celtic too. Roofe also off for Rangers as Fashion Sakala comes on. Turnill replaces Hatate.   Updated at 4.28pm BST    4.16pm    106 min: We go again once more. Some tired legs and minds out there. Rod Stewart\u2019s in the stands and he also looks a bit tired.      4.12pm    105 min: That\u2019s it for the first half of extra time. Are Rangers hanging on for penalties? Jota, cutting in from the left, and shooting with his right, almost made them score another to reach spot kicks. Then Rangers get a free-kick, one that Celtic clear, with Glen Kamara having his shot stopped. There\u2019s 15 more minutes to decide it.     4.09pm    104 min: Ralston forces a Celtic corner, that\u2019s taken short and Kent spots the danger and sweeps up to clear the danger for Rangers.      4.07pm    102 min: Celtic have been the better team in extra time, Rangers at last looking tired. Gio changes it up, taking off John Lundstram for Glen Kamara.      4.05pm    100 min: McGregor releases Jota, who has his shot blocked by Tavernier, and then the Gers captain gets in front of Hatete. Desperate defending called for by desperate measures as we get desperately close to any mistake being crucial.      4.03pm    98 min: Celtic waste their free-kick, Jota playing the ball to O\u2019Riley to have his shot blocked.      4.02pm    97 min: Wright\u2019s slipped pass finds Roofe, who is one on one with Hart, who gets there first. A weak penalty claim is denied. Then up the other end, Barasic handles the ball, just beyond the edge of the Rangers box.      4.00pm    95 min: Celtic look tired. What was Big Ange doing to them during that training camp? Kyogo escapes the Rangers offside trap and then takes too much time, and might have released a speeding James Forrest.   Updated at 4.01pm BST    3.58pm    93 min: Simon McMahon is back: \u201cWhatever happens, undoubtedly a fine advert for BritishIrish Scottish football.\u201d     3.57pm    92 min: Rangers look to continue their momentum of the latter stages of normal time but Ralston comes across to quell the danger.   Updated at 4.06pm BST    3.56pm    91 min: Celtic make two changes, with Taylor and Maeda off, and Welsh and Forrest on.      3.53pm   Full-time: Celtic 1-1 Rangers  That exchange of goals between Greg Taylor and Scott Arfield means bonus soccer. It\u2019s been great so far, and extra time, with penalties probable means we shall soon know who the heroes and villains are.      3.51pm    90+4 min: O\u2019Riley forces another corner, that McLaughlin gets punched clear. That\u2019s the last of it, and we have extra time.      3.50pm    90+3 min: Jota wins the ball back by the touchline, Kyogo wants it but can\u2019t receive it. Instead, Celtic have a corner.      3.48pm    90+2 min: Oh no, Ryan Kent saw glory and could only swing at fresh air. That was the one, perhaps. Instead, a foul on Barasic allows Rangers chance to get the ball into the box. But it\u2019s cleared by Carter-Vickers.      3.47pm    90 min: Barasic goes on the overlap as Rangers seek a late, famous winner. Four minutes to be added on. Celtic, looking the more tired, are hanging on a bit here.      3.46pm    89 min: Scott Wright and Arfield attempt to find a way through but Celtic find a way to clear before Davis comes on to a Kent pass and smashes over.      3.44pm    87 min: Maeda and Kyogo looking for opportunities up front, and from Jota\u2019s cross Kyogo heads down and wide.      3.42pm    85 min: Rangers look likelier though Joe Hart claims a Tavernier cross after Kent skips past Ralston. Then Goldson goes down, and looks to be in pain, and it seems a case of cramp.      3.40pm    83 min: Arfield has the ball in the net once more, but only after an offside flag had correctly caught out Ryan Kent.      3.39pm    82 min: Now, who has the nerve in this last ten minutes? It\u2019s getting scrappy. Though Goldson\u2019s passing from the back is beginning to open up space in the Celtic defence.      3.37pm    80 min: Tavernier and Goldson were the suppliers of that goal but Arfield\u2019s finish was expert, and Gio\u2019s substitutions had the desired effect. Anyone\u2019s game now, and McGregor, the masked man, smashed one from distance.      3.36pm   Goal! Celtic 1-1 Rangers (Arfield, 79)  Rangers really struggling to find their way back, though will surely get another chance or two...and sure enough they do. Arfield, coming off the left, comes on to a ball from Tavernier and whips it beyond Hart. Great finish from the sub. Game on.     Updated at 3.47pm BST    3.33pm    76 min: Joe Hart comes out to control the ball well out of his box. Calls for a handball, and denied. It wasn\u2019t though what Hart was doing out there may well be questioned.      3.31pm    75 min: Rangers make a couple of changes. Aribo off, Arfield on. Ryan Jack off, and Steven Davis comes on to make things interesting.      3.30pm    73 min: Goldson is booked for fouling Kyogo as the magic man seeks to pass the ball. Who will hit the free-kick from the edge of the box? Jota smashes off the top of the wall and behind.      3.29pm    71 min: Lundstram has a shot from distance, and it\u2019s nowhere near as good as his first-half effort against the post.     3.28pm    70 min: Rangers have been given a lifeline by that Carter-Vickers miss, now can they live again?      3.26pm    68 min: Celtic having most of the ball now. Rangers perhaps feeling the fatigue from Thursday....and Carter-Vickers from a knockdown, wallops the ball against the bar. Right from six yards out, he smashed it with his left. It has to go down as a bad, bad miss.      3.24pm    66 min: Celtic, having taken the lead, suffer a blow as Juranovic gets hurt, and on comes Ralston for him. Van Bronckhorsy does not look amused on the sidelines.      3.22pm   Goal! Celtic 1-0 Rangers (Taylor, 64)  Well well. Celtic take a quick free-kick, and and Taylor sees a chance to shoot and it comes off Bassey and beyond McLaughlin. The ball bounced all over the show there, and Celtic took advantage. The treble is on on on on.     Updated at 3.37pm BST    3.20pm    63 min: This time Lundstram escapes a booking for a combine harvester foul on McGregor. Bobby Madden, the referee, may want to cancel his plans for a driving his sponsored car with his name emblazoned on the side around the East End. If he was planning it, that is.   Updated at 3.23pm BST    3.19pm    61 min: Nice run by Wright but falls over as Rangers threaten to attack. Celtic have been the better team for a few minutes. Eventually, O\u2019Riley wafts a cross into the grateful palms of McLaughlin.      3.17pm    59 min: Seems to be asking a lot of Kyogo to conjure the win but they need something. He\u2019s almost immediately involved, before Lundstram, who has had a fine game, intercepts the ball before it comes to the Japanese forward\u2019s feet.      3.14pm    58 min: Off goes Abada, on come Kyogo and Matt O\u2019Riley. Tom Rogic has also left the field, having failed to impose himself.      3.13pm    57 min: Abada goes down for Celtic as Big Ange prepares to make some changes that include Kyogo coming on, and the sight of the magic man gets the Bhoys fans cheering.      3.12pm    55 min: In the crowd, there\u2019s gripes and groans, it\u2019s all getting very testy. Though there\u2019s some oohs as Ryan Kent cuts in smashes just wide.      3.11pm    54 min: Bassey bundles over Rogic, and Celtic\u2019s players are not happy. No booking. Somehow.    Updated at 3.24pm BST    3.10pm    53 min: Chance for Celtic. Hatate, possibly offside, shoots wide. That\u2019s as close as Celtic have come. The linesman was caught out there but there\u2019s no VAR.      3.09pm    51 min: Beginning to boil up now, all eyes on referee Bobby Madden. J Graham gets in touch: \u201cHow was there no option for Aribo other than fouling McGegor ? Shocking refereeing, stops play when Aribo hurts himself but misses the foul by Bassey on Juranovic and also fails to stop the game. Key decisions are being given to Rangers. Typical Jack tackle on Hatate right on halftime, hopefully he\u2019s able to come out for the second half.\u201d To answer: players are told to take the card if it stops a dangerous attack. I don\u2019t approve but that\u2019s the way of the world.      3.07pm    49 min: Roofe now booked for cropping Maeda. That was more cynical than a Jack Dee comedy set.      3.05pm    48 min: Joe Hart calls out to claim the ball from a free-kick, and then Lundstram tries to block off the goalkick. Hart, ever the diplomat, then steps in to stop Juranovic putting a flea in Lundstram\u2019s ear.      3.04pm    47 min: Some more smoke at the start of this half, though not as much as the first, which resembled a Serie A game from the 1990s.      3.02pm    46 min: No more changes at half-time after Scott Wright replaced Ramsey. We await the arrival of Kyogo. Rangers begin the half with a looping header from Roofe.      2.47pm   Half-time: Celtic 0-0 Rangers  The half closes out with Aribo heading wide, another chance for Rangers, who have been the better team but unable to find a goal. John Lundstram came closest so far but it\u2019s been tight and Rangers will have to do without Aaron Ramsey, who has limped off.      2.45pm    45 min: Wright gets involved quickly, and heads for the byline, only to be stopped by Starfelt\u2019s tackle. Then another booking as Ryan Jack is given one for pulling down Hatate. The Japanese player looks to have hurt his ankle there. Cards and knocks piling up as one minute is added for the half.      2.43pm    43 min: Aaron Ramsey is down, he\u2019s not looked himself all game. Scott Wright is set to come on, and the Welshman leaves the field to jeers from the Celtic fans. His fitness just hasn\u2019t been there to do enough for Rangers and he\u2019s feeling his hamstring as he heads down the Hampden tunnel.    Updated at 2.56pm BST    2.42pm    41 min: Lundstram smashes the ball of the post! Left foot and back out, as Carter-Vickers sets up a counter by stopping Ramsey getting the rebound and Celtic go down the other end. Eventually Hatate\u2019s shot dribbles wide.      2.40pm    40 min: Celtic rage as Juranovic is down and play is waved on, as Aribo smashes him. Then McGregor is booked, after a delay, for another of those tactical fouls.      2.38pm    38 min: Juranovic smashes one from long distance and it\u2019s no trouble for McLaughlin. Celtic are being reduced to the speculative stuff.      2.36pm    36 min: Aribo is booked for a tactical foul on a gallivanting McGregor. There was little option other than to hack him down, and that\u2019s the first yellow of the afternoon.      2.35pm    35 min: More Rangers attacking and more Celtic defending, with more relief when Joe Hart gets his hands back on the ball.      2.35pm    33 min: Relief for Joe Hart as Roofe and then Aribo get chance to aim free headers at him, both from close range. That comes after some loose play from Celtic\u2019s Starfelt.      2.32pm    32 min: Ooof! Lundstram clatters into McGregor, who spins into the air. Then Jota is clattered. Celtic can\u2019t make much of the free-kick, and are struggling to pose any threat to Rangers in attack.   Updated at 2.45pm BST    2.31pm    31 min: Another Rangers corner, and Tavernier whips it in, but Aribo can\u2019t get to it cleanly. In the stands, the singing continues to be raucous.      2.29pm    29 min: Rogic clips Roofe and Rangers have a free-kick in a dangerous position. Who fancies it? Ramsey is the answer and he smashes it over, a shot in keeping with his showing so far.      2.27pm    28 min: It\u2019s scrappy, nervy, tetchy. Yes, it\u2019s an Old Firm game all right, though the tinderbox is yet to be properly lit.      2.26pm    26 min: Simon McMahon gets in touch: \u201cHi John. Your post immediately prior to kick off about the flags on display at both ends is a good one, and will have been noted with interest by fans of all other clubs in Scotland, who tend to view the teams playing today with a mixture of amusement and contempt. Whilst watching every second, of course.\u201d     2.26pm    25 min: Nervy from McLaughlin in the Rangers goal, as he knocks behind. Celtic take the corner short again; they don\u2019t seem to trust their presence in the air so are trying to pass their way through.      2.23pm    23 min: Ramsey\u2019s touch is loose - again, the game is passing him by - and Maeda speeds away for Celtic. Rangers are grateful to only concede a corner, and they get that clear.      2.21pm    20 min: A nice Rangers move is broken up at the edge of Celtic box before Juranovic is forced to head behind when Tavernier spinnakers in a cross from the right. Rangers seem the likelier at the moment though Celtic clear the danger for now.      2.19pm    18 min: Settling down now after that explosive start? It seems so, and we are veering into the territory of an intriguing tactical battle. After the Braga game, Rangers probably need to conserve energy.      2.17pm    16 min: For Celtic, Maeda attempts a shot on goal that involves him spinning and backheeling. Real freestyle stuff, but useless in truth. The ball isn\u2019t sticking up front too much for Celtic.      2.14pm    14 min: Kent wins a corner for Rangers, and Celtic\u2019s set-piece mettle is tested before Roofe is penalised for smashing into Juranovic.      2.13pm    12 min: Tavernier forges up from defence on a typical overlap. Then Aribo has chance to force the issue but only manages to hit the first defender.      2.10pm    10 min: Ramsey gets in a good position but his first touch lets him down. He still looks very rusty in a Rangers shirt. At the other end, Jota finds space but shoots high and wide.      2.08pm    8 min: A masked McGregor is lucky not to be booked for smashing into Aribo. Well, it is the first ten minutes of an Old Firm. Then Roofe has a dig from distance but wide of Joe Hart\u2019s goal. It\u2019s an open affair so far.    Updated at 2.20pm BST    2.05pm    6 min: Jota\u2019s ball across the Rangers box is cleared, and then as Celtic push back up, he gets on the end of an Abada cross but nods over. Very difficult to score from there.      2.04pm    4 min: Rangers begin with plenty of energy but Celtic look to score on the counter. Barasic almost lets in Abada and McLaughlin has to rush out to stop the move.      2.03pm    3 min: The smoke is taking its time to dissipate as Celtic begin the game with a spell of possession. But it\u2019s Rangers who go away first, with John Lundstram playing in Ramsey, and then on to Kent, who is blocked by a fine tackle by McGregor.      2.01pm    1 min: They kick off with the Glaswegian air full of smoke. Plenty of pyro, plenty of partying.    Updated at 2.21pm BST    1.54pm    Hampden is bouncing ahead of kick-off, flags waving all over the stands, including those of Ireland and the United Kingdom.   Updated at 1.55pm BST    1.48pm    The Rangers manager, Gio van Bronckhorst, speaks to Premier Sports.   The first time here as a manager, but I played here a lot as a player. We are here to win the game and go to the final. We have to go for it and have the same intensity. That\u2019s what it takes to win games. The game on Thursday was mentally a very big boost for us. Physically we can recover in two days. Reaching the final is our focus now. I think we prepared well. [McLaughlin in for McGregor] He\u2019s a good goalkeeper not only in the cup but in the league, I have full confidence in Jon.       1.42pm    Ange Postecoglou, coming off 33 games unbeaten with Celtic, speaks to Premier Sport.   You don\u2019t come to this place unless it\u2019s a special game, I\u2019m totally looking forward to it. Bring it on. When you get close to achieving things the anxiety kicks in. You join this club with high expectations. I don\u2019t think a lot of rest went on, we worked hard for eight days. We had a good week. We have got to be playing our best football. This is where everything gets decided.       1.27pm    Rangers raised the Roofe on Thursday.       1.14pm    Hearts await in the final for the winner of this one, after Saturday\u2019s capital city derby.   Hearts lost to Celtic in both the 2019 and 2020 finals and they will face either the Rangers or Rangers who play in the other semi-final on Sunday, a game which will no doubt bring its own drama.       1.10pm    What does those teams mean? Liel Abada comes in for Giorgos Giakoumakis in attack. Kyogo Furuhashi, the magic man, is on the bench. Could be some tired legs for Rangers as it\u2019s the same team who went into extra time with Braga, with only Allan McGregor rested, with Jon McLaughlin coming in between the sticks.      1.05pm   Here are the teams  Celtic: Hart, Juranovic, Carter-Vickers, Starfelt, Taylor, McGregor, Hatate, Rogic, Jota, Maeda, Abada. Subs: Bain, Jullien, Kyogo, Turnbull, McCarthy, Ideguchi, Johnston, O\u2019Riley, Forrest, Ralston, Welsh Rangers: McLaughlin, Tavernier, Goldson, Bassey, Barisic, Lundstram, Jack, Aribo, Ramsey, Kent, Roofe. Subs: McGregor, Balogun, King, Davis, Kamara, Sands, Wright, Arfield, Lowry, Diallo, Sakala     1.00pm   Preamble  Just like south of the border, this cup semi has doubles and trebles on the line. Both are still chasing the league title, while Celtic can add the Scottish Cup to the Scottish League Cup. And Rangers are going for an even higher tariff treble in being in the semis of the Europa League. These are exciting times across the Glaswegian giants, and such ratcheting of the stakes must surely makes for a classic Hampden stramash. The two met back at the start of the month, with Celtic taking away a famous win from Ibrox. It\u2019s 2-1 Celtic on meetings between the two so far this season, and there\u2019s one more to follow on 1 May. Familiarity breeding contempt? You bet.  Kick-off is at 2pm, join me.    "

                    "body": "  9.00pm   Closing summary  Donald Trump is in even more legal trouble after the New York attorney general announced a civil suit against him and his children on fraud charges. Elsewhere in the Empire State, president Joe Biden spoke to the United Nations and accused Russia of trying to \u201cerase a sovereign state from the map\u201d by invading Ukraine, in a call for global unity against Moscow. Here\u2019s what else happened today:  The Federal Reserve made a big interest rate hike to fight inflation while trying to avoid putting the US economy into a recession. We could hear from Trump this evening on Fox News, according to CBS News, though he may opt to post on social media instead. Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell came close to voting to convict Trump following the January 6 insurrection, while calling the former president \u201ccrazy,\u201d a new book said. A bill to amend America\u2019s election law and prevent another January 6 is expected to pass the House today. Election officials nationwide are being deluged with public records requests, apparently at the behest of Trump ally and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.      8.52pm    The New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit isn\u2019t the only one Trump is facing in the state. A writer plans to sue the former president under a recently signed law, accusing him of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. E Jean Carroll, the writer who accused Donald Trump of raping her more than two decades ago, plans to file a new lawsuit against the former US president. In a letter made public on Tuesday, a lawyer for the former Elle magazine columnist said she planned to sue Trump for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress under New York state\u2019s Adult Survivors Act. That law, recently signed by the governor, Kathy Hochul, gives adult accusers a one-year window to bring civil claims over alleged sexual misconduct regardless of how long ago it occurred. Trump has denied raping Carroll and accused her of concocting the rape claim to sell her book.      8.37pm    The House is currently debating the Presidential Election Reform Act, which would tweak the procedures for counting votes to prevent the type of legal schemes that occurred around of the time of the January 6 insurrection from taking place again. A vote to approve the measure could come later today, but the Democrats controlling the chamber have plans for more bills in the weeks before the midterms. The Associated Press reports that a deal between the party\u2019s progressive and centrist faction has been reached to increase funding for police departments:  The breakthrough came after intense negotiations in recent days between Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a leader of the centrist coalition, and Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn., one of the leaders of the progressive faction. Their deal, reached with little time to spare on the House calendar, could help unite the party on a public safety platform more than two years after the police killing of George Floyd. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have worked closely with Republicans, Democrats, and a broad spectrum of stakeholders to make real progress for public safety,\u201d Gottheimer said in a statement Wednesday. The package includes reforms to ensure police funding is used to support smaller police departments, along with investments in de-escalation training and mental health resources for officers to reduce fatal encounters between police and people with mental illness. \u201cWith this package, House Democrats have the opportunity to model a holistic, inclusive approach to public safety, and keep our promise to families across the country to address this issue at the federal level,\u201d Omar and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a statement.  The bills have the backing of policing groups, but it\u2019s unclear if they will be able to clear the much higher bar for passage in the Senate, where the Democratic majority would need the support of at least 10 Republicans.     8.22pm    Last year, Julie Rikelman argued on behalf of abortion rights in front of the supreme court. This year, she has pledged to uphold the court\u2019s decision overturning abortion rights nationwide if confirmed as a federal appellate judge. Bloomberg Law reports on the exchange that took place during Rikelman\u2019s confirmation hearing for the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which covers the northeastern United States. Rikelman argued before the supreme court on behalf of the Center for Reproductive Rights as they considered Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. When it decided that case, the conservative-dominated court not only upheld a Mississippi law curbing abortion access, it also overturned Roe v Wade entirely, allowing states to ban the procedure. \u201cOur legal system and the rule of law itself depends on lower courts following Supreme Court precedent and as you said Dobbs is now the law of the land and I will follow it as I will follow all Supreme Court precedent,\u201d Rikelman said in her confirmation hearing before the Senate judiciary committee.     8.02pm    A candidate embellishing their background isn\u2019t unheard of on the campaign trail, but CNN has a story today on something unique and far more troubling going on at election offices across the country. Administrators nationwide are being hit with a deluge of public records requests for massive amounts of election data, CNN reports, including the little-known cast vote records generated by voting machines. The concern is that the requests will complicate the work of voting officials nationwide ahead of the November midterms.  The requests appear to be traced back to Mike Lindell, a prominent Trump ally and conspiracy theorist who encouraged people to make such requests a month ago:  In a telephone interview with CNN, Lindell said he first learned of the cast vote records in June and views them as a way to \u201cdetect machine manipulation\u201d of the 2020 election. Asked how they would, he said: \u201cYou\u2019d have to talk to a cyber guy... It\u2019s the sequence and the patterns.\u201d Lindell has spent nearly two years spreading falsehoods about the 2020 election. Dominion Voting Systems, the frequent target of his attacks, has sued Lindell and his company for defamation. Lindell said the records would bolster his effort to rid the election system of machines. Some of the requesters, he said, are taking what they found to local county officials and sheriffs to demand the removal of machines in their counties. \u201cI want computers and voting machines gone,\u201d he said.  Voting officials have had to bring on new staff to handle them, but according to CNN, many people making the requests act as if they are just following orders. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know what this is. I don\u2019t know what it does. I just know I\u2019m supposed to ask for it,\u2019\u201d is what one official said the requesters often say.     7.42pm    The pitch to voters made by J.R. Majewski, who is running to unseat a long-serving Democrat in an Ohio district redrawn in the GOP\u2019s favor, is this: elect a Donald Trump-backed conservative who served his country in Afghanistan. The only problem being that the last part isn\u2019t true, according to an investigation just released by the Associated Press. The article says it all:  Campaigning for a northwestern Ohio congressional seat, Republican J.R. Majewski presents himself as an Air Force combat veteran who deployed to Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, once describing \u201ctough\u201d conditions including a lack of running water that forced him to go more than 40 days without a shower. Military documents obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request tell a different story. They indicate Majewski never deployed to Afghanistan but instead completed a six-month stint helping to load planes at an air base in Qatar, a longtime U.S. ally that is a safe distance from the fighting. Majewski\u2019s account of his time in the military is just one aspect of his biography that is suspect. His post-military career has been defined by exaggerations, conspiracy theories, talk of violent action against the U.S. government and occasional financial duress.   Updated at 7.44pm BST    7.19pm   Federal Reserve makes another big rate hike to fight US inflation  The Federal Reserve made yet another aggressive interest rate hike at the conclusion of its meeting today as it looks to cut into the rapid price growth that\u2019s beset the US economy without causing a recession. The three-quarter percentage point increase in the central bank\u2019s funds rate approved by the Federal Open Market Committee is the third straight hike of that size, and comes after data released earlier this month showed inflation declining by less than expected in August. Led by Jerome Powell, a Republican whom president Joe Biden nominated for a second term last year, the American central bank ended the easy money policies it rolled out during the Covid-19 pandemic and earlier this year started raising rates and running down its massive holdings of debt. The catalyst was price pressures that rose throughout 2021, prompting the Fed to abruptly pivot from a strategy of spurring growth by keeping borrowing costs low to rapidly increasing rates as inflation hit levels not seen since the 1980s. However, analysts say the Fed waited too long to begin hiking, allowing inflation to get far worse than necessary as it was being driven higher by factors like Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and supply shocks caused by the pandemic. The concern now is that the central bank \u2013 which uses interest rates as a powerful but blunt tool to stabilize employment and prices in the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 could cause a recession that undermines the recovery made by American workers and businesses over the past two years.     6.55pm    Liberal pundits and Twitter accounts are cheering the investigation into Donald Trump for holding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. What they may not know is that they are also throwing their support behind one of the most pernicious and terrible laws that exists: the Espionage Act.  Holding Trump accountable doesn\u2019t mean we should all become cheerleaders for an often-abused law primarily used to prosecute whistleblowers and threaten journalists. Ever since the 100-year old Espionage Act was cited in the warrant for the search of Trump\u2019s Florida residence, Twitter and cable news have been rife with misinformation about the law and what it means. Those clamoring for Trump to be prosecuted under the act are spreading a ton of misleading statements in the process. First, let\u2019s get this out of the way: just because the law is called \u201cthe Espionage Act\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there is any evidence Trump committed \u201cespionage\u201d. MSNBC hosts and their former CIA guests are even baselessly speculating that because Trump had these documents at his house, it is connected to the spate of deaths of CIA assets around the world. What a convenient excuse for the CIA! There\u2019s not one hint of evidence that Trump having some classified docs at this compound led to any deaths, and it lets the CIA completely off the hook for continually getting people killed, which \u2013 by the way \u2013 has been happening for decades.  There was a New York Times investigation from several years ago about CIA asset networks in China and Iran being rounded up and executed, which dated back to 2010. Or go read Tim Weiner\u2019s classic history of the CIA, Legacy of Ashes, which details how that has happened over and over again throughout the agency\u2019s history, with little or no public accountability. Read more:      6.34pm    The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, warned last month that there would be \u201cpain\u201d ahead as the US central bank struggles to contain a surge in inflation unseen in 40 years.   Powell will offer some indication of how much pain he expects at 2pm today. The Fed is expected to announce another sharp rise in interest rates after the conclusion of its latest meeting. It will also update its economic forecasts for the US economy. Economists are predicting the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, the third such rise in a row, and signal plans to raise rates again in the coming months. Full preview:      6.24pm    The Fox News anchor Bret Baier wanted the network to withdraw its famous call of Arizona for Joe Biden on election night in 2020, citing pressure from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and saying the swing state should be \u201cput back in his column\u201d, a new book says.  The news is contained in The Divider: Trump in the White House 2017-2021, published in the US on Tuesday. The authors, Peter Baker of the New York Times and Susan Glasser of the New Yorker, call Baier\u2019s request \u201cstunning\u201d, as Arizona \u201cwas never in Trump\u2019s column. While the margin of his defeat in the state had narrowed since election night, he still trailed by more than 10,000 votes.\u201d In a statement emailed to the Guardian by a Fox News spokesperson, Baier responded to the report. He said: \u201cThe full context of the e-mail is not reported in this book. \u201cI never said the Trump campaign \u2018was really pissed\u2019 \u2013 that was from an external email that I referenced within my note. This was an email sent after election night. \u201cIn the immediate days following the election, the vote margins in Arizona narrowed significantly and I communicated these changes to our team along with what people on the ground were saying and predicting district by district. I wanted to analyse at what point (what vote margin) would we have to consider pulling the call for Biden. I also noted that I fully supported our Decision Desk\u2019s call and would defend it on air.\u201d Full story:      6.04pm    Joe Biden\u2019s speech at the United Nations touched on the war in Ukraine, climate change, China and global food security. Republicans were not impressed. \u201cEnabling adversaries, ducking blame, and putting America last is Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy doctrine. From Afghanistan to the open border, Joe Biden has destroyed America\u2019s standing on the world stage, placed Americans in harm\u2019s way, and has made our communities less safe as a result,\u201d Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement released following his address. As he met with United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and his deputies, a reporter asked Biden to comment further on Russia. He replied:      5.49pm   The day so far  Donald Trump is in even more legal trouble after the New York attorney general announced a civil suit against him and his children on fraud charges. Elsewhere in the Empire State, president Joe Biden spoke to the United Nations and accused Russia of trying to \u201cerase a sovereign state from the map\u201d by invading Ukraine, in a call for global unity against Moscow. Here\u2019s what else happened today:  We could hear from Trump this evening on Fox News, according to CBS News, though he may opt to post on social media instead. Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell came close to voting to convict Trump following the January 6 insurrection, while calling the former president \u201ccrazy,\u201d a new book said. A bill to amend America\u2019s election law and prevent another January 6 could be voted on in the House today.      5.30pm    Donald Trump could appear on conservative commentator Sean Hannity\u2019s show on Fox News this evening, CBS News reports. That would give the ex-president the opportunity to respond to the New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit and fraud allegations against him and his family members, though he may opt to do so elsewhere, such as on his Truth social media network.      5.14pm    New York attorney general Letitia James has released a statement elaborating on her newly announced lawsuit against Donald Trump, saying \u201cthere are not two sets of laws for people in this country,\u201d even for former presidents. Here\u2019s the full statement released by the state\u2019s Democratic top lawyer:  For too long, powerful, wealthy people in this country have operated as if the rules do not apply to them. Donald Trump stands out as among the most egregious examples of this misconduct. With the help of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and cheat the system. In fact, the very foundation of his purported net worth is rooted in incredible fraud and illegality. Mr. Trump thought he could get away with the art of the steal, but today, that conduct ends. There are not two sets of laws for people in this country; we must hold former presidents to the same standards as everyday Americans. I will continue to ensure that no one is able to evade the law, because no one is above it.      4.58pm   New York attorney general sues Trump, children over alleged fraud  The New York attorney general, Letitia James, just announced a lawsuit against Donald Trump and his family, accusing them of fraudulently inflating their net worth by billions of dollars to get better terms on bank loans and other financial benefits. Here\u2019s more fromthe Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly on the suit, which presents the latest in the many legal threats facing the former president:  The attorney general of New York state has filed a civil lawsuit against Donald Trump and members of his family, the culmination of a years-long investigation of financial practices at the Trump Organization. Letitia James announced the suit in New York on Wednesday. In a statement, the attorney general said the suit was filed \u201cagainst Donald Trump, the Trump Organization, senior management and involved entities for engaging in years of financial fraud to obtain a host of economic benefits. \u201cThe lawsuit alleges that Donald Trump, with the help of his children Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, and senior executives of the Trump Organization, falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to induce banks to lend money to the Trump Organization on more favorable terms than would otherwise have been available to the company, to satisfy continuing loan covenants, induce insurers to provide insurance coverage for higher limits and lower premiums, and to gain tax benefits, among other things.\u201d    Updated at 5.48pm BST    4.47pm    Biden wrapped up his speech with an appeal to unity that mentioned neither Ukraine or Russia, but instead referenced the ideals he had earlier said Moscow violated by invading its neighbor. \u201cLet\u2019s stand together again, declare the unmistakable resolve. The nations of the world are united still,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cWe stand for the values of the UN Charter.\u201d \u201cWe still believe by working together, we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it. We\u2019re not passive witnesses to history. We are the authors of history. We can do this, we have to do it, for ourselves and for our future. For humankind,\u201d Biden concluded.  Updated at 4.48pm BST    4.39pm    One of the most alarming comments Putin made in his speech earlier today was alluding to the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict \u2013 words that caught Biden\u2019s attention. \u201cA nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought,\u201d the American president said before the UN General Assembly, accusing Russia of \u201cmaking irresponsible nuclear threats.\u201d He also said Moscow was ignoring a nonproliferation agreement, and conducting \u201can unprecedented, concerning nuclear buildup without any transparency.\u201d  Updated at 4.44pm BST    4.35pm    Biden has shifted his focus to China, saying Washington isn\u2019t looking for a \u201ccold war\u201d, while underscoring the substantial policy differences with Beijing. \u201cLet me be direct about the competition between the United States and China,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict, we do not seek a cold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner. But the United States will be unabashed and promoting our vision of a free, open, secure and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations.\u201d He also mentioned Taiwan, saying \u201cwe continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side\u201d amid speculation Beijing intends to seize the island it considers a breakaway province by force.     4.27pm    Much of Biden\u2019s appeal on behalf of Ukraine focused on Russia\u2019s violation of the UN charter, which is intended to stop countries from attacking each other without reason. But he also said it was time to change how things are done in the global body, including by expanding the security council beyond its current five permanent members. \u201cI also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive, so they can better respond to the needs of today\u2019s world. Members of the UN Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the UN charter and refrain refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non permanent representatives of the Council. This includes permanent seats for those nations. We have long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201d The five permanent members are currently China, France, Russia, the United States and Britain, which has more or less remained static since 1945.  Updated at 4.28pm BST    4.19pm    If it can happen to Ukraine, it can happen to you. That\u2019s the meat of Biden\u2019s argument thus far before world leaders assembled in New York City, where he\u2019s seeking to bolster international support for Ukraine and encourage countries that have remained on the fence to form up behind Kyiv. \u201cIf nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for, everything,\u201d Biden said, adding that a country \u201ccannot seize a nation\u2019s territory by force.\u201d \u201cUkraine has the same rights belong to every sovereign nation. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine who will stand in solidarity against Russia\u2019s aggression, period.\u201d     4.14pm    Biden has kicked off his UN speech with strong rhetoric against Russia, pointed to the global body\u2019s own rules to characterize Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as illegal and reckless. \u201cA permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded his neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map. Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter,\u201d Biden said, as he accused president Vladimir Putin of causing a \u201cbrutal, needless war.\u201d \u201cThis war is about extinguishing Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a people,\u201d the American president said. \u201cWherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe\u2026 That should make your blood run cold.\u201d     4.09pm   Biden set to rebuke Putin, rally world for Ukraine in UN general assembly speech  US president Joe Biden has taken the stage to address world leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York City, where he is expected to forcefully condemn Russia\u2019s destructive invasion of Ukraine and call on the world to stand up against Moscow. The American leader\u2019s speech before the UN\u2019s first general assembly since Russia began its incursion comes hours after Russian president Vladimir Putin put the country\u2019s people and economy on a war footing by announcing a partial mobilization, while also suggesting he was willing to use nuclear weapons. The Guardian\u2019s politics live blog will cover Biden\u2019s speech as it happens, and video of his address will also be embedded above.  Updated at 4.16pm BST    3.51pm    Expect strong rhetoric against Moscow when Joe Biden speaks before the United Nations. But in Washington, administration officials are trying to maintain that the United States is not at war with Russia. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said as much in an interview with Fox News this morning:  Meanwhile, Democratic senator Chris Murphy warned on MSNBC that if Republicans take the House following the November midterms, they could block further aid packages to Ukraine:      3.31pm    While events in Washington and New York City will dominate today\u2019s news cycle, spare some time to read Coral Murphy Marcos\u2019s coverage of the unfolding crisis in the US territory of Puerto Rico, where a hurricane has badly damaged the island\u2019s drinking water supply. Hurricane Fiona was the second time Jos\u00e9 Oyola R\u00edos served as an emergency drinking water provider, after gusting winds and heavy rains battered Puerto Rico on Sunday, causing mass flooding and power outages. Oyola R\u00edos serves as a community leader in rural, inland Caguas, in the central mountain range, where he maintains water tanks that store thousands of gallons, known in the area as the \u201ccommunity oasis\u201d. When Hurricane Mar\u00eda battered the island in 2017, hundreds of residents from surrounding towns would drive up the mountainous road to Caguas to get a few gallons of water.      3.15pm    In other Trump news, the Associated Press reports that the special master demanded by the former president\u2019s lawyers had little time for their evasiveness over whether the classified materials found at Mar-a-Lago had actually been cleared for release: The independent arbiter tasked with inspecting documents seized in an FBI search of Donald Trump\u2019s Florida home said on Tuesday he intends to push briskly through the review process and appeared skeptical of Trump lawyers\u2019 reluctance to say whether they believed the records had been declassified. \u201cWe\u2019re going to proceed with what I call responsible dispatch,\u201d Raymond Dearie, a veteran Brooklyn judge, told lawyers for Trump and the Department of Justice in their first meeting since his appointment last week as a so-called special master. The purpose of the meeting was to sort out next steps in a review process expected to slow the criminal investigation into the retention of top-secret information at Mar-a-Lago. Dearie will be responsible for sifting through the thousands of documents recovered during the 8 August FBI search and segregating any that might be protected by claims of executive privilege or attorney-client privilege.      3.01pm    \u201cWe\u2019ve all known that Trump is crazy. I\u2019m done with him. I will never speak to him again.\u201d Those words were uttered by the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, after he returned to the Capitol on January 6. That\u2019s according to UNCHECKED: The Untold Story Behind Congress\u2019s Botched Impeachments of Donald Trump, by Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade and The Washington Post\u2019s Karoun Demirjian, which was excerpted in the latter publication today. While the enmity between Trump and McConnnell is well documented, the book goes on to say that the senator almost supported the effort to convict Trump for the January 6 insurrection after his departure from the White House, but backed down after determining there was simply too much support for the ex-president among his fellow senators. Here\u2019s more from the excerpt:  McConnell knew many of his rank-and-file were torn over how to handle the situation \u2014 and that in their uncertainty, they would look to him for guidance. If he declared the trial to be constitutional, breaking with Trump in the process, he could set the stage for a party mutiny, helping the GOP turn the page on Trump for good. It was an appealing prospect: conviction could enable the Senate to bar Trump from holding office again \u2014 and McConnell didn\u2019t ever want Trump in office again. But in all his years as GOP leader, McConnell had never led such a rebellion. And that day, he wasn\u2019t sure he was up to the task.   Updated at 3.22pm BST    2.42pm    Some of the most steadfast Republican supporters of Donald Trump in Congress can be found in the House, so perhaps it should not be a surprise that the party\u2019s leadership there is encouraging a no vote on legislation amending America\u2019s electoral code to stop another January 6. \u201cIn their continued fixation to inject the Federal government into elections, this legislation runs counter to reforms necessary to strengthen the integrity of our elections,\u201d the office of House Republican whip Steve Scalise wrote in an email distributed to members on Tuesday. \u201cThis bill, which contains unconstitutional provisions, is the Democrats\u2019 latest attempt at a federal takeover of elections in order to stack the electoral deck in their favor.\u201d It goes on to enumerate a number of issues with the Presidential Election Reform Act, including that it \u201ccreates new and broad private rights of action that can be easily abused by Democrat election lawyers to drag out elections long after Election Day,\u201d and that it \u201cunconstitutionally empowers Congress and Federal judges to decide and interpret state election laws, instead of states themselves.\u201d The effort seems unlikely to stop the bill\u2019s progress. Democrats have a majority in the chamber, and the legislation may also attract votes from some House republicans who disagree with the plot attempted on January 6. A bigger question is how the House effort can be reconciled with legislation expected to be approved by the Senate, and whether the lower chamber\u2019s more expansive measure will spark any disagreement among senators.     2.27pm    Ukraine isn\u2019t the only country worrying about its democracy. In Washington, the House of Representatives will today begin debate on a bill to stop the sort of legal shenanigans Donald Trump\u2019s allies attempted on January 6 to prevent Joe Biden from taking office. The Associated Press reports that the measure is the lower chamber\u2019s version of separate legislation under consideration in the Senate, and would overhaul the United States\u2019 archaic election law to stop political objections from preventing the accession of a new president. Here\u2019s more on the bill, from the AP:  The bill, which is similar to legislation moving through the Senate, would clarify in the law that the vice president\u2019s role presiding over the count is only ceremonial and also sets out that each state can only send one certified set of electors. Trump\u2019s allies had unsuccessfully tried to put together alternate slates of illegitimate pro-Trump electors in swing states where Biden won. The legislation would increase the threshold for individual lawmakers\u2019 objections to any state\u2019s electoral votes, requiring a third of the House and a third of the Senate to object to trigger votes on the results in both chambers. Currently, only one lawmaker in the House and one lawmaker in the Senate has to object. The House bill would set out very narrow grounds for those objections, an attempt to thwart baseless or politically motivated challenges. The legislation also would require courts to get involved if state or local officials want to delay a presidential vote or refuse to certify the results. The House vote comes as the Senate is moving on a similar track with enough Republican support to virtually ensure passage before the end of the year. After months of talks, House Democrats introduced the legislation on Monday and are holding a quick vote two days later in order to send the bill across the Capitol and start to resolve differences. A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation this summer and a Senate committee is expected to vote on it next week.      2.12pm    When he speaks at the first United Nations General Assembly since Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden will cast the assault as a violation of the global body\u2019s ideals, while also announcing that the United States will put its economic heft behind an effort to help poor countries survive the spike in food prices that has pushed some to the brink of crisis. That\u2019s according to The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger in New York and Andrew Roth in Moscow as they previewed the American president\u2019s address set for 10:35 am eastern time. Here\u2019s more on what we can expect, from US national security adviser Jake Sullivan:  \u201cHe [Biden] will underscore the importance of strengthening the United Nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the security council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.\u201d  Later in the day, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will make his own appeal to world leaders in a video address that Russia, unsuccessfully, tried to halt. And European leaders who already addressed the assembly used it as a platform to cast Moscow\u2019s campaign as an imperialist project. \u201cThose who are keeping silent today are, in a way, complicit with the cause of a new imperialism,\u201d said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in his speech on Tuesday.  Updated at 3.21pm BST    1.56pm   Biden expected to take on Putin in address to world leaders  Good morning, US politics blog readers. A new front in the war in Ukraine is opening temporarily in New York City today, when Joe Biden addresses world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly at 10:35am ET in the wake of Vladimir Putin\u2019s speech threatening to use nuclear weapons and ordering a partial mobilization in Russia. The American president is certainly not the only world leader speaking, but as a major supplier of aid for Kyiv, Biden\u2019s address will be closely watched for signs of how the Western allies intend to respond to Putin\u2019s latest gambit. Today\u2019s news does not stop there:  The Federal Reserve will likely again raise interest rates in a decision announced at 2pm eastern time. The central bank is trying to lower America\u2019s worryingly high inflation without tightening fiscal conditions so much the economy enters a recession. The National Cathedral in Washington DC is holding a memorial service in honor of Queen Elizabeth II at 11am, which vice-president Kamala Harris will attend. Gas prices appear to be rising again after nearly 100 days of declines, though there is some dispute over when the latest uptick started.   "

                    "body": "Bleaching in marine sponges in temperate waters off Tasmania\u2019s east coast has been observed for the first time, with scientists warning the discovery could be an indicator of climate change in deeper reef systems. Researchers at the University of Tasmania\u2019s Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies used seafloor surveys to discover the bleaching of cup sponges in the Flinders commonwealth marine reserve after heatwave events.  The sponges, which are ordinarily reddish-purple in colour, live in a mesophotic ecosystem \u2013 the twilight zone at depths between 30 metres and 150 metres \u2013 that bridges brightly lit shallow waters and the darkness of deep ocean. Images of the bleached cup sponges were captured in 2017 but not analysed until later. The research findings were recently published in the journal Climate Change Ecology. \u201cThere seems to be a pattern going on with increased bleaching through time,\u201d Dr Nick Perkins, the study\u2019s lead author, said. Perkins said the bleaching of cup sponges could act \u201cas a canary in the coalmine\u201d to indicate the impact of climate change on rocky reefs in temperate waters. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any mass mortality of the sponges so far \u2026 but it is really important to track what is happening on these deeper reefs.\u201d  Sea temperatures off Tasmania\u2019s east coast have risen at nearly four times the global average. The region experienced intense marine heatwaves in both 2015-16 and 2017-18. Neville Barrett, an associate professor who led the seabed monitoring research, said the discovery pointed to the likely impacts of climate change on biodiversity. \u201cAs things do warm up with climate change over the next century or two, a lot of these deeper species will move south,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest problem is that whatever endemic species we\u2019ve got here in Tasmania now, they\u2019ve got nowhere to go as things warm up.\u201d Barrett said sponges played an important role in drawing nutrients from seawater and \u201cconverting them into material that feeds reef production\u201d. Off Tasmania\u2019s east coast, the cup sponges support fisheries of rock lobster and striped trumpeter, Barrett said. \u201cOnce you get down below the algal zone of 30 to 40 metres, it\u2019s all sponge-dominated seabed. There\u2019s no kelp there.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   Images of the cup sponges were captured by autonomous underwater vehicles during surveys between 2009 and 2017. The sponge bleaching was later identified by Phoebe Gallagher, a marine science student, when analysing the imagery. The researchers said more work was necessary to precisely establish the threshold temperature \u2013 and duration of warming \u2013 that would result in bleaching, as well as how long the bleaching persisted for."

My colleague Edward Helmore has the story here.\n\nIrish Americans like Kennedy are often more sympathetic to the nationalist cause in Northern Ireland than unionism and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said it would be up to Kennedy to show he was even-handed. He said:\n\nWe welcome the fact that the United States is interested in developing economic links with Northern Ireland.\nThe appointment of an envoy demonstrates that commitment.\nI think it is for Joe Kennedy to prove he will be even-handed in his approach.\nHe needs to take account of unionist views and concerns in relation to the economy.\nWhile his role is economic matters, one can\u2019t avoid the (Northern Ireland) protocol and the harm it is doing to our economy.\nIt will be important for the United States to gain a better understanding of the real concerns that unionists have about the protocol.\n\n\n\n\n 5.59pm  \nAlcohol duty freeze extended for six months, Treasury ministers tells MPs\n\nJames Cartlidge, a Treasury minister, has confirmed that the freeze on alcohol duty will be extended for a further six months, to 1 August 2023. In a statement to MPs he said:\n\nWhilst new duty rates typically come in each year on the first of February, I can confirm that the chancellor will instead make his decision on future duty rates at spring budget 2023 to give businesses certainty and time to prepare.\nTo further support the industry, we are going further by confirming that if changes to duty are announced then they will not take effect until 1 August 2023.\nThis is to align with the date the historic forms of alcohol duties come into force and amounts to an effective six-month extension to the current duty freeze.\n\nThere are further details in the Treasury\u2019s press release.\n\nUpdated at 6.12pm GMT\n\n\n 5.54pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 5.19pm  \n\nWhen Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, complained about a Russian judge blocking UK government policy (see 4.36pm), he seemed to be making a general point about the background of the judges who sit on the European court of human rights, rather than a statement of fact about the Rwanda hearing. The identity of the judge who granted the injunction against the UK was not revealed, but at the time the Telegraph said the judge who took the decision was understood to be either the representative from Hungary or a judge from Liechtenstein.\nRussia did used to nominate a judge to the court because it used to be a member of the Council of Europe, which oversees its operation. After the invasion of Ukraine this year Russia was expelled from the council. But its judge was entitled to sit on the court until September, the Telegraph reported.\n\nUpdated at 5.23pm GMT\n\n\n 4.55pm  \nBraverman says 'nothing off table' when asked if new asylum bill will allow human rights law to be overruled\n\nGreg Smith (Con) also asks for an assurance that the asylum legislation coming next year will contain a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause to allow the Human Rights Act to be ignored. He is the third Tory to make this request. Sir Bill Cash (see 4.31pm) and Sir Edward Leigh have already made the same point.\nBraverman says the government will pass legislation that is robust. As for what it will contain, she says \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d.\nA \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of the kind demanded by Smith and others would have the same effect as the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d legislation proposed by the Tory MP Jonathan Gullis in a 10-minute rule speech last week. Sixty-seven Tory MPs voted in favour.\nUPDATE: Here is the question from Leigh, which came a few minutes before Smith\u2019s. Leigh said:\n\nWhile this judgment is welcome, it won\u2019t solve the problem. Not just because of the relatively few numbers that can be deported to Rwanda, but because each case must be fought individually and human rights lawyers will fight every single case individually.\nThat is the problem. Surely the only serious way we can deter migration across the Channel is to have the legal right not just to process people when they arrive on our shores, but to arrest them and detain them until their asylum application is dealt with.\nIf it\u2019s the Human Rights Act that stops us doing it, can we not apply in our new legislation for a notwithstanding clause to deal with that problem?\n\n\nUpdated at 6.04pm GMT\n\n\n 4.41pm  \n\nJohn Whittingdale, the Tory former cabinet minister, said he visited Rwanda recently and saw the accommodation available for refugees. He says the Rwandans were clear that they expected asylum seekers to be able to get jobs. So the policy is moral, he says.\n\n\n\n 4.40pm  \n\nStella Creasy (Lab) asks if children will be deported to Rwanda.\nBraverman says families are not subject to the policy.\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory former business secretary, says once parliament has made up its mind, it should not be possible for it to be overuled by \u201ca Russian judgen woken from a bar to issue an injunction\u201d. He is referring to the European court of human rights.\nBraverman welcomes Rees-Mogg\u2019s argument.\n\n\n\n 4.34pm  \n\nThe SNP\u2019s Alison Thewliss says that just because a policy has been ruled lawful, that does not make it right. She says slaver, apartheid and rape within marriage were both once legal, but that did not mean they were right.\nUPDATE: Thewliss said:\n\nThis is a dark day indeed with this judgment. And particularly when the home Secretary comes here to imply that having morals is fanciful.\nOn the SNP benches we will never get behind this policy. Not in our name.\nI would remind people in this house that slavery, apartheid and marital rape were all lawful at one time, but none of them were right.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.02pm GMT\n\n\n 4.31pm  \n\nSir Bill Cash (Con) urges Braverman to introduce \u201cnothwithstanding\u201d legislation, allowing the UK government to go ahead with its deportation policy regardless of what international human rights law says.\nBraverman welcomes what Cash says. But she says the European court of human rights has not said the government\u2019s policy is illegal. But it did rule against the removal of some individuals, she says.\n\n\n\n 4.27pm  \n\nBraverman is replying to Cooper.\nShe claims Labour is not being honest. It won\u2019t even say if it would repeal the legislation making entry to the UK without proper authorisation illegal, she says.\nWhat Labour would do would replace a crisis of illegal immigration with a crisis of legal migration, she says. It would be an open borders policy by the back door.\n\n\n\n 4.25pm  \n\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is responding to Braverman. She says if Braverman thinks the court judgment is a vindication of her policy, she has not read it properly. She says the court decided that the decision-making in relation to the eight cases considered was \u201cso flawed and chaotic\u201d that the decisions had to be quashed. She says in some cases mistakes were as basic as names being mixed up.\nShe asks how many people might be sent to Rwanda. She says Rwanda has said it could take 200 people, a tiny fraction of the number arriving in the UK on small boats.\nAnd she asks how much it will cost.

Since 2015 it has welcomed 450,000 people to this country through safe and legal routes.\nBut people do not want open borders, she says. She says people used to be told that those holding these views were \u201cimmoral\u201d, and even today, she claims, there is \u201cunhealthy contempt for anyone who wants controlled migration\u201d.\nShe says the government cannot tolerate people coming to the UK illegally. That is why it negotiated the partnership with Rwanda for asylum seekers to be taken there.\nShe says there is a myth that the permanent secretary at the Home Office opposed the policy and said was poor value for money. That is not true, she says. But she accepts that the permanent secretary said the evidence was not available to show it would serve as a deterrent.\nShe says today\u2019s high court judgment has vindicated her strategy.\nShe says she spoke to her Rwandan counterpart today, and they both confirmed their commitment \u201cto deliver this partnership at scale as soon as possible\u201d.\nShe urges Labour to back the plan.\n\nUpdated at 4.28pm GMT\n\n\n 4.05pm  \nGovernment sues PPE firm linked to Michelle Mone for breach of contract\n\nThe government has issued civil legal proceedings against PPE Medpro, the PPE firm linked to the Tory peer Michelle Mone, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nThe firm said the case over the supply of sterile gowns would be \u201crigorously defended\u201d and accused the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) of a \u201ccynical attempt to recover money from suppliers\u201d who acted in good faith.\nThe DHSC said it had issued breach of contract proceedings over the 2020 deal on the supply of gowns.\nA statement issued by the firm said: \u201cPPE Medpro will demonstrate to the courts that we supplied our gowns to the correct specification, on time and at a highly competitive price. The case will also show the utter incompetence of DHSC to correctly procure and specify PPE during the emergency procurement period. This will be the real legacy of the court case and it will be played out in the public arena for all to see.\u201d\nPA understands the dispute relates to the contract price of the gowns, plus the cost of storing and disposing of them.\nBut PPE Medpro claimed the department was fighting over \u201ccontract technicalities\u201d such as whether gowns were single or double-bagged because it had \u201cvastly over-ordered\u201d protective equipment.\nThe firm said it had made \u201cnumerous attempts at mediation with DHSC\u201d but \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to settle\u201d.\nThe PPE Medpro statement said: \u201cOver a two month period, July through to end of August 2020, PPE Medpro supplied DHSC with 25 million sterile gowns. The gowns were manufactured to the correct quality, standards and specification set out in the contract, delivered on time and at a price that was 50% of what DHSC had been paying at the time.\u201d\nBut \u201cby the end of 2020 it was clear that DHSC has vastly over ordered and held five years supply of PPE across the seven major categories including gowns\u201d and because of limited lifespans for products \u201cit was clear that the DHSC would never be able to use all the PPE they procured\u201d, the statement said.\n\u201cConsultants were then brought in to pick over all the contracts and fight product not on quality but on contract technicalities that were never envisaged at the time of contract.\u201d\nA DHSC spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm we have commenced legal proceedings in the high court against PPE Medpro Limited for breach of contract regarding gowns delivered under a contract dated June 26, 2020. We do not comment on matters that are the subject of ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.39pm  \nTories no longer ahead of Labour on party most trusted to grow economy, poll suggests\n\nThe polling company Ipsos has published its latest monthly political monitor report. Among the many charts in it is one showing that the Conservatives no longer lead Labour on which party is most trusted on being able to grow the economy. Labour has had a healthy lead for some time on the party most trusted to cut the cost of living. But on growing the economy, both parties are now level.\nThe chart shows that in September the Tories briefly leapt well ahead on this measure. That was after they elected a new leader, Liz Truss, who said her main priority was promoting growth.\nNow the party has fallen back on the same measure \u2013 almost certainly as a result of voters seeing what actually happened when Truss tried to achieve this.\n\nThe same poll suggests that Labour goes into Christmas with a 26-point lead over the Tories.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.41pm GMT\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nThe SNP says in its response to the high court judgment that the Rwanda deportation policy is \u201cdeeply immoral\u201d, regardless of whether it is legal or not. This is from Alison Thewliss, the SNP\u2019s home affairs spokesperson at Westminster.\n\nWhether legal or not, this move is deeply immoral and will only serve to endanger those the UK government has a duty to protect.\nThose fleeing war, famine and oppression deserve and need our full support. Instead the Tories have chosen to make scapegoats of desperate people in a disgusting attempt to cover up their own domestic policy failings.\nCountries like the UK should act as a beacon of hope and serve as a positive example to the rest of the world. Sadly that is no longer how the UK is viewed, and so it falls upon an independent Scotland to show a just and humanitarian welcome to whoever needs it, whenever they need it.\n\n\n\n\n 3.03pm  \n\nColin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, has posted a detailed commentary on the high court Rwanda judgment on his Free Movement migration policy blog. Here is his conclusion:\n\nWhatever happens, it is unlikely that more than a relatively small number would ever be removed, though. Firstly, Rwanda has indicated so far that it will accept a few hundred per year. That figure could rise or further deals might be reached but there is no sign of either eventuality at present. Secondly, the Home Office is pretty terrible at removing anyone anywhere at the moment. On past form, the idea that the Home Office can remove sufficient number of people to Rwanda to act as a deterrent to others seems implausible, although not perhaps completely impossible. Over 85,000 people have arrived in the UK to claim asylum in the twelve months ending September 2022.\nA lot of time, energy and money has been put into this Rwanda plan. It has acted as a distraction from the asylum backlog and other issues. Yet it seems to have escaped everyone\u2019s notice that removals of actual failed asylum seekers to their own countries has reached an historic low. A total of 113 failed asylum seekers were removed in the whole of 2021 (see Returns \u2013 Summary Tables, table Ret_05, published 26 May 2022). The numbers have risen slightly since then, but not a lot. Why put all this effort into removing a small number of genuine refugees to Rwanda rather than actual failed asylum seekers back to their own countries?\n\n\nUpdated at 3.07pm GMT\n\n\n 2.35pm  \nSunak urges unions to do 'everything they can' to minimise impact of health strikes\n\nAnd here are some more lines from Rishi Sunak\u2019s broadcast interview in Riga.\n\nSunak urged the unions to do everything they could to minimise the impact of this week\u2019s health strikes, if they were not willing to call them off. He said:\n\n\nI\u2019m really disappointed to see that the unions are calling these strikes, particularly at Christmas, particularly when it has such an impact on people\u2019s day-to-day lives with the disruption it causes and the impact on their health.\nI would urge them to keep considering whether these strikes are really necessary and do everything they can to alleviate the impact it\u2019s going to have on people.\nThe government, for its part, is being responsible in putting in place contingency measures to make sure we are well prepared to handle the disruption that is coming.\n\nIn an article for the Mail on Sunday yesterday, Steve Barclay, the health secretary, claimed that \u201csome unions representing ambulance crews are being less than cooperative in negotiations about staff cover on strike days\u201d.\n\nSunak said the door was \u201calways open\u201d for the unions to meet ministers \u2013 but he seemed to rule out holding new talks on pay. He said:\n\n\nOur door is always open - the health secretary has been very clear with that - of course we are always happy to sit down and talk to people to try and work through difficult challenges like this, that\u2019s always been the case.\n\nBut, on pay, he stressed the importance of the \u201cindependent process\u201d (having pay review bodies make recommendations). He also said the government needed to control inflation by having \u201ca responsible and fair approach to pay\u201d.\n\nHe implicitly criticised Jeremy Clarkson for what he said about the Duchess of Sussex in his Sun column last week. But he did not accept that the Clarkson column showed that Britain was a racist country. Asked about Clarkson\u2019s comments, he said:\n\n\nI think for everyone in public life, language matters. You asked about racism. Now, I\u2019ve seen some of the things that have been said. I absolutely don\u2019t believe that Britain is a racist country. And I\u2019d hope that as our nation\u2019s first British Asian prime minister, when I say that it carries some weight.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.47pm GMT\n\n\n 2.12pm  \nSunak claims Rwanda policy is 'common sense position' backed by 'vast majority of public' - despite polls saying otherwise\n\nRishi Sunak has welcomed the high court judgment saying the government\u2019s Rwanda deportation policy for asylum seekers is legal. In a clip for broadcasters from Riga, he said the policy was a \u201ccommon sense position\u201d supported by \u201cthe vast majority of the British public\u201d. He said:\n\nWell, I welcome the decision of the court today. We\u2019ve always maintained that our Rwanda policy is lawful, and I\u2019m pleased that was confirmed today and this is just one part of our plan to tackle illegal migration.\nLast week, I set out a very comprehensive approach to stopping the boats from coming to the UK. It\u2019s not going to be easy and we\u2019re not going to be able to do it overnight.\nBut I\u2019m confident that with the steps I laid out last week, we really can get to grips with illegal migration, because I think what we all want to see, and what I want to deliver, is a system whereby if you come to the UK illegally, you will not have the right to stay and we will be able to return you to your own country if it\u2019s safe or a safe alternative like Rwanda.\nThat\u2019s the common sense position, I think, of the vast majority of the British public. It\u2019s my position, and that\u2019s what I want to deliver as prime minister.\n\nIn fact, ever since the Rwanda policy was announced in April, public opinion on it has always been divided. One more recent poll suggests that an alternative policy for dealing with small boats \u2013 making it easier for people to apply for asylum in the UK from overseas (broadly something Labour favours) \u2013 is more popular.\n\n\n\n\n 1.41pm  \n\nHere is some comment on the Rwanda high court judgment from lawyers and journalists on Twitter.\nDanny Shaw, the former BBC home affairs correspondent, says the judgment made \u201cgloomy reading\u201d for opponents of the Rwanda scheme.\n\n\n\n\nAdam Wagner, a human rights barrister, thinks further appeals will hold up Rwanda deportations until the election, and that ultimately no asylum seeker will ever be sent there.\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Yeo, an immigration barrister, thinks some deportations will eventually take place.\n\n<!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field -->\n<!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field -->\n<!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field -->\n<!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field -->\nAnd Sam Freedman, a commentator and fellow at the Institute for Government thinktank, thinks what the judgment says about the need for cases to be considered carefully could limit the scope for people to be sent to Rwanda in large numbers. \n\n\n\n\n 1.08pm  \nSunak urges Gary Neville to stick to football after pundit's low pay outburst prompts Tory protests\n\nRishi Sunak has joined other senior Tories who have criticised the football pundit and former England player Gary Neville for his attack on the government\u2019s nurses\u2019 pay policy yesterday.\nDuring his World Cup commentary, Neville suggested there were similarities between the government\u2019s approach to nurses and the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar. He accused ministers of \u201cdemonising rail workers, ambulance workers and terrifyingly, nurses\u201d.\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves, who was invited to accompany Sunak on his trip to Latvia, Sunak was asked about Neville\u2019s comments. He replied:\n\nI think when most people are tuning in to watch Gary Neville they want to hear about the football and watch the football. They don\u2019t want to discuss politics.\n\nSunak also said that he came from an NHS family and that as chancellor and PM he had prioritised the health service. \u201cDuring Covid when there was a pay freeze in the rest of the public sector, the one area that got special treatment was the NHS. I did that as chancellor,\u201d he said.\nOther Tories have been more blunt. This is from Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.19pm GMT\n\n\n 12.46pm  \nRefugee charities say high court judgment on Rwanda policy 'deeply disappointing'\n\nCharities that work with refugees have reacted with alarm to the high court judgment on the Rwanda policy.\nSteve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK\u2019s refugee and migrant rights director, said:\n\nThis bitterly disappointing decision draws attention to the limitations of domestic law when it comes to the UK meeting its obligations under international law.\nWe remain gravely concerned that the government\u2019s Rwanda deal seriously undermines international refugee law and rides roughshod over the rights of people seeking asylum in the UK.\n\nKaty Chakrabortty, head of policy and advocacy at Oxfam, said:\n\nThe high court\u2019s ruling is deeply disappointing. But just because something is legal, does not make it humane.\nThe government\u2019s plans to offshore our asylum responsibilities to Rwanda are cruel and immoral, and will do nothing to tackle the issue of dangerous small boat crossings. We need a reversal of this barbaric policy, and the creation of more safe and legal routes for those fleeing conflict and persecution to the UK.\n\nJosie Naughton, the CEO of Choose Love, which helped to fund the claim by Asylum Aid (one of the various cases considered by the high court in its judgment), said:\n\nToday is a dark moment for upholding human rights in the UK. Hostility has come at the expense of compassion, and the country is turning its back on the principle that all should have rights to live in freedom and in safety. Today\u2019s ruling sets a dangerous precedent for evading international and moral commitments towards those seeking asylum.\n\nAnd Beth Gardiner-Smith, the CEO of Safe Passage International, said:\n\nToday\u2019s decision is deeply disappointing, and our thoughts are with all of those who are at risk of deportation under this cruel policy. As well as being immoral, this plan won\u2019t work in practice to deter people from making dangerous journeys across the Channel as we have seen this year. Instead, it will inflict huge misery and suffering on refugees who have already experienced significant trauma.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.53pm GMT\n\n\n 12.35pm  \nLabour and Lib Dems urge government to abandon 'unworkable, unethical, expensive' Rwanda policy\n\nResponding to the high court judgment, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the government should abandon the Rwanda policy because it was unworkable and expensive. She said in a statement:\n\nThe Rwanda scheme is a damaging distraction from the urgent action the government should be taking to go after the criminal gangs and sort out the asylum system. It is unworkable, unethical, extortionately expensive.\nMinisters have already written a \u00a3140m cheque to Rwanda without the policy even starting, with millions more promised even though Home Office officials say there\u2019s no evidence it\u2019ll provide a deterrent and it risks making trafficking worse.\nThe Rwandan government has said it can only process 200 people a year \u2013 or 0.5% of Channel crossings this year.\n\nAnd the Liberal Democrats have also renewed their call for the government to abandon the policy, on the same grounds. This is from Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dems\u2019 home affair spokesperson:\n\nWhether or not it is lawful, the Conservatives\u2019 Rwanda asylum plan is immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for taxpayers.\nIt will do nothing to stop dangerous Channel crossings or combat people smuggling and human trafficking; instead it will give criminal gangs more power and profits.\nThe Conservatives are betraying the UK\u2019s proud tradition of providing sanctuary to refugees fleeing war and persecution, and breaching our commitments under the 1951 UN refugee convention.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.36pm GMT\n\n\n 12.10pm  \nBraverman says she wants to press on with Rwanda policy 'as soon as possible' in light of court judgment\n\nSuella Braverman, the home secretary, says she wants to press on with the Rwanda deportation policy \u201cas soon as possible\u201d in the light of today\u2019s court judgment. She made the comment in one of several tweets on the ruling, saying: \u201cMy focus remains on moving ahead with the policy as soon as possible and we stand ready to defend against any further legal challenge.\u201d\n\n\n\nBraverman notoriously told an event at the Tory party conference that having a Telegraph front page showing a plane with asylum seekers on it leaving the UK for Rwanda was her \u201cdream\u201d and \u201cobsession\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 12.12pm GMT\n\n\n 11.59am  \nSteve Barclay challenged about state of NHS by mother of young patient during hospital visit\n\nSteve Barclay, the health secretary, was reprimanded by a mother during a hospital visit this morning for suggesting that Covid was mainly to blame for problems with the health service.\nBarclay and other ministers have repeatedly argued that the problems facing the NHS are to a large extent caused by the impact of the pandemic.\nBut when Sarah Pinnington-Auld met Barclay as he visited as he visited King\u2019s UCollege hospital in London, she told him she was not convinced by this argument.\nAs Sky News reports, Pinnington-Auld, whose three-year-old daughter has cystic fibrosis and was being treated in the hospital, said:\n\nWe were short of doctors, we were short of beds going into the pandemic so I think it is really wrong to blame it on the pandemic.\n\nShe also said that government should be spending more on social care, and that she was concerned that Britain was moving closer to a privatised healthcare model like America\u2019s, where the rich would get a much better service than the poor.\nAccording to Sky News, Pinnington-Auld has in the past expressed her support for Labour on social media.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.04pm GMT\n\n\n 11.38am  \nPriti Patel says court judgment has vindicated her 'world-leading' Rwanda policy\n\nPriti Patel, the former home secretary who negotiated the deal with Rwanda for asylum seekers arriving in the UK to be deported there, said in a statement on Twitter that this morning\u2019s court judgment vindicates her \u201cworld-leading\u201d policy.\n\n\n\n\n 11.32am  \nWhy high court ruled Rwanda policy not incompatible with refugee convention\n\nOne of the issues considered by the high court was whether the government\u2019s Rwanda policy was incompatible with the UK\u2019s obligations under the UN refugee convention, as many campaigners have claimed. Here is paragraph 121 from the full judgment, which explains why this argument was rejected.\n\nMr Drabble KC [who was representing two of the asylum seekers threatened with deportation] submitted that the refugee convention imposes an obligation on contracting states to determine all asylum claims made, on their merits. We disagree. There is no such obligation on the face of the convention. The obligation that is imposed is the one at article 33, not to expel or return a refugee to a place where his life or freedom would be threatened by reason of any of the characteristics that the convention protects. Mr Drabble\u2019s submission was that an obligation to determine asylum claims would be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the convention and could therefore reasonably be assumed. Again, we disagree. Obligations in international treaties are formulated with considerable care. They reflect balances struck following detailed negotiations between states parties. An obligation to determine every asylum claim on its merits would be a significant addition to the refugee convention. There is no reason to infer the existence of an obligation of that order; to do so would go well beyond the limits of any notion of judicial construction of an international agreement; and the protection that is necessary if the purpose of the convention is to be met, is provided by article 33.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.35am GMT\n\n\n 11.12am  \n\nAnd the Migration Observatory, a group at Oxford University that studies migration policy, says that just because the Rwanda policy has been judged lawful, that does not mean it will be effective.\n\n\n\n\n 11.10am  \n\nThe Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has posted a series of tweets saying it will continue to oppose the government\u2019s plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda regardless of today\u2019s high court judgment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.05am  \n\nThe Refugee Council has said it is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the high court judgment on the Rwanda policy. In a statement, Enver Solomon, its chief executive, said:\n\nWe are very disappointed in the outcome of this case. If the government moves ahead with these harmful plans, it would damage the UK\u2019s reputation as a country that values human rights, and undermine our commitment to provide safety to those fleeing conflict and oppression, as enshrined in the 1951 refugee convention.\nTreating people who are in search of safety like human cargo and shipping them off to another country is a cruel policy that will cause great human suffering. The scheme is wrong in principle and unworkable in practice. The possibility of being sent off to Rwanda is causing huge distress to those we work with, including young people who are becoming extremely anxious and in some cases self-harming.\nIt is a hugely expensive policy that is unlikely to reach the scale claimed by the government. The Home Office\u2019s own evidence shows that deterrence measures such as this simply don\u2019t work \u2013 they just force people to take ever more dangerous journeys. It also poses serious safeguarding risks, particularly for children and vulnerable individuals.\nInstead of outsourcing our international commitment to provide safe haven to those fleeing for their lives \u2013 including people from Ukraine and Afghanistan \u2013 we should be focusing on operating an orderly, humane and fair asylum system, and developing safe routes such as humanitarian visas.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.07am GMT\n\n\n 11.02am  \n\nHere is our story on the high court judgment, from my colleagues Rajeev Syal and Diane Taylor.\n\n\n\n\n 10.54am  \nSending asylum seekers to Rwanda 'consistent with refugee convention and Human Rights Act', says high court\n\nAnd here is the key quote from the summary of the judgment.\n\nThe court has concluded that, it is lawful for the government to make arrangements for relocating asylum seekers to Rwanda and for their asylum claims to be determined in Rwanda rather than in the United Kingdom. On the evidence before this court, the government has made arrangements with the government of Rwanda which are intended to ensure that the asylum claims of people relocated to Rwanda are properly determined in Rwanda. In those circumstances, the relocation of asylum seekers to Rwanda is consistent with the refugee convention and with the statutory and other legal obligations on the government including the obligations imposed by the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.00am GMT\n\n\n 10.48am  \n\nHere is the press summary of the judgment.\nAnd here is the full 139-page ruling.\n\n\n\n 10.47am  \n\nHere is a link to the high court judgment in the Rwanda case.\n\nUpdated at 10.48am GMT\n\n\n 10.46am  \n\nThese are from Joshua Rozenberg, the legal commentator, on the high court judgment. He says the court said the Home Office did not properly consider the circumstances of eight people facing deportation, but that the policy itself is lawful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.40am  \nGovernment plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda are lawful, high court rules\n\nPA Media has just snapped this.\n\nGovernment plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda are lawful, the high court has ruled.\n\nI will post more on this when I get it.\nThe ruling is likely to be appealed, so this won\u2019t be the end of the matter, but this still looks like a significant win for the government.\n\nUpdated at 10.42am GMT\n\n\n 10.30am  \nHunt says next budget to take place on Wednesday 15 March\n\nOne of the many peculiar features of 2022 was that although the Treasury made multiple budget-style announcements, including Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget, we have not had a proper budget all year. In March, when Rishi Sunak was chancellor, he delivered a spring statement, not a budget. And Jeremy Hunt\u2019s most recent tax and spending announcement was formally billed as an autumn statement.\nBut we will get a formal budget in the spring, Hunt has announced. In a written statement, the chancellor said:\n\nToday I can inform the house that I have asked the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to prepare a forecast for 15 March 2023 to accompany a spring budget.\nThis forecast, in addition to the forecast that took place in November 2022, will fulfil the obligation for the OBR to produce at least two forecasts in a financial year, as is required by legislation.\n\nThis will be the first formal budget since October 2021.\n\nUpdated at 10.38am GMT\n\n\n 10.04am  \n\nLabour has renewed its call for the government to open talks with the health unions on pay. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told Times Radio this morning:\n\nI think everybody is deeply concerned about NHS staff on strike and the impact that will have on patient care. That is why we want these strikes averted.\nThat is why it is incumbent upon ministers to actually engage now in a meaningful negotiation in order to avoid these strikes.\nThe buck stops with Rishi Sunak and his government. They\u2019re the ones who can stop these strikes by engaging in a meaningful negotiation about what is a fair settlement for NHS staff.\n\n\n\n\n 9.54am  \nNHS faces 'incredibly challenging and disrupted week' because of strikes, says health leader\n\nNegotiations between ambulance service leaders and unions are still continuing over exactly what services will be maintained during Wednesday\u2019s strike in England and Wales, the interim chief executive of NHS Providers, Saffron Cordery, told BBC Breakfast this morning.\nNHS Providers represents NHS trusts, and Cordery said talks were taking place at national level and local level.\nAsked if people would have to make their own way to hospital, she replied:\n\nIf someone has a life and limb emergency, they should call 999. And if it\u2019s not that kind of emergency, they will be told to seek different advice.\nIf they think they\u2019ve got the kind of emergency where they would usually call 111, then they should do that, or they should consult a GP or pharmacist. They must use the usual routes available to them and take that advice. There may well be alternative advice available to them that wouldn\u2019t ordinarily be the case.\nSo perhaps they will be advised to get themselves to hospital, but they should wait to seek that medical advice.\n\nCordery also said it would be an \u201cincredibly challenging and disrupted week\u201d for the NHS because there was another strike by nurses too. She told BBC Breakfast:\n\nThis is going to be an incredibly challenging and disrupted week, not only because we have the ambulance service coming out on strike across nearly every region, but also because we\u2019ve got these sequential strikes.\nSo we\u2019ve got nurses\u2019 industrial action on Tuesday, and then ambulance services on Wednesday, and I think one will impact the other.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.05am GMT\n\n\n 9.47am  \nSunak arrives in Latvia for summit with fellow leaders from JEF military partnership\n\nRishi Sunak has touched down in the Latvian capital, where he is meeting northern European allies to discuss countering Russian aggression, PA Media reports.

We\u2019re in the final week before Christmas, and the strikes affecting public services are set to get even more serious. Last week\u2019s strike by the Royal College of Nursing was unprecedented, because the RCN had never called a strike before, but ministers fear that a strike by ambulance staff in England and Wales on Wednesday could be even more serious because of the impact it will have on patients needing emergency care.\nAs Jessica Elgot and Andrew Gregory report in their overnight story, Steve Barclay, the health secretary, has signalled that he is open to further talks in the hope of averting this week\u2019s strike.\nBut this morning the leaders of Britain\u2019s two biggest unions, Unison and Unite, which represent ambulance staff, have played down the prospect of any meaningful talks happening, saying the government\u2019s refusal to discuss pay is making discussion pointless.\nIn an interview with the Daily Mirror, Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said it was Barclay himself who was holding the country to ransom. She said:\n\nLook at Scotland. The government there came back to the negotiating table, made a new offer and the strikes were cancelled. Yet in England they refuse to negotiate a new deal with the unions or go back to the pay review body.\nIt\u2019s Steve Barclay who is holding the country to ransom. He will have to carry the can if patients suffer because he thinks this is his Thatcher moment.\n\nAnd on the Today programme this morning Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary, said ministers were being impossible. She said:\n\nThe government has been completely intransigent here. We\u2019ve been calling on them for weeks and weeks to talk to us about this, to actually sit down and have a proper discussion before we try and resolve this dispute, and they have adamantly refused to do that.\nI don\u2019t know how much stronger myself, or Pat Cullen [the RCN general secretary] or Gary Smith of the GMB [need to be] \u2013 all of us are saying the same thing, we are prepared to talk to you, but they will not talk to us about the elephant in the room, which is pay.\n\nMcAnea said she last met Barclay herself five weeks ago, for about 15 minutes. She said there was \u201cno trust left\u201d between unions and the government and that, for Wednesday\u2019s ambulance strike to be called off, ministers would have to promise to open negotiations on pay. She said:\n\nIt has be a very firm commitment. There is no trust left between us and the government. They would have to come up with something more that was more than just \u2018Let\u2019s talk about this\u2019 for us to call off the strike on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, the ambulance strike is not the only public service strike coming this week. Here is the advent calendar of strikes for this month.\n\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n10.30am: The high court delivers judgments in legal challenges to the government\u2019s Rwanda deportation policy.\nMorning: Rishi Sunak arrives in Riga, Latvia, for a meeting of leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force, the UK-led defence group mostly made up of Nordic and Baltic countries. Later he will go to Estonia to meet British troops stationed there.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n2.30pm: Suella Braverman, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.\nI\u2019ll try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.\nIf you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.

These were the day\u2019s big developments:  Labor is on track to secure more than 51 out of 88 seats in the Victorian lower house, six more than required to govern in majority. The Coalition is projected to win at least 25 seats and the Greens \u2013 who are eyeing balance of power in the upper house \u2013 at least four. Matthew Guy announced he would step down as Victorian Liberal leader after Saturday\u2019s crushing defeat, with the party now turning its mind to who will replace him. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, called on Scott Morrison to apologise for signing himself on to multiple ministries. The federal government struck a deal with the independent senator David Pocock to pass its industrial relations bill in return for a boost to safeguards for small and medium businesses and regular reviews of the adequacy of welfare payments.  Thanks, as always, for joining us. I hope you enjoy the remainder of your weekend.  Updated at 6.48am GMT    6.30am    The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of New South Wales.   Updated at 6.34am GMT    6.21am    Labor has won 51 seats so far in Victorian election AAP has the provisional leaderboard in the Victorian state election as of 5pm AEDT. With counting still under way, the Labor party has won 51 seats, the Liberal party 16, the National party nine and the Greens four. The seats projected to change hands are Glen Waverley (Liberal to Labor), Mildura (independent to Nationals), Morwell (independent to Nationals), Nepean (Labor to Liberal), Richmond (Labor to Greens), Shepparton (independent to Nationals). Among the seats yet to be called are Hastings (Labor ahead of Liberal), Mornington (Liberal ahead of independent) and Northcote (Labor ahead of Greens).  Updated at 6.35am GMT    6.01am    As her forecast \u201cGreenslide\u201d failed to materialise, the Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, turned her attention to hopes the party can hold the balance of power in the upper house to influence a returned Daniel Andrews government. Read more from my colleague Adeshola Ore here:   Updated at 6.06am GMT    5.37am    Labor could finish one seat ahead of \u2018Danslide\u2019 As Daniel Andrews strolled into the history books, Matthew Guy quietly made the call to walk away from the Liberal leadership after another Victorian election drubbing. Labor is on track to win more than 51 of the 88 seats in the lower house after yesterday\u2019s poll, six more than the number required to govern in majority. The Coalition is projected to win at least 25 seats after starting the count with 27 and the Greens a minimum of four. Seven seats remained too close to call as of this afternoon, although Labor was predicted to win or was ahead in five of those. If it takes all five, Labor will finish one seat ahead of its \u201cDanslide\u201d 2018 election victory result despite a plunge in its primary vote and double-digit swings against it in Melbourne\u2019s north and west. \u2013 AAP  Updated at 5.57am GMT    5.17am    It looks as though Labor will hang on to Melton, according to the ABC. Labor are also on on track to hold Albert Park despite a challenge from the Greens, who ended up finishing third in the count.   Updated at 5.58am GMT    4.53am    Man charged after pedestrian allegedly hit by hearse in inner-west Sydney A pedestrian is fighting for his life in hospital after being hit by a hearse last night in Sydney\u2019s inner west. The driver of the Mazda hearse allegedly fled the scene before emergency services arrived about 8.50pm. Paramedics treated the 61-year-old pedestrian at the scene before taking him to hospital in a critical condition. The hearse driver, 21, attended Newtown police station later in the night, when he was arrested. Police seized the hearse in Five Dock and charged the man with multiple driving offences, including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. He was refused bail and was due to appear in court today. \u2013 AAP  Updated at 5.09am GMT    4.39am    Good afternoon, this is Lisa Cox taking over from Royce Kurmelovs who has done a fantastic job taking us through the Victorian election wash-up. I\u2019ll be here with all of your afternoon updates.  Updated at 5.02am GMT    4.30am    Student doctors to help relieve pressure on NSW hospitals More than 1,000 NSW final-year medical students will be working in hospitals in paid positions to reduce pressure on a health system still battered by Covid-19. Premier Dominic Perrottet said the assistant in medicine (AiM) initiative was introduced in 2020 as a temporary workforce surge measure during the pandemic but was so successful, it made sense for it to continue. He told reporters today:  This Australian-first program is good for students, good for hospital workers and it\u2019s great for patients.  Perrottet said the pilot program had expanded from 400 part-time positions to 1,100 final-year medical students who have been placed across regional and metropolitan hospitals as part of the state\u2019s $33bn investment in health. Regional health minister Bronnie Taylor said the program allows \u201cmedical students who are highly qualified ... to get into the system fast ... and to have a really significant role\u201d. The announcement comes on the back of pharmacists being authorised by the government to administer a wider range of vaccinations. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has slammed the move as \u201cmadness\u201d and \u201ca recipe for disaster\u201d. Dr Jose Arguelles, who underwent the AiM program, said the initiative provided hands-on training and enabled future doctors to navigate the health system by taking on patient care:  You\u2019re given a set of responsibilities coming in day in and day out and learning about these patients \u2013 that\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s a human job as well. We\u2019re not just robots.  A Bureau of Health Information survey, released this month, reported that NSW hospitals were less organised, their staff were not working together effectively and the care being provided was not as good. It asked more than 19,000 adult patients to rate the care they received throughout 2021. The results showed worse outcomes than the 2020 survey. More than one in five patients reported receiving contradictory information about their condition or how it would be treated. \u2013 AAP  Updated at 5.11am GMT    4.15am    Victorian Liberals eye up leadership options after election defeat With Victorian Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, announcing he will step down following a resounding election loss, the party is now turning its mind to who can replace him. Several Liberal MPs have told Guardian Australia Warrandyte MP Ryan Smith has been canvassing support for a leadership bid, as has Berwick MP Brad Battin and the party\u2019s Hawthorn candidate, John Pesutto. The seat of Hawthorn remains on a knife edge between Pesutto and a \u201cteal\u201d independent, Melissa Lowe. Lowe was ahead on election night but Pesutto edged ahead today off the back of postal votes. With 70% of the vote counted, Pesutto leads by 480 votes. Pessuto, considered a future leader of the Liberals, previously held the seat between 2014 and 2018 before he lost it unexpectedly at the \u201cDanslide\u201d election. Another possible contender for the leadership is Matt Bach, the party\u2019s shadow transport infrastructure minister, though this would require a move from the upper to the lower house.  Updated at 4.26am GMT    4.00am    Mixed review of new economic inclusion advisory panel The Australian Council of Social Services has welcomed an announcement that an economic inclusion advisory panel will be created to report publicly on issues such as the rate of income support ahead of federal budgets. The panel will be led by the treasurer and social services minister and will aim to bring together experts, advocacy groups and peak bodies. Acoss CEO Dr Cassandra Goldie said the body would help address the \u201cstructural issues in our income support system that entrenches poverty\u201d:  We welcome the government\u2019s commitment to hear from the experts on these issues in the lead up to May 2023 and future budgets. Importantly, this should include the voices of people who are experts by experience, people with direct experience of poverty and income supports. It will be crucial that the government acts on the Committee\u2019s recommendations, which will no doubt shine a light on the inadequacy of JobSeeker and related payments to meet essential costs. We know the inadequacy of these payments forces people to go without food and without essential medicines, and that an adequate increase to income support payments is needed urgently right now. People on JobSeeker and other income support payments are suffering poor health, losing their homes, and going without other basic goods and services because no one can survive on $48 a day. We cannot let this continue now, and we cannot end up here again.  The proposal, however, has not been well received among anti-poverty activists who have been campaigning for years to raise social security payments.Kristin O\u2019Connell from the Anti-Poverty Centre said the proposal was a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d solution that was \u201cat best pointless, at worst, harmful\u201d:  The only people it serves are those who want to perform empathy for folks on welfare. Doing this without an independent determined poverty line is inviting disaster.  She said immediate action could be taken by lifting payments now but the government has so far asked welfare to wait at least another year \u201cfor the sake of budget\u201d.  Updated at 4.06am GMT    3.45am    Nervous wait for inflation data before interest rate decision A key consumer price index will be closely watched for a further inflation spike as the Reserve Bank weighs up yet another cash rate hike. The CPI release on Wednesday will be only the second time the Australian Bureau of Statistics has issued a monthly rather than quarterly inflation figure. The index rose 7.3% in the 12 months to September \u2013 the highest rise in more than three decades \u2013 after significant increases in the costs of housing, food and transport. The annual inflation rate is expected to hit 8% by the end of the year. The RBA meets for the final time this year on 6 December, when it is expected to hike rates again as it seeks to get inflation back to its target band of between 2% and 3%. CoreLogic\u2019s national index of house prices will be released on Thursday and CommBank economists expect it to show a monthly fall in prices of about 1%. On Friday, the ABS will issue its lending indicators report for October, which is expected to show an increase in the value of home loans. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe will take part in a panel discussion hosted by the Bank of Thailand in Bangkok on the same day. - AAP  Updated at 4.08am GMT    3.27am   IR law will lead to \u2018chaos and confusion\u2019, Michaelia Cash says  Michaelia Cash has attacked the government\u2019s IR bill, saying the amendments negotiated by senator David Pocock and others amount to little more than \u201ctinkering around the edges\u201d. Speaking to reporters in parliament today, Cash said the bill would compel employers into an agreement and would lead to \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d:  What you have today is a deal has been struck and the legislation will pass. The employers of Australia, the employers who create the jobs today, remain united. I have one last plea to Mr Albanese and that is please listen to the job creators in this country. It is going to be a really rough Christmas for so many employers out there.  Cash said she wanted the government to hold off on passing the bill over the Christmas break to talk to employers. She also said the proposed law would \u201cfundamentally take away the right of the employer and the employee to negotiate terms and conditions\u201d between each other. On the prospect that the government may move to censure Scott Morrison following the findings of the Bell report, Cash said she would \u201cwait and see\u201d what decision will be made tomorrow.  Updated at 4.26am GMT    3.15am    Proposed new IR law gives workers hope, ACTU says ACTU secretary Sally McManus has welcomed the announcement that Labor\u2019s industrial relations bill is likely to pass the Senate. McManus said the law would benefit women in sectors like aged care by improving their pay and conditions:  This gives people hope. It gives people hope that we can start unwinding the large numbers of insecure jobs that we have in this country.   Updated at 3.36am GMT    2.58am    PM defends plan for an economic inclusion advisory committee Anthony Albanese rejects criticism suggesting the proposed economic inclusion advisory committee is \u201ckicking the can down the road\u201d on a decision to raise jobseeker, as the body will have no power to actually push through a rise in the payments:  This is an important process being established that will assist government decision making but will also assist transparency. I take David Pocock at his word, as I do with others as well.  A final question now on whether the government will act to bring down gas prices.  Albanese says the government \u201cwill be having further discussions\u201d on whether it will intervene in the federal gas market. He says it aims to make a decision before Christmas and \u201cthis remains the timetable\u201d.  Updated at 3.37am GMT    2.53am   Albanese calls on Morrison to apologise for secret ministries  Anthony Albanese says former prime minister Scott Morrison should apologise for signing himself into multiple ministries and in light of the findings of the Bell inquiry. Asked about the results, Albanese would not be drawn on whether parliament would vote to censure Morrison:  You had a shadow government operating in an unprecedented, extraordinary way. You had a prime minister who was standing up in parliament and not telling, not telling his own side, or not all of his side knew, let alone the parliament as a whole, who held what portfolio and who was responsible for decisions. There\u2019s a reason why, under the Westminster system, ministers are held accountable by the parliament. It wasn\u2019t possible to hold the ministers to account because people didn\u2019t know who the ministers were. The parliament is likely to want to express a view on that and we will have a discussion of it and we will let you know once that decision is made.  Albanese says he has yet to see an apology from the former prime minister:  Our democracy requires, I think, deserves an apology for this. I didn\u2019t see any contrition in Scott Morrison\u2019s statement last Friday, and I find that just extraordinary that anyone could read the Bell inquiry and not be embarrassed if you\u2019re the subject of it. It\u2019s also the case that Scott Morrison said he\u2019d fully cooperate with the inquiry, but he chose to talk with his lawyers, through his lawyers. And that of course is his right to do but I\u2019ll leave people to draw their own conclusions there.   Updated at 3.34am GMT    2.48am    Any payment increases subject to the state of the budget After some questions about commentary on the Victorian election, Anthony Albanese is brought back to the question of whether social security payments will rise. The question is that his comments just now are the clearest indicator that jobseeker payments will rise at the next budget. Albanese, however, waters this down and says his comments are \u201cconsistent\u201d with what he has said previously: that any decision will be subject to the state of the budget:  Each and every budget, Labor will consider what we can do to provide further assistance to people but we\u2019ll do so in the context of the economic circumstances that we face. So we\u2019ll do so responsibly. I would always want to do more for people who are disadvantaged \u2013 that\u2019s the Labor way. We don\u2019t like seeing situations whereby people are doing it tough, but what we know is that we need to be responsible.  Albanese says though his government would have liked to have done more, they had to \u201cdo the right and economically responsible thing, which is to return 99% of the revenue growth that had occurred to the budget because that\u2019s what the economy needed at that the point in time\u201d.  Updated at 3.54am GMT    2.44am    Albanese won\u2019t guarantee social security payments will rise The first question is about the commitment from the government to establish an economic inclusion advisory committee. Albanese is asked if he accepts as true that one in six Australian children live in poverty and if so, why a committee is necessary when immediate action could be taken. Albanese:  Government will continue to make decisions, but it should make decisions based upon the best possible advice, putting out the facts there, which this committee will be able to do. There are a range of other sources of advice. This will be an additional one. We know that I said before the election repeated again: there\u2019s more I would like to do.  The prime minister however did not go so far as to guarantee that social security payments will rise and said there were \u201cfiscal constraints\u201d.  We do have to make sure that any action of the government bears in mind inflation and the economic circumstances, which are there. This committee I think will add to the amount of information and the quality of the information which is out there.   Updated at 2.50am GMT    2.41am    IR law will \u2018get wages moving\u2019, Burke says Tony Burke says the IR bill, if passed, will help get wages moving after a decade of stagnation:  The decision that gets taken this week means that we will have a pathway to secure jobs we will get wages moving and we will be taking action to close the gender pay gap. We have legislation where every section of the bill is still there. There are amendments which improve it in various ways. But the bottom line is there will be a pathway now for wages to get moving again in Australia. It\u2019ll be a deliberate design feature of how we manage things.  Now we\u2019re going to questions.  Updated at 6.23am GMT    2.39am    Decade of low wages result of \u2018bad policy\u2019, PM says Anthony Albanese has congratulated both Daniel Andrews and the Socceroos for their wins overnight, with the prime minister saying the Victorian premier and his team deserve \u201ca great big pat on the back\u201d. The PM praises Andrews for laying out a positive vision for what his government will do for Victoria in a sometimes heated campaign. On the proposed industrial relations bill, Albanese also thanks David Pocock for his negotiations on the bill:  We went through an election saying that we wanted to get wages moving again. We said that the low wages that we\u2019ve seen over the previous decade wasn\u2019t a result of bad luck. That was bad policy. The former government said that low wage growth was a design feature of their economic architecture. And they certainly delivered that low wages for year after year after year. This is a sensitive proposition and Labor has been prepared to sit down with business, with unions, with the crossbench, with civil society to work through the legislation to ensure that any improvements can be offered have been taken up.  Albanese says this method will define its approach to future legislation.  Updated at 6.23am GMT    2.20am    Business groups claim proposed IR law will take Australia back to the 1970s The Australian Industry Group says Labor\u2019s proposed industrial relations law will lead to more conflict, complexity and uncertainty. Innes Willox, the chief executive of the national employer association, said the bill did not address business concerns, saying it \u201cshattered\u201d the system that has operated for the last four decades and warned of a return to the 1970s:  The primacy of the enterprise agreement system which has underpinned much of our economic success over the past four decades has now been shattered. There is nothing in the deal or the legislation that will drive the substantial productivity growth Australia needs to deliver wages growth. We now truly face a return to a 1970s industrial model, entirely unsuited to the 21st-century open and productive economy we need. The ramifications of the proposals on employment, investment and business certainty will be far-reaching. We now face the prospect of more strikes and fewer jobs. There has been no modelling on any economic benefit of the legislation, only the vague hope that employers with an industrial gun to their head will pay more and somehow not pass costs on to consumers or reduce their headcount. Of the concessions agreed to by the government, there is very little improvement for the vast bulk of Australian businesses. They largely amount to tinkering around the edges of what at its heart remains a fundamentally flawed bill.  Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar said his organisation appreciated efforts by senator David Pocock to consult \u201cin good faith\u201d but believed the bill is \u201cfundamentally flawed and simply cannot be improved through the amendments that are now proposed\u201d. McKellar said his organisation remained opposed to the bill:  The bill, as it stands, will do nothing to achieve the aim of increasing wages, and will only add cost and complexity to Australian businesses at a time when they are dealing with deteriorating conditions. Ultimately, this bill represents a fundamental delinkage of wages with productivity and will detract from the flexibility and dynamism required by modern economies. We remain of the view that this bill is not fit for passage.   Updated at 6.26am GMT    2.11am    IR bill not ready to pass, peak construction body says Master Builders Australia has welcomed changes to Labor\u2019s proposed industrial relations reforms but is disappointed the Australian Building and Construction Commission is still facing the axe. The industry group\u2019s CEO Denita Wawn acknowledged Senator David Pocock\u2019s \u201cefforts to engage with the business community over this short timeframe\u201d but said the organisation remained opposed to the bill in its current form and \u201curges the Senate to not rush this through\u201d:  The building and construction industry welcomes the proposed expansion of a carve-out for civil construction but concerns remain for various subcontractors within the sector, including electricians, plumbers and metal workers. Builders don\u2019t operate in an economic silo and while many have been spared from multi-employer bargaining, they will still experience impacts from disruptions along the supply chain. If industries like shipping, transport, warehousing and logistics are adversely impacted by multi-employer bargaining, then so will building and construction. You can\u2019t build things if the products you need are caught up in a ports strike, can\u2019t be delivered due to transport strikes, can\u2019t be accessed due to logistics strikes, or can\u2019t be obtained because of a manufacturing strike. It is disappointing there were no amendments agreed to around the abolition of the ABCC despite glaring observations made in the recent Senate inquiry around culture and unlawful conduct in the sector.   Updated at 6.26am GMT    2.00am    Greens expect to hold balance of power in Victoria\u2019s upper house The Victorian Greens say they are confident they will hold the balance of power in the state parliament\u2019s upper house. The Greens seized the historically safe Labor seat of Richmond \u2013 held by the party since 1958 \u2013 on Saturday night. But the Labor-held seats of Northcote and Albert Park, which the Greens believed were winnable, are too close to call. In the upper house, the party is hopeful it could double or quadruple its representation, where the minor party this term has just one MP. The Greens had hoped to hold the balance of power if there was a minority government, but Labor has secured enough seats in the lower house to govern with a majority. The party\u2019s leader Samantha Ratnam said holding the balance of power in the upper house was crucial to deliver reform on climate change and housing affordability:  We\u2019re willing to work constructively and cooperatively with this Labor government to get really progressive reform.  Ratnam declared the result a \u201cGreenslide\u201d last night, despite the party\u2019s primary vote now being lower than its 2010 and 2014 results. She was asked about this at today\u2019s press conference:  I\u2019ve seen really significant two-party-preferred swings to the Greens in a number of areas across Melbourne. Our sitting MPs have been rewarded with a huge vote of confidence from their electorates because they\u2019ve been working so hard to support their electorates for years on end. We know the count is still continuing. There\u2019s still races that are too close to call, but this is a strong result for the Greens.   Updated at 6.24am GMT    1.59am    Prime minister Anthony Albanese is expected to give a presser at 1.30pm.  Updated at 6.24am GMT    1.46am    Victorians have backed \u2018most ambitious climate change agenda\u2019 yet The head of Environment Victoria has described the re-election of the Andrews Labor government as an endorsement of the \u201cmost ambitious climate change agenda in Australian political history\u201d. Environment Victoria CEO Jono La Nauze said the result showed voters did not want an \u201ceach way bet\u201d on climate change and demonstrated \u201cwhat\u2019s possible\u201d following community-led efforts to address climate change within the state:  The Andrews government pledged to close all remaining coal power stations by 2035, build massive amounts of offshore wind and large-scale batteries, and cut Victoria\u2019s emissions by up to 80% by 2035 \u2013 and voters gave this plan a resounding yes. The centrepiece of Labor\u2019s election campaign was a promise to invest in publicly owned renewable energy through a revived State Electricity Commission, and last night\u2019s result shows voters will reward governments willing to take the fight to big polluting energy companies. In the SEC, Victoria has the chance to show Australia what a good energy company looks like \u2013 one that acts in the public interest and delivers clean affordable energy for all. Renewable energy will transform Victoria\u2019s economy and it is important this transition benefits everyone, including the First Nations on whose country every wind turbine, solar panel and transmission line will be built. In taking the driver\u2019s seat in Victoria\u2019s renewable revolution, the Andrews government has the opportunity to always seek First Nations consent and ensure they receive a share of the wealth generated from renewable energy projects on their land. And given the SEC helped dig the mines in the Latrobe Valley, we\u2019d like to see the same commitment to cleaning them up as there is for government-owned energy. If done right, the enormous task of rehabilitating the scars left by a century of coalmining can bring jobs and an improved environment to the Latrobe Valley community.  La Nauze also said the strong result for the Greens and teal independents would pressure the Andrew government to \u201cbring forward its closure date\u201d for native forest logging.  Updated at 6.27am GMT    1.31am    Lenders offering better deals for electric cars as end of petrol cars in sight Less than eight years from now, the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in at least nine countries. A further 10 nations, including China and Japan, will join them by 2035. By 2040, experts say, new petrol cars will be significantly harder to find around the world as manufacturers face increasing pressure to stop production. In the face of these depreciating assets, some financial institutions are withdrawing from the traditional car market to only offer electric and hybrid car loans. Others offer significant discounts for loans on low- or no-emission cars. More than 20 Australian lenders, including Westpac, Macquarie and RACQ, now offer lower rates for loans on electric vehicles, including discounts of more than one percentage point in some cases. Bank Australia took the trend one step further this year, announcing it would no longer offer car loans for new petrol, diesel or hybrid vehicles by 2025. The company\u2019s impact management head, Jane Kern, says the bank created the policy after feedback from its customers and considerations of the vehicle market and its climate impact:  We think supporting customers to buy electric vehicles makes a lot of sense, both financially, because of the running cost of electric vehicles, but also because of the future vehicle value.  Kern adds that reaction to the bank\u2019s announcement has been largely positive and she hopes other financial institutions will follow its lead. Swinburne University professor Hussein Dia says despite Australia\u2019s slow uptake of electric vehicles, there is soaring interest in the technology and a growing acceptance petrol and diesel vehicles will soon be phased out:  Many people recognise today that their investment in petrol vehicles [will depreciate]. In 10 to 15 years\u2019 time, even if someone wanted to buy a petrol vehicle, I don\u2019t think they would be able to find a new one on the market because car manufacturers are under a lot of pressure to stop producing and selling petrol and diesel vehicles. China, India, the UK, France: there is a long list of countries that have policies in place to ban the production and sale of petrol vehicles by 2030 to 2040.  \u2013 AAP  Updated at 4.17am GMT    1.15am    Pocock confirms push to increase jobseeker payments in return for support on IR bill The ACT independent senator, David Pocock, has spoken to reporters in Canberra about his deal to help pass Labor\u2019s IR bill in return for safeguards for small businesses and a new committee to conduct ongoing reviews of the adequacy of welfare payments. Asked if he\u2019d asked for payments to be increased, Pocock appeared to confirm he had:  I\u2019ve been pushing them on jobseeker since I started meeting with relevant ministers and the treasurer. It makes no sense to me for one of the wealthiest countries in the world to have one in six children growing up in poverty. That\u2019s not good for all of our collective [community and] I\u2019ll continue to push them on. Having this independent committee, I think will raise awareness about the state of social security payments in Australia and hopefully will really push the government to address it.  Asked if he expects the committee to flow through to jobseeker, Pocock said:  That\u2019s my hope. They\u2019ll publish their recommendations at least two weeks before the budget. So, there\u2019ll be a level of transparency there and then government will have to make the case of why they are or aren\u2019t taking those recommendations on board.  Pocock \u2013 who has previously linked his vote to wiping the ACT\u2019s public housing debt \u2013 ruled out that further measures might be coming in return for his vote. He told reporters \u201cthis is the whole deal\u201d and rejected any suggestion it amounts to horse trading:  I\u2019ve been pushing to make this bill as good as it can be. I\u2019ve been taking concerns raised with me by various stakeholders, employers and workers, and we\u2019ve landed with a better, improved bill.   Updated at 1.45am GMT    1.04am    Electric vehicle fair held in Peter Dutton\u2019s electorate An EV fair has been held in federal opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s electorate today, with electric cars, motorbikes, bicycles, scooters and trucks on display. The display has been organised by energy advocates Solar Citizens to promote zero-emissions transport at John Scott Park in Samford Village in the seat of Dickson. Solar Citizens national director Heidi Douglas said those who turn out will have an opportunity to ask questions, take test rides and enjoy a cooking demonstration from celebrity chef Alastair McLeod on an EV-powered barbecue:  We\u2019re running this event off the back of an extremely successful consultation for the first national electric vehicle strategy \u2013 where our community members made over 600 submissions, calling for strong fuel efficiency standards to address the national shortage of EVs. There\u2019s a clear demand in the community for EVs, but we\u2019re just not getting enough of them into the country. People know they can save big bucks by making the switch to an EV \u2013 if only they could get access to them. Rooftop solar is very popular in Queensland and by charging your EV from home solar during the day you can basically run your vehicle for free. With fuel and energy prices rocketing, now is the time for Australians to be able to harness our abundant sunshine to save our hip pocket.    Updated at 4.09am GMT    12.50am    Socceroos jubilant after World Cup match win The Socceroos have marked their first World Cup victory in 12 years after Australia beat Tunisia in its World Cup group match. A header by Mitch Duke secured the 1-0 win last night at Al Janoub Stadium in Qatar. The win means the Socceroos have recorded their first clean sheet at the World Cup since 1974 and moves Australia into second place behind France in Group D. Coach Graham Arnold was taking a cautious approach after the win. He said \u201cthe nation is extremely proud\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019ll be a few hangovers in the morning\u201d but has warned his team not to become overconfident. Australia squares off against Denmark on Thursday and needs to win or draw \u2013 and for France to beat Tunisia \u2013 to make it through to the next round.  Updated at 5.14am GMT    12.35am    Flooding to persist across much of Australia Multiple catchments holding months of heavy rainfall paint an unfortunate picture of continued flooding for regional communities in NSW, Victoria and South Australia. As NSW enters the 74th day of its flood crisis, dozens of emergency warnings remain in place across Australia\u2019s east and flood peaks continue to wreak havoc around inland rivers. Locals have pulled together to protect their homes and keep the beers flowing in the tiny NSW town of Moulamein despite the swollen Edward River cutting all access roads and isolating the community. Residents were told to shelter in place on Tuesday by the State Emergency Service, with the river reaching 6.2 metres and continuing to rise last night. It\u2019s expected the tiny town of about 500 will remain cut off through to December. Overnight NSW SES performed one flood rescue and fielded 90 requests for assistance after it had issued a dozen emergency warnings including for renewed flooding in Condobolin and Euabalong. The Lachlan River has slowly begun to fall but remains above record levels set in 1952. Flooding is also affecting the nearby towns of Jemalong and Hillston, where water is not expected to recede until next week. The far-west towns of Hay and Balranald towards the Victorian border have also been hit with major floods, with the Murrumbidgee River set to peak next week. A dozen emergency warnings were in place in NSW on Saturday afternoon, while 71 areas were the subject of watch-and-act alerts. Victorians living around parts of the Murray River have also been told to prepare to evacuate as a peak approaches the north-western towns of Colignan, Nangiloc, Iraak and Lambert Island. VicEmergency sai:  Flooding will last for many weeks in this area, as the Murray River will rise, peak and fall very slowly.  Major flooding is also occurring on the Murray at Boundary Bend above the historic levels seen in 1975. In SA, flood warnings have also been issued for parts of the upper and lower Murray River. The river is expected to hit an early peak in December, before peaking again at higher levels towards Christmas. \u2013 AAP  Updated at 5.13am GMT    12.21am    Resources industry urges Andrews to embrace gas amid renewables push Australia\u2019s oil and gas industry has congratulated Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on his re-election but has \u201curged\u201d a returned Labor government to drill for more gas. The government has promised to revitalise public ownership of the State Electricity Commission with a $1bn fund to drive renewable energy projects and government ownership enshrined in the state\u2019s constitution. It is part of an ambitious agenda on climate change and energy by the returned government that plans to increase renewable energy targets \u2013 from 50% to 65% by 2030, and to 95% by 2035. It has also taken early steps towards moving away from fossil fuels with an ambitious plan to stop gas connections on new homes. Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association chief executive Samantha McCulloch said on Sunday morning the Andrews government should \u201crecognise the role of gas in a cleaner energy future\u201d.  We congratulate Premier Daniel Andrews and his government on again securing the endorsement of the people of Victoria. Victoria is facing significant energy challenges during this term: its population is a large user of gas but the state is not producing needed new supply and regulators forecast production to decline 43% by 2025 \u2013 only three years away. The state is outsourcing its energy security to Queensland and South Australia. This is putting pressure on the east coast energy market and costing Victoria\u2019s 2 million domestic and 65,000 business users at least an extra $2 a gigajoule whenever they need to transport gas from Queensland.  McCulloch said \u201cthe best way to put downward pressure on prices is to bring on new gas supply that is close to where it is found\u201d but blamed fracking bans and \u201cregulatory uncertainty\u201d for a lack of development within the state. The International Energy Agency has previously said limiting global heating to 1.5C as set out in the Paris agreement meant there can be no new oil, gas or coal investment beyond the end of 2021. This morning Andrews said he wanted gas reservation policy to help control prices but constitutional arrangements meant the Victorian state government could not go it alone and must wait for action by the federal government.  Updated at 6.38am GMT    12.11am   Matthew Guy to step down as leader of Victorian Liberal party  Victorian opposition leader Matthew Guy has announced he will step down after last night\u2019s crushing defeat. He just released a statement:  Once again, I congratulate the Australian Labor party on winning the 2022 Victorian state election. I want to put on record my deep appreciation to all the Liberal and National party candidates, their campaign teams and volunteers for the tireless work they have done, particularly over recent weeks. The respectable statewide two-party-preferred swing to the Coalition of 3-4% was most profound in the exceptional swings to the Liberal party in Melbourne\u2019s north and west. This represents a huge future electoral opportunity for the Liberal party. As soon as it is clearer which Liberal party candidates will form the next parliamentary party room, I will call them together to elect their new leadership team. I will not be a candidate for the position of leader.   Updated at 1.46am GMT    11.51pm    It\u2019s all happening.       11.50pm    The Greens to back IR bill after amendments Greens leader Adam Bandt said his party will support the governments proposed industrial relations bill after key amendments were secured, including giving parents the right to request unpaid parental leave and no changes to the better-off-overall test. In a statement released this morning Bandt said the amendments would ensure no one was left behind and hailed the bill as \u201can important win for all workers\u201d:  The Greens strongly back most of what is in his bill, including abolishing the ABCC and multi-employer bargaining, but we wanted to ensure low paid workers wouldn\u2019t go backwards because of some of the changes. This is an important win for all workers, especially low-paid workers in the retail and the hospitality industries. The better off overall test has been preserved. Workers will now have an enforceable right to unpaid parental leave and better work-life balance.  Greens senator Barbara Pocock said the changes would ensure pay and conditions for those in the care sector:  It\u2019s time workplace law caught up with the real lives of Australia\u2019s 5 million working carers \u2013 women and men. Our workplace relations system is broken, but we can fix it, and this bill is a good start. Australian workers, especially women, have waited decades for an enforceable right to flexibility that actually works for them. The Greens have secured important changes on flexibility and on unpaid parental leave. These will now be enforceable rights. There is more to do and we will move further amendments in the Senate and continue to fight for greater flexibility and workplace laws that support working carers in the coming months.   Updated at 6.39am GMT    11.42pm    Government\u2019s IR commitents Here is the list of commitments the government has made to secure David Pocock\u2019s support on its IR bill:  A commitment from the prime minister to establish a new independent economic inclusion advisory committee led by the treasurer and social services minister to review the adequacy of support payments annually ahead of each federal budget, and publish any recommendations. A commitment from the prime minister to consider and respond to the recommendations of the Murray review within this term of government to better protect subcontractors. A commitment from the employment and workplace relations minister to review modern awards. Small businesses with fewer than 20 employees based on headcount (and excluding seasonal workers and other irregular casuals) will be excluded from the single-interest multi-enterprise bargaining stream. The government will undertake a statutory review no later than two years after the passage of the bill The \u201cgrace period\u201d during which a single-interest multi-enterprise bargaining authorisation can be granted from six to nine months. Introduce a new reasonable comparability threshold into the common interest test. Introduce new safeguards for businesses that have fewer than 50 employees based on headcount wanting to exit multi-enterprise bargaining and with the onus of proving a common interest on the applicant for these businesses. Increase the \u201cminimum bargaining period\u201d for the purpose of intractable bargaining declaration from six to nine months. Require conciliation to take place before arbitration over working arrangements unless there are exceptional circumstances. Remove the right to veto an agreement by allowing the Fair Work Commission to compel a multi-enterprise agreement to be put to a vote regardless of whether employee organisations agree and prevent parties unreasonably withholding agreement. Carve out civil construction from all streams of multi-enterprise bargaining. Give the minister a new power to declare an industry or occupation eligible for the supported (previously low paid) bargaining stream. Make it much easier for firefighters, including volunteer firefighters, to access workers compensation benefits for seven additional cancers, including women\u2019s reproductive cancers. Task the new national construction industry forum with providing advice to government on measures that will ensure contractors are paid accurately and in a timely manner in the construction industry.   Updated at 6.40am GMT    11.41pm    Pocock says he \u2018struck a wide-ranging\u2019 IR agreement Senator David Pocock has released a statement following the announcement this morning that the federal government\u2019s new IR bill will pass the Senate with his support. Pocock says he has \u201cstruck a wide-ranging agreement with the Albanese government\u201d to amend the legislation in a way that \u201cdoesn\u2019t put small business at risk or leave the most vulnerable behind\u201d. His agreement also \u201cincludes a commitment from the government to establish, in legislation, an expert advisory committee, led by the treasurer and minister for social services, to review the adequacy of support payments annually ahead of each federal budget, and publish their recommendations\u201d. Pocock:  This is now a substantially different bill to the one introduced in the House of Representatives a month ago. It is better for business, better for workers and makes sure the most vulnerable in our community are no longer left behind. I have worked with the government to push them as far as they would go, and then a step further to ensure they addressed key concerns raised with me. This legislation introduces significant reforms to Australia\u2019s industrial relations system that will benefit women and low-paid workers in particular. There are now additional safeguards in place for business, especially small businesses, and some important new powers to better protect the low-paid and those reliant on government support. In what I believe will be a game changer for people living below the poverty line in our country, the government will now also receive independent expert advice that is made publicly available before each federal budget looking at how the most vulnerable in our community are faring and what needs to change to ensure we don\u2019t leave them behind. Given the pace at which this legislation has moved, my concern has been to ensure stakeholders are heard and any issues addressed. Along with my team we have worked incredibly hard to hear from those who will be affected by it and balance the concerns to help secure a better bill. I went into this seeking to get the best policy outcome, balancing the urgent need for workers to get a pay rise, with legislation that will work in practice by delivering pay rises for those that need it while not placing unreasonable burdens on small businesses. I believe we have achieved the right balance, significantly improving the legislation with the added commitment that will help stop governments leaving our most vulnerable behind. I acknowledge the tough but fair negotiations with the government that have got us to this point. I thank the prime minister and Minister Burke for their constructive engagement and the many, many workers and businesses, along with their representatives, who have come to me over the past month. I also pay tribute to the efforts and advocacy of members in the lower house as well as community advocates who have championed many of these reforms for years.   Updated at 11.48pm GMT    11.31pm    \u2018Our politics may be divided but our community is united\u2019 Daniel Andrews on when he saw the numbers:  I was probably on the phone. I was probably on the phone but there were lots of hugs and obviously, went and gave the speech and then went home with family and friends senior staff and had a couple of glasses wine.  On whether the election process could require reform given the number of early votes and funding issues:  I think 25 people handing out for one candidate essentially harassing people, getting \u2013 25 people \u2013 getting up in their face, being deliberately as ugly as possible \u2013 that\u2019s perhaps not consistent with our mainstream values as cross our state. Conduct matters. The amount of feedback I had from people who were intimidated and fearful and all of that, that\u2019s not us. That is not us. I just say again, our politics may be divided, but our community is united.   Updated at 6.40am GMT    11.27pm   Andrews condemns \u2018nasty stuff\u2019 on election campaign trail  Daniel Andrews thanks Labor volunteers and staff for their endurance over the course of the campaign despite \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201cnasty stuff\u201d:  We\u2019ve seen some pretty nasty stuff. On behalf of my booth workers and volunteers and my staff and friends and family who handed out for me yesterday, there\u2019s no place for that. We can disagree. Violence and some of the commentary, the partisanship in the worst sense, that doesn\u2019t do anyone credit. I want to thank my team across the state but particularly in my community for keeping their cool, not taking the bait, not engaging in it.  He also stresses a positive message:  On a broader level, across the state these last few years, I have never been more certain that hope always defeats hate. You have to work hard, get things done. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.   Updated at 6.41am GMT    11.22pm    Dan Andrews is asked about his first 100 days of government and says it will look like \u201ca lot of hard work\u201d:  I\u2019m not here to talk about what the first bill will be. The parliament will sit this year as soon as the writ is returned. We will get rid of the formalities to make a fast tart.  There\u2019s a considerable amount of sloganeering going on here and not a lot of detail.  Updated at 6.41am GMT    11.20pm    \u2018You\u2019ve got to do what matters\u2019 not what\u2019s popular, premier says Dan Andrews says he had \u201cvery little\u201d sleep last night and that Victoria is playing a significant role in Australian politics as a progressive state:  We are the centre of critical thinking, the centre of all the big ideas in our nation and we are best when we\u2019re out in front, leading our nation and in so many different agendas: mental health, family violence, early childhood , renewable energy, climate change action \u2013 not climate change talk, climate change action \u2013 and many other areas. We are well out in front and it does every Victorian great credit that we have voted as a community to keep that big agenda going, those big ideas, because big ideas make a big difference in everyone\u2019s life.  Andrews is also casting the election result as a repudiation of the politics that attacked the government over its handling of the pandemic \u2013 particularly the anti-vaccination protesters who have been a loud presence within Victorian state politics over the last two years:  I\u2019m not going to do what is popular. Doing what is right will be from time to time very unpopular, but when you swear that oath, you get in the job, you don\u2019t have the luxury of pandering. You\u2019ve got to do what matters, what\u2019s right. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. For me, that\u2019s the ultimate expression of a brand of politics that isn\u2019t about me and my team but the people we serve, because trying to be popular all the time doesn\u2019t work because you have to do what\u2019s right. That is what we will always strive to do.   Updated at 6.41am GMT    11.12pm    Andrews promises to govern for \u2018all Victorians\u2019 Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking to reporters now, where he is promising to deliver on free kindergarten, more nurses and ambulances, more schools and and a state power company that will bring \u201crenewable energy for all Victorians rather than greedy profits\u201d. He begins the presser with a pitch to those who didn\u2019t vote for him.  I do however have a really important message for those who couldn\u2019t see their way clear to vote [for] us last night. We will govern for you as well. We will make sure that your kids get free kindergarten, we will make sure that you get lower power bills because of more energy, not less. We will make sure that you will get the skills you need for the job you want. We will make sure that we govern for all Victorians no matter where you live, what you do for a living or how you voted. That\u2019s the most important thing. We have always done that and we we recommend today to doing that important work.  We\u2019re now moving to questions.  Updated at 5.26am GMT    11.05pm    Victorian state election outcome a \u2018powerful result\u2019: RishworthThe federal childcare minister, Amanda Rishworth, also commented on the result. Rishworth told Sky News:  It was a very powerful result ... and suggests is, I think, a stamp of approval on [Daniel Andrews\u2019] positive plans going forward ... The federal government\u2019s been working with the states. There has been a real change in the way that the new Labor government federally has been working positively with the states and territories. And one of Dan Andrews\u2019 messages is that positive plans, when you put them forward, explain them to the people, then you will get a sense of endorsement from them. So certainly, I think the implications federally is that there is a good partnership between the federal government and the Dan Andrews Labor government. And I think we will all look forward to continue to work to deliver for Victorians. But also right across the country.  Is there a message from an increase in non-major party primary vote though? Rishworth said:  Look, there\u2019s no doubt that there has been ... when other options are put on the table, there are people, there are voters looking at other options and we\u2019ve seen an increased [minor-party vote] but we do have a majority government in Victoria. There\u2019s a clear majority government in Victoria and that bodes well, I think for decision making going forward.   Updated at 5.16am GMT    11.00pm    Money talks in Victoria as federal Coalition looks for lessons in election lossOne of the fun games on the day after a state election is to look for federal implications (and vice versa). The shadow immigration minister Dan Tehan is a senior Victorian Liberal and has drawn out one interesting takeaway for the federal Coalition. Tehan told Sky News:  Well, well, first of all, in terms of the federal implications, there\u2019s only one that I can can see and that\u2019s to do with campaign finance. Now, one of the things that Dan Andrews has successfully done in the Labor party here in Victoria through the campaign finance reform is made sure that the incumbent, the Labor party, has an advantage. Now, the Labor party federally is looking at campaign finance reform.  Now, the Liberal party and the National party needs to look at this legislation very carefully because in Victoria, it has meant that it has cemented an advantage to those in power. We cannot stand by and let the same thing happen again because otherwise we will be giving Labor a financial advantage over us when it comes to a national campaign. So we need to learn that lesson.  Guardian Australia revealed in July that in addition to election pledges to have real-time disclosure of donations and a $1,000 disclosure threshold that federal Labor wants to legislate caps on spending. There\u2019s no bill before parliament yet \u2013 the joint standing committee on electoral matters is considering the issue as part of its 2022 election review first. But it\u2019s one to watch, especially because similar arguments about not entrenching incumbents have been made by Climate 200.  Updated at 5.16am GMT    10.52pm    Things are moving quickly this morning.   Updated at 5.26am GMT    10.50pm    Major parties claw back \u2018Greenslide\u2019 as count continues  For those waking up wondering what happened to the Greenslide and teal gains in the Victorian election, the major parties have had a bit of a comeback with the benefit of favourable prepoll votes. While the Greens are on track to win Richmond, their second potential pickup (Northcote) is in doubt. Labor\u2019s Kat Theophanous now holds an 865-vote lead against Green Campbell Gome. Albert Park is now being counted as a Labor-Liberal contest, with Labor easily winning. The seat is still in contention but the Greens will need to boost their primary (20.5%) and benefit from preference flows to overtake the Liberals (29.3%) and leapfrog into second place. In Hawthorn the early teal lead has been gobbled up by Liberal John Pesutto, who now has a narrow 383-vote lead against Melissa Lowe. In Mornington, former federal MP Chris Crewther has a super-slim 177-vote lead against independent Kate Lardner. Remember in the 2020 US presidential election in which Donald Trump benefited from a \u201cred wave\u201d of election day votes before Joe Biden took the lead courtesy of a \u201cblue shift\u201d? A similar dynamic is at play here, with mostly younger voters favouring the teals and Greens in election day votes, and the major parties having a comeback courtesy of mostly older prepoll voters.  Updated at 5.21am GMT    10.48pm    Parliament will sit into next Saturday to pass bill Tony Burke says he understands parliament will sit into next Saturday to pass the bill in the Senate before the end of the parliamentary year:  What will happen is on Thursday afternoon, we will suspend, rather than adjourn the House and then on Saturday morning at nine we will come back. No matter what happens and no matter how quickly the secure jobs better pay bill gets through, there will still be legislation going through the Senate and still amendments to be considered by the House \u2013 we will still be here on Saturday to deal with that.  On the fallout from the Bell report and the conduct of Scott Morrison signing himself into multiple ministries, Burke says the behaviour of the former prime minister undermined the principles of responsible government:  The parliament is where you have responsible government. If you are not allowed to know who the ministers are when you are directing questions, the whole concept collapses, and what happened with what Scott Morrison did wasn\u2019t simply a decision of him on this particular matter.  Burke would not be drawn on where he stood on a motion to censure Morrison as he did not want to \u201cget ahead of the cabinet deliberations\u201d.  Updated at 5.26am GMT    10.43pm    Small business and multi-employer bargaining Tony Burke says the head count in business won\u2019t be able to be \u201cgamed\u201d with a \u201csudden upping or downing of casuals who are just on the books and aren\u2019t getting shifts\u201d. Businesses with up to 50 staff will be able to argue that it is not reasonable to include them in a deal struck under multi-employer bargaining. Burke explains how this will work in more detail:  There is a new test within the common interest test that is being added. It is being added for everybody. As to whether the businesses are reasonably comparable, so that\u2019s the new test that is there. So, for example, if a business says, \u2018Look, we have nothing to do, not enough to do with these other businesses that are in the multi-employer stream,\u2019 asks if you are fewer than 50, it is effectively the case has to be made that you should be included, and that makes it much easier for small businesses. Not like there is an onus on them to make that case.  The onus then would be on a union to prove that a workplace should be included, rather than it being automatically assumed a small business with under 50 employees should be included. On the operation of how this will work more broadly:  What happens is employers either opt in or their workforce votes to opt in, and then before the Fair Work Commission, they have to work out whether there is a common interest, whether it\u2019s reasonably comparable and also whether or not it is in the public interest, and where you go sector-wide for sectors that are critical to the national economy, at that point, it is pretty hard to see things passing the public interest test.   Updated at 5.25am GMT    10.38pm    Burke working through IR bill\u2019s \u2018structural issues\u2019 Tony Burke is working through each of the \u201cstructural issues\u201d that will be dealt with as part of the bill.The minister says the government will be adopting all the recommendations of the Senate inquiry, including the shift to the small business head count going to 20, to be \u201cexcluded from the interest stream\u201d. Provisions have been included for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees to make it easier for them to argue at the Fair Work Commission that they don\u2019t believe an agreement made under the new multi-employer bargaining system is not reasonable:  In terms of workers, to make sure that we don\u2019t run into the same problem that happened with the previous low-paid stream where you had a section of a bill of an act that looked fantastic but nobody could get into it, a capacity to make sure that specific occupations can be deemed to be part of that supported stream for low-paid workers. And finally, there will be outside of my portfolio \u2013 so I can just give you the high points of it \u2013 there will be a new statutory advisory committee made up of experts that, in the lead-up to every budget, will provide independent advice as to the structural challenges on economic inclusion, as well as going all the way through to looking at the different rules and the levels of payments to provide independent advice to the government, as those budgets are put together.   Updated at 5.24am GMT    10.34pm   IR bill set to pass with support from David Pocock  Federal minister Tony Burke says the industrial relations bill will pass with support from David Pocock. Burke said he is in Canberra where he has been meeting with the senator is \u201cconfident\u201d the bill will pass:  It hasn\u2019t been an easy negotiation and Senator Pocock has been very clear on a series of principles that he wanted to look at. As you know, he would have preferred that everything was dealt with next year when we said we wanted to make decisions this year. It has involved a very intense process, a lot of meeting, a lot of detail. There are effectively three sorts of issues that have come to the fore. One is with respect to small business, the other is low-paid workers, and finally a concern that he has that is outside of my portfolio, but is part of the agreement, that goes to structural issues that we can put in place to deal with people [receiving welfare payments].   Updated at 5.23am GMT    10.30pm    Morrison treated his supporters \u2018with contempt\u2019, Niki Savva says Interesting conversation by the Insiders panel this morning, with Niki Savva saying the mood within the Coalition has turned sharply against Scott Morrison. She says there is a belief inside the party that they were loyal to Morrison, but he took it for granted:  They are furious with him and I think the general view is that he showed contempt for them, for the people who were closest to him, who followed him religiously in many ways, and were loyal to the fold, and he treated them with contempt. He treated cabinet with contempt and he treated parliament and parliamentary processes with contempt, for whatever reason. None of the reasons that he has given stack up, except, it sounds like he was deluded \u2026 And so the view amongst them now is that he should just pack his bags and go.  Morrison has maintained he acted in the national interest in secretly appointing himself to a range of ministries while he was prime minister.  Updated at 5.22am GMT    10.25pm    \u2018We are in danger of a reverse Coalition,\u2019 Katharine Murphy says Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor Katharine Murphy is on the ABC Insiders panel and says the Victorian election result is a \u201cmassive realignment\u201d of the Australian electorate that is \u201cshifting away from major parties\u201d:  Serious point \u2013 the Labor party thus far is winning the realignment war. They did federally. They did at the state level. Both of those results could have resulted in minority governments. It didn\u2019t in either contest.  She also said the result showed that with a good climate policy, the Liberal and National parties can hold off challengers from independent teals in their seats \u2013 which is a lesson for the federal Coalition \u201cif Peter Dutton is listening\u201d:  We see Peter Dutton doing some weird Tony Abbott reboot, despite seeing a federal result and now a state result that suggests that that is quite dangerous as a political strategy. I think the Liberal party is in danger at this point of becoming a regional party. We are in danger of a reverse Coalition, where the National party is the dominant player in the Coalition.   Updated at 5.19am GMT    10.19pm    \u2018I\u2019m thrilled to do it for another four years\u2019 Asked about the \u201cugly\u201d nature of this campaign, Daniel Andrews casts the result as a direct rejection of the anti-vax politics that have dominated headlines the last two years. He says he plans to serve the full four-year term and has no plans to retire early:  It is the greatest honour of my life. I\u2019m here to get things done. I\u2019m thrilled to do it for another four years.  And that\u2019s it.  Updated at 5.19am GMT    10.16pm    \u2018We need a gas reserve,\u2019 premier says Daniel Andrews is asked about the 6% swing Labor has suffered against it, and the 9% swings in Melbourne\u2019s north-west suburbs. He doesn\u2019t directly address the question, but points to the austerity politics of the Victorian Liberals, which \u201cwere going to cancel projects\u201d.  What happens when you cancel projects \u2013 you cancel jobs.  He is asked about what the strong result for the Greens means for the state\u2019s approach to climate change and energy \u2013 and specifically whether the result will force him to shift his view on a gas deal:  When it comes to energy, the cheapest form of energy is renewable energy. That is a fact. On gas, I\u2019m very encouraged. My discussions with prime minister Albanese have been very positive. We need a gas reserve. Our gas for our businesses and our households. That\u2019s what\u2019s really, really important.  Andrews says he would like to see a gas reservation policy and would introduce one at state level but cannot do so as it would not be constitutional:  These companies are making Australians pay terrible European prices. Yes, there is a terrible war going on in Europe. We are a long way from Europe. What we don\u2019t need, sell it, by all mean.  Andrews also takes a swipe at the former federal Coalition government on climate change:  We\u2019ve had nine wasted years and things are so much more challenging today because we\u2019ve had a revolving door of energy ministers and no coherent energy policy. Albo is turning that around and that\u2019s good for households, good for jobs and really good for the planet, too.   Updated at 5.18am GMT    10.10pm    \u2018So proud to lead the best state in the nation\u2019 Daniel Andrews is asked about the moment after his win \u2013 the raised fist \u2013 and about whether the victory was vindication after two hard years:  My politics has never been about the win, it is always about the work. You\u2019ve got to win to do that, but I grew up being taught every day that with opportunity comes a profound obligation to do your best, to work hard, to do what matters, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve delivered over these last eight years.  Andrews says the outcome was a sign of Victorians rejecting the divisive politics of the last few years:  We got vaccinated. We looked out for each other. That kindness and compassion, it makes you so proud to lead the best state in the nation and a state that has faith in science, a state that is prepared to make big sacrifices to save tens of thousands of lives.   Updated at 5.17am GMT    10.07pm    Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking to David Speers on ABC Insiders this morning after his historic election win.  Updated at 5.16am GMT    9.59pm    Victorian Greens stake their claim with election \u2018Greenslide\u2019 The Victorians Greens are claiming a \u201cGreenslide\u201d result after recording an increased primary vote and probably gaining two seats, with more to come as counting continues. Teal independents were also leading in two tight contests last night, with Melissa Lowe slightly ahead of former Liberal shadow attorney general John Pesutto in Hawthorn. In Mornington, Kate Lardner \u2013 who isolated from her supporters after testing positive to Covid \u2013 was also slightly ahead of former federal Liberal MP Chris Crewther. The Greens retained inner-city seats of Melbourne, Prahran and Brunswick on Saturday, while picking up hotly contested Richmond, where Gabrielle De Vietri beat Labor\u2019s Lauren O\u2019Dwyer. The party was also on track to win Northcote. But the Greens were also outperforming expectations in other seats, including Albert Park, Footscray, Pascoe Vale and Preston, with all of them too close to call by 11pm. Addressing supporters after the party claimed Richmond, Greens leader Samantha Ratnam declared:  Tonight, my friends, I\u2019m so proud to be up here to tell you all that the Greenslide continues tonight. We\u2019re on track to colour in the map of inner-city Melbourne green. Melbourne is green, Prahran is green, Brunswick is green and now Richmond is green. Our statewide vote means we have also won [the upper house seat of] Southern Metro back. And I am pleased to say that it looks very good in Northcote, and I\u2019m hoping to be back with an update soon, and there are a number of other seats in play.

Updated at 4.16am GMT    9.46pm    Victorian Liberal party shellshocked after heavy election loss Victorian opposition leader Matthew Guy has conceded the Coalition has \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d after the party lost its third successive election to Labor\u2019s Daniel Andrews. While Labor\u2019s primary vote fell by about 5.6% statewide, the Coalition failed to capitalise on it, with the Liberal party in particular going backwards and recording a primary vote below 30%. It was not yet certain last night whether the Coalition would be able to improve on its 2018 tally of 27 seats in Victoria\u2019s 88-seat parliament. The election loss is sure to trigger more soul searching within the Liberal party, which also suffered humiliating defeats at the federal election in May. By the time the next term of government ends, the Coalition will have led Victoria for just four of the past 27 years. While Guy did not address his leadership when conceding defeat, it seems unlikely he will stay on after two successive defeats as leader. After calling Andrews to concede, Guy spoke for less than five minutes to a subdued crowd of supporters at the Doncaster bowling club in his electorate of Bulleen. He said it was important the state put the difficulties of recent years behind it and \u201ccome together\u201d:  The best of our state should be ahead of us, not behind us.  For more on this story read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Victorian state reporter Adeshola Ore.   Updated at 4.14am GMT    9.39pm   Good morning  And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. Daniel Andrews has become the first Victorian premier since fixed four-year terms were introduced to win three elections back-to-back in a historic win for the state\u2019s Labor party. Labor retained government despite a 6% swing against it, holding on to its majority in an election contest that was widely read as a verdict on Andrews\u2019 handling of the state\u2019s pandemic response. Other winners in the election were the Greens, who cemented their place within Victoria\u2019s political landscape, and the independents, who grew their share of the vote. The result is disastrous for the state\u2019s Liberal opposition, with questions now about the fate of the leader Matthew Guy, who led the party to its second significant defeat. The loss follows the federal election defeat this year, while the Coalition is in retreat across the country, with Labor governments dominant in Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.

Antonio Conte\u2019s post-match press conference will be interesting ....      10.31pm    The only Spurs players whose performances were close to acceptable in that game were Dier, Davies and Kulusevski. Kane was wretched, Son sloppy, and Winks and Hojbjerg irrelevant. As for Boro, they were all excellent. Jones and Howson were especially notable, and Coburn\u2019s goal will never be forgotten.    Updated at 10.56pm GMT    10.27pm   Full-time: Boro 1-0 Spurs  Boro have done it again! After eliminating Manchester United in the previous round, they\u2019ve disposed of Spurs to reach the quarter-final! Their victory is fully deserved, they were the better team throughout and had chances to win it in normal time before 19-year-old Josh Coburn scored a glorious winner in extra-time! Spurs were awful, Conte will start keening again, no doubt, but Boro can party.     10.25pm    ET 30+2 min: Outstanding defending by Boro ... and suddenly Crooks is leading a counter! Balogun takes it into the let-hand side of the box and shoots low for the far corner ... he scuffs it ... but Coburn stretches out a leg and tries to prod it home ... but he can\u2019t connect, mising by a whisker!      10.23pm    ET 30+1 min: Lumley gets down sharply to turn a deflected header by Dier out for another corner.     10.22pm    ET 30 min: Bamba does brilliantly to cut out a low cross by Dier at the near post. Otherwise Kane would have had a tap-in.     10.21pm    ET 29 min: Spurs are coming on strong but making no inroads into a Boro\u2019s massed defence.      10.20pm    ET 28 min: Bamba on, Howson off.   Updated at 10.20pm GMT    10.17pm    ET 25 min: Spurs substitution: Scarlett on, Davies off.  Updated at 10.21pm GMT    10.17pm    ET 24 min: Crooks loses the ball in midfield. But Son is too slow to take advantage, so Crooks scampers back and relieves him of the ball. A vignette that sums up the difference between the sides today.     10.15pm    ET 22 min: At times like these opposition crowd would normally sing \u201cyou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d at the visiting Premier League manager, for the lark. But if this score stays the same, perhaps Conte will invite the board to sack him in his post-match press conference?      10.12pm    ET 19 min: Lumley saves well from Son. Then he leaps to beat Kane to an incoming cross.      10.11pm   GOAL! Boro 1-0 Spurs (Coburn ET 17)  What a breakthrough! Crooks slipped in Josh Coburn after a throw-in on the right, and the teenager drove to the corner of the six-yard box and thundered the ball past Lloris! If Var were in operation, we\u2019d have to wait to see whether his armpit was offside, but it\u2019s not, so the Riverside erupts!       Updated at 10.32pm GMT    10.08pm    ET 16 min: Spurs have reverted to a back three. Evidently Conte was aghast at how often Boro cut them open when they went to a back four, even if Spurs also looked more attacking in that spell.     10.07pm    ET 16 min: Spurs substitution: Reguilon, Kulusevski off. Boro susbtitution: Peltier on, McNair off.     10.05pm   Half-time in extra-time: Boro 0-0 Spurs  Spurs started that period brighter than they had been all match, but they wound up hanging on as Boro tore through them. But in the dying seconds of the period, Kulusevski hared down the left and fizzed in a low cross that Son nearly flicked into the net.     10.02pm    ET 14 min: With Spurs in disarray again, Jones clips a pass to the back post. Tavernier meets it with a sidefooter from six yards. Lloris scrambles it away!      10.01pm    ET 13 min: Another powerful move by Boro, Jones again to the fore. It concludes with Howson booming one over from 20 yards.   Updated at 10.10pm GMT    10.00pm    ET 11 min: Serious pressure from Boro! Lloris plunges to the ground to cut out a dangerous low cross.     9.57pm    ET 10 min: \u201cWouldn\u2019t have said it a year ago but Davies and especially Dier are the ones who kept Spurs in it,\u201d write Yash Gupta. \u201cI don\u2019t have stats but amount of time Spurs have lost the ball in middle third is because midfield is shocking and I\u2019m not surprised as we can\u2019t hold the ball. Boro have been far superior.\u201d Spurs have improved in extra-time but Boro are still well in this.     9.56pm    ET 8 min: Slack pass by Winks is intercepted by Jones, who hares all the way forward and into the Spurs box. He tees up Tavernier, who dithers, losing the shooting chance. But he manages to feed the ball wide to Howson, whose low cross is cleared.     9.54pm    ET 6 min: Coburn and Bola on, Taylor and ... someone else off     9.53pm    ET 5 min: Son takes a corner short to Bergwijn, who has made a big difference since his introduction. He spoons in a dangerous cross. Lumley punches to safety     9.52pm    ET 4 min: Spurs have shifted into a higher gear; they\u2019re running the show now.      9.50pm    ET 2 min: Son miskicks when presented with the ball 12 yards out!     9.49pm    ET 1 min: Kulusevski signal improvement by Spurs as he swaps passes with Kane and rasps a low shot just wide from 20 yards.     9.47pm   End of 90 minutes: Boro 0-0 Spurs  Spurs are lucky to be still in the Cup after being lacklustre for most of the match so far. Crooks and Howson missed glaring chances to head Boro into the lead. Spurs need to improve to take this to penalties, at least.     9.44pm    90+3 min: Kulusevski motors down the right. He clips a cross beyond the far post, where Son arrives at speed and sends a downward header goalward from eight yards. Lumley saves Boro from a sickener!   Updated at 9.45pm GMT    9.41pm    90 min: There will be at least three more minutes.     9.40pm    90 min: Howson heads inches wide from the corner! Like Crooks earlier in the half, he was left all alone just yards from goal but couldn\u2019t find the target. Lucky Spurs!    Updated at 9.49pm GMT    9.39pm    90 min: What a move by Boro! They stream forward, Tavernier drives into the area and slips in Jones. He shoots low on the run, but Lloris gets down to claw it away!     9.37pm    88 min: Bergwijn plays an incisive pass through to Kane, who\u2019s too slow to get to it before Lumley. And it turns out he was offside anyway.     9.36pm    86 min: Both teams have switched to back fours as they seek a winner before extra-time.     9.35pm    85 min: Dier flings himself at a Son corner at the near post. He glances his header just over from an acute angle.   Updated at 10.24pm GMT    9.35pm    83 min: Spurs have replaced Doherty with Royal.      9.34pm    82 min: Bergwijn, who has just been introduced, injects the sort of urgency that Spurs have been missing all game. He cuts into the area and goes for goal ... but is foiled by a wonderful last-gasp tackle by McNair!      9.32pm    81 min: Howson roves forward and plays the ball wide on the right. IT\u2019s worked in to Sporar, who helps it on to Balogun. He\u2019s got room for a shot from 15 yards ... but guides it over the bar. That\u2019s the second god chance Boro have missed in this half, following Crooks\u2019 earlier blooper.     9.31pm    80 min: Doherty was Spurs\u2019 best attacker in the first half but has hardly got forward in the second.      9.29pm    77 min: Son loses the ball in midfield. Boro build forward again. Spurs retreat, which is what they\u2019ve done for most of the second half. Are they playing for penalties?     9.26pm    73 min: Boro substitution: Balogun on, Watmore off.     9.25pm    72 min: Boro have been the better team in the second half, sharper and more coherent. Spurs have been slow and sloppy.     9.24pm    70 min: Sessegnon makes gains down the left and digs out a cross. It floats over Kane, and there\u2019s no other Spurs player in the box.      9.22pm    68 min: Kane fails to control a pass from Sessegnon.     9.20pm    67 min: Spurs\u2019 midfield has been lamentable. Winks and Hojbjerg have let the game pass them by. Son, too. Only Kulusevksi has been consistently decent.      9.17pm    65 min: Howson curls the freekick around the ball but doesn\u2019t get enough bend on it to turn it back into the net. It sails a yard wide.      9.16pm    64 min: Boro have their danders up, led by the excellent Howson. Then Jones cuts in from the right and is tripped at the edge of the area by Winks. That\u2019s a freekick, four yards to the right of the D, one yard outside the box.     9.14pm    63 min:Howson\u2019s delivery mises out Crooks, and Sessesgnon heads clear.     9.13pm    62 min: Another Boro corner. Will Spurs pick up Crooks this time?     9.13pm    61 min: Kane loses possession again on mid-way. He\u2019s had a stinker today.      9.11pm    59 min: Kane scores from a flick-on at a corner and wheels away in delight. But then the home crowd celebrate because the ref rules it out for offside.      9.10pm    58 min: Dier hits a knuckle-ball free-kick from 25 yards. Lumley flings himself to his left to bat it out for a corner.      9.09pm    56 min: Kane, who has been sloppy today, gives the ball away in the Boro half. But Boro lose control of it and Davies pounces, only to be pulled back by McNair. That\u2019s a booking ... but Kane seems to think it should be a red, and his agitation prompts some argy-bargy. Ramires gets a booking for being too obstreperous.      9.06pm    55 min: Dier clears Sporar\u2019s low cross, giving Boro their first corner of the game. Howson curls it in ... and Crooks jumps to meet a free header from five yards! But he nods it over the bar! What a miss!    Updated at 9.19pm GMT    9.05pm    52 min:Powerful run by Watmore. He goes past three players and then gets the ball through to Jones, who goes down in the box in the vicinity of Sessegnon. The crowd howl for a penalty but the ref ignores their appeals, quite rightly.     9.01pm    49 min: Kane slips as he takes the freekick and squirts a lame shot into the wall, to the delight of a crowd that has appeared bored for much of this game.   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    9.01pm    48 min: Kulusevski is given a freekick after dashing towards the Boro box and going down under a challenge by Howson. Didn\u2019t look like a foul to me but it\u2019s a big chance for Spurs. Kane stands over the freekick just outside the D...     8.56pm    46 min: No personnel changes during the break. But let\u2019s hope the managers found a way to perk up their players, especially Conte because his team have been too passive.     8.43pm   Half-time: Boro 0-0 Spurs  Boro have held their own but neither side have been particularly threatening. Spurs are playing on the break but have lacked precision, Boro have been energetic and tidy but lacked penetration.     8.41pm    45 min: Strong finish to the half by Boro, especially from Howson and Jones, their two most dangerous-looking players so far. But still no sign of penetration.      8.39pm    44 min: Hojbjerg lopes down the right and cross for Sessegnon, whose header is blocked by Jones. Sesessegnon retries and works it back to Son, who plays it across to Doherty to shoot from the edge of the box. His low shot whizzes a couple of yards wide.     8.36pm    41 min: Kane is back defending at the edge of his own six-yard box, hoofing a wicked cross by McNair clear.  Updated at 8.37pm GMT    8.35pm    39 min: Her\u2019s one of the counter-attacks! Kane pokes the ball through for the under-lapping Doherty. Lumley charges out of his box to intercept but the Irishman gets to it first and nudges the ball past him and then takes a hurried shot from the corner of the box .... he\u2019s off-balance and lifts it over the bar!     Updated at 9.57pm GMT    8.33pm    38 min: Spurs have been playing on the counter-attack for the last 20 minutes or so. they\u2019re absorbing Boro\u2019s possession without much difficulty and looking for opportunities to strike fast on the break.     8.31pm    36 min: Kulusevski intercepts a nod-down by Fry. Then he stabs a nice pass through to Kane, who fails to get on the end of it.      8.29pm    34 min: A long ball over the top of the SPurs defence gives Jones something to run for. He does well to get to it but can\u2019t control the bounce, and Lloris dashes out to claim.     8.27pm    31 min: Intricate probing by Boro around the Spurs\u2019 box. Tavernier injects some dash and nearly breaks through, but doesn\u2019t.      8.24pm    29 min: After a strong spell of possession by Boro, and one promising burst by Jones, Spurs almost catch the hosts on the break. A long ball over the top found Son running clear, but he didn\u2019t get the ball under control quickly enough and was soon overwhelmed by backtracking defedners.     8.21pm    27 min: Watmore slips the ball through to Sporar, whose shot on the spin from 12 yards is blocked.      8.20pm    25 min: Tavernier makes a dart for the Spurs box. He beats on defender but then loses out to Dier. Spurs try to launch a counter, but KUluevski is caught in possession on half way.     8.19pm    23 min: Gleeful cheers as Sessegnon is punished for a foul throw, but Boro then make a mess of their own.     8.17pm    21 min: Sessegnon hasn\u2019t been shy about getting forward today. Dier tries to find him with a long pass from the back. Sessegnon does well to reach it and tries to direct it back to Kane near the penalty spot ... but he\u2019s offside.     8.16pm    19 min: Doherty intercepts a pass on halfway and offloads to Hojbjerg and then skittwrs down the right in anticipation of a through-ball. But Hojbjreg dawdles and has it nicked back off him.     8.13pm    16 min: Play has resumed. Boro string together a few passes in their own half but loses it as they try to move forward. Howson does exceptionally well to hare back and win the ball off Kulusevski.      8.09pm    13 min: Spurs are starting to dominate but Boro are well organised and determined. And now there\u2019s a break in play because Fry and Dijksteel clashed heads after outjumping Kane on half-way.   Updated at 9.55pm GMT    8.06pm    10 min: Spurs set up camp around the Boro box. Doherty clips an inviting pass across the face of goal. Sessegnon, charging in beyond the far post, narrowly fails to get on the end of it.     8.03pm    8 min: Sessegnon burst past Jone down the left and into the box. He tries to pick out Kane coming in at the far post, but Fry reads his intentions and make a precious interception.      8.00pm    5 min: Boro are holding their own. They even came close to threatening a moment ago when Tayler won the ball high up and fed Tavernier, who swung a dangerous cross in from the left. Dier was well placed to boot clear.     7.58pm    3 min: Sessegnon wins a corner down the left. Boro turn off and allow Son to take it quick and short to Winks, who fizzes the ball in towards the near post, hoping a teammate can get a touch to help it into the net. But a Boro defender gets to it first and clears.     7.57pm    1 min: And they\u2019re off. Tottenham try to establish control from the start by knocking the ball about but Boro are determined to not let them settle, chasing energetically.      7.55pm    Before kickoff there is a minute\u2019s applause to show support for Ukraine and its people. Everyone in the ground claps, and some hold aloft Ukrainian flags.      7.52pm    There\u2019s a booming, carnival atmosphere at the Riverside as the teams trot out on to the pitch. In case you\u2019re wondering, there is no VAR today.  Updated at 7.53pm GMT    7.49pm   Wilder's pre-match thoughts  \u201cI was never going to rest anybody, I\u2019m not so sure the boys would have appreciated being rested in the fifth round of the FA Cup in front of 34,000 punters,\u201d he says before hinting at the approach he wants to see from his team: \u201cIt\u2019s a contact sport and I hope everybody sees it that way.\u201d Aaron Connolly, by the way, failed a late fitness test.    Updated at 8.05pm GMT    7.39pm   Conte's pre-match pep talk  \u201cWe are in a good moment of form despite the defeat against Burnley,\u201d he tells the BBC. \u201cThe wins against City and in the last game against Leeds has to give us confidence, This is an important competition. We know today can be difficult but we are ready to play a god game. [The FA Cup} is a trophy and you know very well the importance of winning a trophy - and how difficult that is to do in England, where you have some of the best teams in the world.\u201d     7.10pm    Proof that Conte is taken this serious - and also that he wants to stimulate consistency - comes in the form of an unchanged starting lineup since last weekend\u2019s 4-0 victory at Leeds. Boro, meanwhile, make only one alteration to the side that lost 3-2 to Barnsley at the weekend, with Lea Siliki replaced by the goalscoring hero of the fourth round, Matt Crooks, who returns from suspension.  Boro: Lumley; Dijsteel, Fry, McNair; Jones, Crooks, Howson, Tavernier, Taylor; Watmore, Sporar Subs: Daniels, Olusanya, Peltier, Bamba, Siliki, Bola, Coburn, Balogun, Boyd-Munce Spurs: Lloris; Romero, Dier, Davies; Doherty, Hojbjerg, Winks, Sessegnon; Kulusevksi, Son; Kane Subs: Gollinni, Royal, Reguilon, Rodon, Sanchez, White, Bergwijn, Scarlett Referee: D England  Updated at 7.11pm GMT    6.50pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to a juicy FA Cup fifth-round tie. Don\u2019t think for a moment that these teams\u2019 minds will be elsewhere even though both are competing hard to rise a few extra places in their respective leagues. Spurs are seventh in the Premier League, grappling for a spot in the top four; and Middlesbrough are eighth in the Championship, battling to reach the playoff positions by the end of the season. But none of that will matter when they go head to head today in a Riverside Stadium that is sold out for the first time in five years. The home fans will be hoping to see a similar performance to the one that enabled Chris Wilder\u2019s team to oust Manchester United at Old Trafford in the last round. Spurs fans, meanwhile, will be hoping for one that doesn\u2019t send Antonio Conte into another paroxysm of despair. Let\u2019s get it on!  "

The club\u2019s foundation work with Save the Children to run the Coaching for Life programme in the world\u2019s largest refugee camp for Syrians fleeing war in their homeland. Suzanne Wrack has more:\n\n\n\n\n 4.56pm  \n\nOur writers take a look at all the weekend\u2019s top-flight fixtures here:\n\n\n\n\n 4.43pm  \nGovernment sees Candy and Boehly-Wyss as serious Chelsea buyers\n\nThe UK government views the British property tycoon Nick Candy and a consortium headed by Todd Boehly and Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss as serious contenders to buy Chelsea after inviting potential bidders to approach it with takeover proposals.\nChelsea are in an unprecedented state of limbo after sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich, with the Russian oligarch barred from selling the club for the time being, but the feeling in Westminster is that the government believes the process of finding a new owner will not be derailed by this week\u2019s dramatic developments.\nRead more below:\n\n\n\n\n 4.38pm  \n\nLeicester\u2019s Brendan Rodgers has given his take on the Chelsea turmoil. Rodgers, who spent four years at Chelsea from 2004-2008 as head academy coach and then reverse them coach, said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of friends at Chelsea, good people who have been there for a long time, so it\u2019s obviously a difficult situation they\u2019re having to manage.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you feel for Thomas [Tuchel] and the players because it\u2019s out of their control. You can only imagine. We\u2019re outside it and nothing to do with it and it\u2019s the first question you\u2019ve asked, so for Thomas, he\u2019s probably getting peppered by loads of questions when really his only focus is very much the football.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve total empathy for him and for the players, but they\u2019re very professional. They\u2019re an outstanding team and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll focus on that element between now and the end of the season.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 4.32pm  \n\nThe Brazil coach, Tite, has called up Gabriel Martinelli for the first time as he named his squad for their final two World Cup qualifiers, against Chile and Bolivia. Brazil have already qualified for the finals, and Tite has left out forwards Gabriel Jesus and Roberto Firmino, the latter having just recovered from a muscle problem. Neymar returns, and there is still room for 12 Premier League players in total.\nBrazil squad: Alisson (Liverpool), Ederson (Man City), Weverton (Palmeiras); Danilo (Juventus), Dani Alves (Barcelona), Alex Telles (Man Utd), Guilherme Arana (Atletico Mineiro), Thiago Silva (Chelsea), \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o (Real Madrid), Marquinhos (PSG), Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es (Arsenal); Casemiro (Real Madrid), Fabinho (Liverpool), Fred (Man Utd), Lucas Paquet\u00e1 (Lyon), Arthur (Juventus), Bruno Guimar\u00e3es (Newcastle), Philippe Coutinho (Aston Villa); Neymar (PSG), Richarlison (Everton), Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo (both Real Madrid), Gabriel Martinelli (Arsenal), Antony (Ajax), Raphinha (Leeds).\n\n\n\n 4.20pm  \n\nWhat do Chelsea\u2019s top-four rivals make of the situation? Watch to get the views of Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Manchester City\u2019s Pep Guardiola and Arsenal\u2019s Mikel Arteta.\n\n\n\n\n 4.12pm  \n\nThe Scottish Cup reaches the quarter-final stage this weekend \u2013 it\u2019s an all-Premiership affair, with both Old Firm sides heading to Dundee. Celtic face Dundee United on Monday night, while Rangers play Dundee on Sunday. \nGiovanni van Bronckhorst will assess John Lundstram and Joe Aribo, after both picked up injuries in the 3-0 Europa League win over Red Star Belgrade. For Mark McGhee\u2019s side, Lee Ashcroft and Charlie Adam are major doubts while Adam Legzdins and Cillian Sheridan are both unavailable.\nHearts host St Mirren on Saturday, and rivals Hibernian go to Motherwell on Sunday. Hibs have suffered a big injury blow, with the news that striker Kevin Nisbet could be out for nine months after undergoing knee surgery on Thursday.\n\n\n\n 3.56pm  \n\nMore from Richard Jolly on J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s press conference, where the Liverpool manager issued a textbook title-race rallying cry to his players.\n\u201cIf you want to look back later in life on very successful times, you should give absolutely everything now,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe have no time and no points to waste.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\nThe sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich have plunged Chelsea\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams into huge uncertainty \u2013 but both sides took to the field and won their games on Thursday night. Here\u2019s our report from Dagenham, where Emma Hayes\u2019 side kept their WSL title bid on track:\n\n\n\n\n 3.34pm  \n\nEverton have home games against Wolves (on Sunday) and Newcastle (on Thursday) \u2013 matches they surely need to get something from. He has Demarai Gray and Ben Godfrey available, and has brushed off reports of \u201ccrisis meetings\u201d after the 5-0 thumping at Tottenham.\n\u201cThis idea of a crisis meeting. It\u2019s just language and a lovely headline. It\u2019s not a crisis, it is very normal ... the idea is we find the answer and solution. To hear players speak a bit is important for me and some players spoke and that\u2019s good. But the ownership of it has to be mine as coach. \n\u201cI am fresh to the club so sometimes I find it a bit hard to take the constant negativity which kicks in instantly here when something goes wrong, because I don\u2019t feel that. This is football, it happens and we have to correct it. The only way to correct it is by training well, showing resilience and showing character. That\u2019s my message.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.30pm  \n\nThe Everton manager, Frank Lampard, has given his thoughts on the Chelsea situation but played down any personal relationship with Roman Abramovich.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough moment for [Chelsea],\u201d Lampard said. \u201cEverton is my priority and we\u2019ve got testing things in front of us but of course on a human level, people that are just doing their jobs and if their jobs are in danger, you care a lot about that.\u201d\nWhen asked about Abramovich, he said: \u201cI can probably count on one hand how many times I\u2019ve seen him in the last many years. I worked for Chelsea, which was an absolute pleasure for 13 years. And that\u2019s where I want to leave that one.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nTaking a brief diversion from the Premier League now, and France Football, organisers of the Ballon d\u2019Or, have announced changes to the way football\u2019s most coveted baubles are awarded. \nThe big change is that the awards will now be based on performances in a single season, rather than a calendar year. So the 2022 prizes will be based on the 2021-22 campaign, including the women\u2019s Euros this summer. Performances at the men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar will count towards the 2023 award.\nBeyond that, France Football are expanding the panel who draw up shortlists, and restricting votes to the world\u2019s top 100-ranked nations. There will also be less focus on a player\u2019s past achievements \u2013 all of which sounds like bad news for the Big Two.\n\n\n\n\n 2.53pm  \n\nLeeds play Norwich on Sunday, looking to move on quickly from Thursday night\u2019s one-sided home defeat to Aston Villa which saw sections of the home support chanting Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s name. The new manager, Jesse Marsch, admitted \u201cit won\u2019t be easy for me to sleep\u201d after the 3-0 defeat \u2013 but he has a plan to get his players back on track.\n\u201cWe just started trying a bunch of things that we never talked about and we have to stay to the plan,\u201d Marsch said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do that then we\u2019re weaker. We see the weaknesses of our players and not the strengths. So that will certainly be a message.\n\u201cI know with the fans you have to earn it. It\u2019s not given, right? It\u2019s the same with players, the same with directors ... but I\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019m here for the right reasons and I want to help this club be the things I really believe it can be.\u201d\nOne major positive for Marsch is that Patrick Bamford should be fit to make his first start since September, after coming on a substitute against Villa. For Norwich, Sam Byram, Christoph Zimmermann and Mathias Normann could all face late fitness tests.\n\n\n\n 2.36pm  \n\nThanks, John. I\u2019ll kick off with our match preview for Tottenham\u2019s trip to Old Trafford on Saturday evening:\n\n\n\n\n 2.32pm  \n\nAnd with that I will pass stewardship of today\u2019s blog to my estimable colleague Niall McVeigh.\n\n\n\n 2.24pm  \n\nMore from Friday\u2019s pressers: Roy Hodgson says he\u2019s enjoying the challenge of trying to keep Watford in the Premier League:. \u201cYes, I enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cI came back knowing what was in front of me, I came back feeling that I could do a job for the club and I still feel that. But whether or not I can produce what they really want, i.e: the change from being down the bottom and not winning to suddenly winning and shooting up the table \u2013 I can\u2019t guarantee that, I can only work towards it but I shall enjoy the work towards it, yes.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 2.56pm GMT\n\n\n 2.21pm  \n\nAnother line from J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s press conference earlier: the Liverpool manager was asked whether he had spoken to Thomas Tuchel about the Chelsea situation. This was his response:\n\n\u201cNo, Thomas and I know each other but we are not that close that we chat around the games, not in other moments. I feel for him and the players because it is nothing they are for, what happens around. There is one man that is responsible for that and that is Vladimir Putin, in the first place. I don\u2019t know about Roman Abramovich\u2019s role in all these things but over the years you could guess that maybe he is pretty close [to Putin] and then I think the British government is right, to be 100% honest, but it is still not cool for all the people at Chelsea and all the supporters, I get that, but I think the government is right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.13pm  \n\nRalf Rangnick was tight-lipped about Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s trip to Portugal which occurred last weekend when he was injured and was reportedly not sanctioned by the club. The Manchester United interim manager said: \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make sense to look back on what happened the last six or seven days, what is important is what happens tomorrow [against Tottenham]. Not to go through all this. He and Edison [Cavani] are both available for tomorrow. He resumed training yesterday, he trained the whole training session and I expect him to train today. I would\u2019ve thought he was available tomorrow.\u201d\nAsked if Ronaldo is content at United, Rangnick said: \u201cI haven\u2019t asked him if he\u2019s happy at Manchester at this club, he\u2019s fit again, resumed training yesterday and we shall see which formation we will line up with tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.02pm  \n\nThe only Saturday 3pm kick-off (!!) in the English top flight this weekend is a big one at the bottom. Brentford welcome Burnley to west London with the sides separated by just six points and the Clarets with two games in hand in their pocket. An away win would drag the Bees right back into the relegation dogfight \u2013 victory for Thomas Frank\u2019s side, on the other hand, would be a major step towards safety.\n\n\n\n\n 1.44pm  \n\nThomas Tuchel has said he would be happy to see Chelsea\u2019s shirts carry a message for peace. The mobile phone company Three suspended its shirt sponsorship on Thursday.\n\n\u201cYou can always wear a message for peace and it can never be the wrong message,\u201d said Tuchel, before adopting a more lighthearted tone. \u201cOf course maybe the worry is to find enough shirts that we can play with the sanctions! But as long as we have enough shirts and as long as the bus is full of fuel we will arrive and we will be competitive. This is what everybody can be sure of and what we demand of ourselves. When it\u2019s a big storm you dig in and you are all together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.28pm  \n\nPep Guardiola has also been up in front of the press today ahead of Manchester City\u2019s visit to Crystal Palace on Monday. He insists he\u2019s not thinking about a Treble this season and is instead focused solely on taking each game as it comes.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t motivate me, absolutely zero, lower than zero,\u201d he said of the prospect of three trophies. \u201cThese are fairytales. The reality is tough. Sport at a high level is so difficult.\u201d\u201cSelhurst Park is always a difficult place to go,\u201d the Spaniard said. \u201cIt is a final for us and we know it. Hopefully we can prepare well to arrive on Monday in good shape to face the opponent.\n\u201cAlways in my mind when we start to play the last 10 games of the Premier League every game is a final. When you have to play 55 games it is not a final but when you have 10 games left it is a final.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.19pm  \n\nIt feels very much in the background today, but there is a full set of fixtures in the Premier League this weekend. Two teams in entirely different veins of form meet at the Amex on Saturday:\n\n\n\n\n 1.01pm  \n\nWhat next for Marcus Rashford? Jamie Jackson takes a look at the Manchester United forward at a crossroads \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 12.52pm  \n\nSophie Downey was at the Chigwell Construction Stadium in Dagenham on Thursday night to talk to fans of Chelsea Women about a turbulent day for the club. Emma Hayes\u2019s side had little trouble on the pitch but uncertainty is rife off it.\n\n\n\n\n 12.43pm  \n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s deputy spokesman has been speaking to the lobby this morning and was asked about the Chelsea situation:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in constant contact with the club and the Premier League over any issues that have been raised through the sanctions and the licence that the Treasury has issued them. In terms of process, it\u2019s now up to the club to apply for any amended licence. I believe Chelsea have said that they will do that, and we\u2019ll obviously work with the club to consider any operationally necessary changes. But as we said yesterday, the measures we put in place are to ensure that any revenue generated can\u2019t find its way back to the Putin regime.\u201d\n\nThey were also asked about the Chelsea fans chanting the name of Roman Abramovich at Norwich on Thursday night:\n\n\u201cWe understand the strength of feeling that Chelsea fans will have, and their passion for the club. But it\u2019s important to remember that these sanctions are being imposed on those who have provided support to the Putin regime and the brutal assault on Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 12.38pm  \n\nEddie Howe has been speaking ahead of his Newcastle side\u2019s trip to Chelsea on Sunday. He doesn\u2019t expect matters off the field to impact the game on it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will have any bearing on Chelsea and how they play,\u201d he told PA Media on Friday. \u201cFor us, you can\u2019t change our preparation in any way. I\u2019ll be watching Chelsea historically and trying to build a game plan to try to go there and win, so I don\u2019t expect anything on the pitch, really, to be any different.\u201d\nAllan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton are both injury doubts for Newcastle.\n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nA nice lunchtime read from Steven Pye and the Guardian Sport Network:\n\n\n\n\n 12.11pm  \n\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll hand you over to John Ashdown to keep you company for the afternoon. Bye.\n\n\n\n 12.07pm  \n\nPatrick Vieira has been bigging up Michael Olise, and warning off potential suitors. \u201cNo, all I can tell you is Michael is a Palace player and we love him,\u201d Vieira said in his media conference when asked if Olise\u2019s contract included a release clause. \u201cHe is happy being with us and enjoying his football. Hopefully he will be with us for a long, long period of time.\u201d\n\u201cWhen he was at Reading and talking to the manager [Veljko Paunovic] at the time, he really believed that Michael had that quality to play in the Premier League. It was just about creating this kind of place where he could keep improving himself. We knew how good he was. He arrived and he was injured, so he had a difficult first couple of months \u2013 he couldn\u2019t train and he couldn\u2019t play. \n\u201cHe was really frustrated but he managed to get back on the field and his work ethic is unbelievable. He is a young player who wants to spend time on the field and wants to improve himself. He is in a really good place \u2013 playing well, enjoying his football, and it is good for the team.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.04pm  \n\nAntonio Conte has expressed his sympathy with Russian athletes who have been banned from competing at top level sports as a result of their government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, reports PA Media.\nWhile Conte has voiced his horror at the war and Russia\u2019s actions, the Spurs manager says the impact on sporting stars is \u201cvery sad\u201d given the dedication it takes to get to the highest level.\n\u201cI repeat, it\u2019s very sad that this serious situation, this war between Russia and Ukraine, is affecting football and the sporting [world],\u201d he said. \u201cTo know that Russia athletes are banned from competition is very sad. I think it\u2019s not fair. I know very well the work that they do every day for this competition.\n\u201cYou have to pay for this situation, I think it\u2019s not right. Honestly, I hoped the situation is going to be solved, because it\u2019s creating a lot of damage. We\u2019re in 2022 and to see this is horrible for everybody.\u201d\nConte was a former employee of Roman Abramovich and said: \u201cWe are talking about four or five years ago. At the time, Chelsea, also now, we\u2019re talking about a fantastic club. With an owner that made this club big. Don\u2019t forget that in the period he was the owner, Chelsea won everything. But it was for Chelsea. I think also we have seen other Russia owners in other teams. Not only in football but in many sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.48am  \n\nSuzanne Wrack has been talking to Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little and Leah Williamson about the Arsenal Foundation\u2019s work with Syrian refugees in Jordan.\n\nIf you offered me a chance to go and visit that camp at the weekend instead of playing my game it would be a moral dilemma. What\u2019s more important when you actually really start to think about it? Yet we are in a performance sport where if we don\u2019t win, or if we don\u2019t play well, then we don\u2019t have that impact. So it\u2019s a constant existential conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.35am  \nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp speaks\n\nA few nuggets from Klopp\u2019s presser: inevitably, he was asked about Roman Abramovich. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about the Abramovich role [with the Russian government] over the years but you can guess it\u2019s pretty close so the UK government is right in its approach. It\u2019s not good for Chelsea or their fans, I get that, but it\u2019s for the government to decide.\nOn Mo Salah\u2019s contract talks, the Liverpool manager is asked whether the signing of Luis Diaz might convince the Egypt forward to sign a new deal. \u201cI think Mo expects this club to be ambitious but it\u2019s not about that, it\u2019s a decision for Mo, it\u2019s all fine with Mo at the moment from my point of view, nothing further has happened, so we\u2019ll just have to wait for that \u2013 there\u2019s no rush.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.28am  \nPotential Chelsea buyers told they can approach UK government\n\nProspective Chelsea owners have been told to approach the UK government with potential takeover proposals, after the sanctioning of its current oligarch owner. The government effectively acting as a kind of administrator, then.\nHere\u2019s our story:\n\n\n\n\n 11.22am  \n\nMatip named Premier League player of the month: Ah yes, some football.\n\n\n\n\n 11.20am  \nTrivago maintains Chelsea links\n\nThree may have suspended its sponsorship of Chelsea yesterday but Trivago is sticking with them for now, saying it \u201cis important to us continue supporting the club\u201d.\n\u201cThe uncertainty over the current ownership situation of Chelsea FC has been challenging,\u201d Trivago said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, it is important to us to continue supporting the club, the fans and community along with the essential work that the Chelsea Foundation does to help those in need. We are looking forward to a transition of ownership as soon as possible and want to support the club in this process. We will provide any update to our business relationship if and when appropriate.\n\u201cAs a company of global citizens, we cannot condone the unprovoked and catastrophic invasion of Ukraine. We believe in a free world, freedom of speech and peace. We continue our efforts together with our teams to support the humanitarian efforts and to ease the suffering of the affected population. We stand with Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.11am  \n\nA more heartening one you may have missed from yesterday, the biggest girls\u2019 school football session in England, with around 90,000 taking part across 1,450 schools. Still work to be done though, with only 63% of schools offer girls\u2019 football in PE and only 40% offer extra-curricular football to girls.\n\n\n\n\n 10.55am  \n\nA spot of team news: Manchester City may have been dragged into a proper title race but the Premier League leaders remain in pretty formidable form, and this weekend they visit Crystal Palace, who are seeking an unlikely double over them. \nCity are hoping Nathan Ake and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo are fit after missing the Champions League nonevent against Sporting Lisbon through injury and illness respectively. Kyle Walker is also back in contention after being suspended for the Sporting game but Ruben Dias (thigh) is still out.\nFor Palace Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has impressed of late, could again start up front while Joel Ward (groin) and Nathan Ferguson (hamstring) are set to miss out once again. James McArthur is also still absent with a knock after just completing his return from a hamstring problem.\n\n\n\n 10.42am  \n\nArsenal launch Ukraine supporters club: this just in from their supporters\u2019 trust:\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.23am  \n\nWe\u2019ll talk about football eventually but some more financial basket case news first, from Derby, whose administrators say they are still working with potential buyers, a day after one group declared their interest was at an end.\nThe American businessman Adam Binnie, whose family have made two bids for the club, told the BBC on Thursday that administrators had rejected their most recent bid of \u00a330m and would not speak to them again unless they increased their offer.\nBut administrators Quantuma said on Friday that there is still interest in buying the club. \u201cThe joint administrators are continuing to work with prospective purchasers who remain interested in buying the club,\u201d the administrators\u2019 statement said.\u201cIt is our duty to secure an appropriate valuation for Derby County and to ensure we have a suitable bid to present to the EFL.\u201d\nThey added that they wished to assure supporters that \u201cdiscussions with interested parties are ongoing and focused on making the club financially sustainable for the long term\u201d. The EFL said on 3 March 3 it had received assurances from the administrators that sufficient funds were in place to see out the season. The Binnie family has no appetite to increase its offer.\n\n\n\n 10.18am  \n\nThe Fair Game campaign, set up in the wake of the European Super League fiasco, gains ever more relevance as the Chelsea mess unfolds. And its director, Niall Couper, has blamed their crisis on a football culture that ignores sustainability. \nCouper told PA Media: \u201cThe situation at Chelsea is yet another example of why football needs a radical rethink. The question marks over the club\u2019s future are a result of a culture that ignores financial sustainability. Too many clubs are being bankrolled. And the question has to be asked what happens when [those benefactors] disappear? We need to move away from a culture that is largely dependent on owner benefactors.\n\u201cIn 2020, 52% of clubs were technically insolvent and that was before the pandemic. Those numbers need to change. We need real-time financial reporting, powers to intervene when problems arise and crucially the Sustainability Index.\n\u201cAn index that uses the vast sums of funds from the TV revenues to reward well-run clubs, clubs that are financially sustainable and can survive without an owner benefactor.\u201d \n\n\n\n 10.05am  \n\nYet more Chelsea news: Sky reports that Nick Candy is still interested in buying Chelsea, the property developer having announced a \u00a32.5bn bid earlier in the week. He plans to attend Sunday\u2019s game against Newcastle.\n\n\n\n 10.01am  \n\nWest Ham\u2019s narrow defeat to Sevilla last night was a proper European occasion at a proper European stadium in a proper European city, but they may have to make do without Jarrod Bowen again in the second leg. The forward suffered a heel injury at Liverpool last weekend and it still hasn\u2019t cleared up, to the bafflement of David Moyes, his manager.\nBowen has undergone scans but the club are still in the dark about the extent of the problem. \u201cI have no idea at the moment,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to clear up exactly the injury. In all the scans and information we have it does not look too bad, but his action coming off the pitch at Anfield made it look more serious than we thought. And that has not added up.\n\u201cSince then Jarrod is slightly improving but not as fast as we hoped. We did not think it was anything serious. So we are still trying to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.53am  \nGovernment minister urges Chelsea fans to stop singing Abramovich\u2019s name\n\nGovernment minister Chris Philp has urged Chelsea fans to stop singing Roman Abramovich\u2019s name (thereby probably prompting them to do it even more loudly). PA Media has the story:\n\nChelsea fans have been asked to refrain from chanting in support of their owner Roman Abramovich by a Government minister. Supporters of the west London club sang Abramovich\u2019s name during the Premier League win at Norwich on Thursday night, hours after the Government had imposed sanctions on him due to his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\u2026 The technology minister Chris Philp urged Blues fans to remember why Abramovich had been sanctioned in the first place. \n\u201cI\u2019m a football fan myself, I\u2019m a Palace fan, in south London. So I understand why fans are very attached to their football clubs,\u201d he told BBC Radio Four\u2019s Today Programme on Friday morning.\n\u201cBut Roman Abramovich is someone who has been sanctioned now, yesterday morning, for his very close links to Vladimir Putin and the Putin regime.\n\u201cAnd I just say respectfully to the Chelsea fans, I know he\u2019s done a lot for the club, but the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and what the Russian regime are doing to civilians \u2013 shelling maternity hospitals and shooting civilians who are fleeing down humanitarian corridors \u2013 and that is more important than football.\n\u201cAnd I say that as a football fan myself, and I would just ask them to keep that in mind.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 12.44pm GMT\n\n\n 9.49am  \nPreamble\n\nMorning everyone, and welcome to a weekend destined to disappoint the \u201ckeep politics out of sport\u201d brigade, if anyone still buys that argument, with the fallout from the Roman Abramovich asset-freeze dominating the football talk of the moment. Reports and speculation continue to swirl around Stamford Bridge, including of impending staff redundancies, with the club unable to sell tickets and merchandise or operate in the transfer market. \nOn the pitch of course, Chelsea shrugged it all off with comfortable wins last night for their men at Norwich and their women at West Ham and Thomas Tuchel tried to put a brave face on it all by insisting it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. You can read all about the reaction here, Sean Ingle on what it all means here, and there\u2019s a must-read from David Conn here on how the game turned a blind eye for years on the source of Abramovich\u2019s wealth and power. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, Chelsea\u2019s opponents this weekend are Newcastle, who in a more ethically and properly regulated game wouldn\u2019t have the owners they currently do either. Ah, the beautiful game. \nOn the field, there are only three Premier League matches on Saturday, with a relegation battle between Brentford and Burnley and a top-four tussle between Manchester United and Tottenham the picks. And we\u2019ll have press conferences from Liverpool, Everton, Manchester United and Arsenal during the course of the day.\nSo buckle up and get in the mood with ten things to look out for this weekend:\n\n\n"

                    "body": "  4.53pm    That\u2019s your lot for today. Here is Will\u2019s report again for good measure:  Over in the WSL, it\u2019s Liverpool v Chelsea, and Sarah Rendell has all the latest right here:  Bye!  Updated at 4.55pm BST    4.52pm    Below are some links to the wealth of football content we\u2019ve published today:         4.45pm    On Sky Sports Moyes is asked for his views on West Ham\u2019s display: \u201cNot very good. We got a bit better after they scored. The first half was a poor game all round, really. \u201cWe had a game on Thursday, you have to take that into consideration ... we\u2019ve brought in new players and we\u2019re trying to find out about them. \u201cIt was mainly the players I know about, they\u2019re the ones who let me down today, with some poor play overall. We\u2019ve been showing signs of getting \u2018back to it\u2019 but I didn\u2019t think we did today. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t put two or three passes together ... when we got anything in the final third it was nearly always the wrong decision. But I\u2019ve got to say in the last 20 minutes we had chances to, at worst, get an equaliser so I think if you really analyse the end of it, we\u2019ve probably missed a few big chances.\u201d  Updated at 4.51pm BST    4.42pm    Will Unwin\u2019s report!      4.38pm    Lampard has a chat with Sky Sports: \u201cWell it\u2019s important, and it has to be real. And the reality here [at Goodison Park] is we\u2019ve worked really hard this season and probably deserved a bit more in certain games. And our fans are amazing, they\u2019ve taken to the team, and I think they feel what we\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s not always easy, it\u2019s the Premier League, you are going to be tested in so many ways \u2026 we had to hold on, and to fight, and dig in. We showed a lot of different parts of our game today in different ways, and we\u2019ll get better, for sure \u2026 no, it\u2019s important to celebrate. When you play a team of the level of West Ham you\u2019re looking for that win. We\u2019re unbeaten in a while, but we weren\u2019t getting the win, but we fought for it. \u201cThis team has to be a reflection of the fans. I think we\u2019re not unique like that. But I think the passion of the fans and how they feel about the team means that they demand things, and they better see them \u2026 and we\u2019ve got players now who can deliver that, characters in the team with strength \u2026 We want to build from the back and through the spine of the team because that\u2019s where we struggled a bit last year. And we\u2019ve done that with personnel, and work, and trying to improve. And hopefully our football can get even better. There were some lovely passages of play, especially building into the goal, but different parts of the game. We\u2019ll get better with that stuff \u2026 But, yep, I think the fans will hopefully be happy. We all understand, no one\u2019s getting carried away, but at the moment there\u2019s a decent feeling around the place. We\u2019ve got a long way to go but that\u2019s why the feeling is so good at the end. \u201cWe brought Neal in for that reason [goals]. He\u2019s a Premier League goalscorer, proven \u2026 and in the Championship lots of goals \u2026 Neal shows you why he\u2019s a striker of that level \u2026 his first touch, how close he keeps it to himself, and how quickly he gets his shot away, is the reason that hits the back of the net and the keeper doesn\u2019t sniff it. That\u2019s what goalscorers do.\u201d  Updated at 7.06pm BST    4.29pm    Everton\u2019s Alex Iwobi has a chat with Sky Sports: \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing very well, the performances have been good, it\u2019s just about getting the results. It\u2019s a great way to go into the international break with this result.\u201d Iwobi is asked about the goal-creating pass and gives a nicely deadpan answer: \u201cI\u2019m glad you remember \u2026 \u201cAnything I can do to create chances for my teammates \u2026 and I trust my players to hit the back of the net, and he was able to do that. Maupay is there too: \u201cIt [the goal] means a lot. I\u2019m very happy. But the win is the main thing for us. As Alex said, we\u2019ve been playing well, and it was just a matter of time. So I\u2019m happy for the win, happy for my goal, and hopefully we can build on it. \u201cAlways the key is the first touch. If the first touch is good you can have an easier finish \u2026 Great pass from Alex, good first touch, and good goal. I\u2019m just happy for the team. It\u2019s been coming.\u201d     4.18pm    \u201cThis is what the Everton\u2019s season will be like,\u201d writes the long-suffering Mary Waltz. \u201cSweating out points like a like a depression-era farmer trying to make a profit. Struggle, Struggle.\u201d Good times!     4.18pm    The match got better after half-time, too, but it could scarcely have got worse. \u201cA lot of huff and puff\u201d was the way Martin Tyler described the first half. Rubbish, I call it.     4.14pm    West Ham, Forest and Leicester make up the bottom three.     4.12pm    That felt like a big day for Everton and Frank Lampard. It was a significant test. And they passed. Defensively Everton were good, and in the second half, their midfielders and attackers came to the party. Gray was bright throughout, in fairness, constantly causing problems from the hosts\u2019 left wing, and Iwobi came to life in central midfield after the break. A big win for Lampard \u2013 hats off to him. West Ham on the other hand were not great, and Declan Rice was quiet in midfield, in fact almost anonymous. Plus points? Antonio showed some good touches and created a few things here and there. But overall they failed to convince.  Updated at 6.57pm BST    4.09pm   Full-time! Everton 1-0 West Ham  It\u2019s over! Lampard doesn\u2019t look sure if the final whistle has gone. But it sure has. He shakes hands with Moyes. Everton have their first win of the season. Lampard has his arm around Maupay, the match winner, and they both beam with delight.  Updated at 6.56pm BST    4.08pm    94 min: Scamacca and Gueye jump for a header in midfield. Scamacca appears to lead with an elbow and Gueye goes down in a heap. Tarkowski is incensed by the challenge and there is pushing and shoving. Scamacca is booked. McNeil was booked moments before. But closer and closer to the final whistle for Everton \u2026  Updated at 6.56pm BST    4.06pm    93 min: West Ham get a corner. It pinballs around the six-yard box momentarily but Everton eventually clear.     4.05pm    92 min: West Ham have it near the left corner flag as they attack. Cornet tries a backheel but it\u2019s nabbed by Everton who play it around and then burst out on the counterattack. Doucoure is advancing into space and has loads of options \u2013 he tries quite an ambitious switch of play from right to left but gets it completely wrong and it cannons off an opposition defender.  Updated at 6.56pm BST    4.03pm    90 min: Bowen goes down injured for West Ham. Lampard, sporting a black suit, directs affairs from the touchline. Moyes has his hands plunged into his pockets nearby. Everton have five minutes to hold on for their first, precious three points of the season.     4.02pm    90 min: Five minutes will be added on.     4.01pm    88 min: Everton\u2019s centre-backs get in a muddle after Bowen flicks a ball on. Suddenly it looks like Cornet is one-on-one but Patterson does brilliantly to get a little touch on the ball as his opponent is shaping to shoot. As a result, Cornet runs out of angle in which to get an effort on goal away. Nervous moments for Everton but they survive. Maupay comes off, Rondon comes on.  Updated at 4.30pm BST    4.00pm    86 min: Iwobi \u2013 another player who has been excellent in the second half \u2013 belts a shot goalwards. It\u2019s saved.     3.59pm    85 min: Moyes\u2019s face was indeed a picture of disappointment. He is entitled to expect more quality from Behrahma, there.      3.57pm    83 min: West Ham have the ball in the final third. A cross is aimed at Scamacca at the far post. He can\u2019t control it and it bounces out. However, West Ham win the ball back immediately in midfield thanks to Declan Rice, and he feeds the onrushing Cornet, who belts a powerful shot which is flying into the top corner \u2026 Begovic beats it out for a corner. Benrahma fluffs the corner completely and Moyes grimaces in disgust on the touchline.  Updated at 3.58pm BST    3.55pm    81 min: Gray was excellent today. Quite a big call to take him off, in fact, what with attack being the best form of defence and all that.     3.54pm    79 min: Doucoure is coming on for Everton. Onana is down receiving treatment on what looks like a knock to his right thigh. But it\u2019s Gray that is taken off and the former Watford midfield general, Doucoure, joins the action after recovering from a hamstring knock he sustained last month.     3.51pm    76 min: Gray, again, punches holes in the West Ham defence. He skips into the area and is upended up Kehrer. There are shouts for a penalty but it\u2019s a good challenge, the German defender wins the ball fair and square while taking a little bit of the man along with it.  Updated at 3.51pm BST    3.49pm    75 min: Lampard does turn to his bench. Dwight McNeil comes on for Gordon.  Updated at 3.49pm BST    3.48pm    74 min: What an effort by Benrahma. Soucek gets a foot in in midfield, an excellent tackle on Gueye, and Benrahma has space to take the ball towards the box, before unleashing a curling shot towards the far post, which thwacks off the woodwork and out! Begovic was a mere spectator there. It was a cheap way for Gueye to lose the ball in a dangerous area and Lampard will be having words after the home defence was left completely out of position as a result.   Updated at 6.54pm BST    3.46pm    73 min: Is Lampard going to call on his bench? You\u2019d have thought so. Moyes has made three changes.     3.44pm    71 min: West Ham are pushing a bit harder now. This is a significant test for Everton, having got the goal, can they close out the win?     3.43pm    70 min: Some applause for the late Queen.      3.40pm    67 min: West Ham build an attack into the Everton half. Cornet gets a touch and then it\u2019s with Cresswell, whose attempted cross is blocked out for a corner. Soucek meets the corner at the near post and glances it goalwards (or nearly goalwards) but it bounces out after Mykolenko at the far post ducks under it. That looked like a goal kick but West Ham get another corner. Nothing comes of that anyway. Now, here comes Gianluca Scamacca, West Ham\u2019s summer signing from Sassuolo. Could he nab a point for the Hammers?  Updated at 6.53pm BST    3.37pm    63 min: The Everton winger Gray with a beautiful bit of work on the left now, ghosting past Coufal and stroking a dangerous ball that flashes across the six-yard box. No one can get on the end of it.   Updated at 4.11pm BST    3.35pm    62 min: Everton stalwart Mary Waltz is satisfied with the goal: \u201cQuality pass into the box. Beautiful first touch, no hesitation, confident shot and goal. That is what we mean by quality. Messi, Ronaldo? No. But basic skill, yes.\u201d     3.34pm    61 min: Cornet and Benrahma come on for West Ham. Fornals and Paqueta go off.     3.33pm    59 min: Iwobi again is the man hurting this West Ham defence. He is released down the left and sprints on to the ball, bending a good low cross around the back-tracking defenders. It\u2019s a two-on-one \u2013 but Gordon is caught offside. Now West Ham, enlivened by conceding a goal, stream down to the other end and Bowen has a shot blocked. We\u2019ve got a ball game!  Updated at 3.33pm BST    3.30pm    56 min: Everton are suitably buoyed by the goal. Gray attacks again, then they win a corner. The crowd is up, the players are up. It looked a nailed on 0-0 in the first half, but Everton have been far better since half-time, attacking with real intent and fluency. Fair play to Lampard because whatever he said at half-time did the trick.     3.28pm    A really good finish by Maupay, who instantly controls the ball on the edge of the box, turns, and belts a right-footed finish low into the corner after the ball bounces up perfectly for him to hit (thanks to his silky touch).  Iwobi also deserves a ton of credit for the way he created it: he picked out Gray on the touchline, took the ball back from his teammate, and then picked out Maupay with a crisp and accurate pass. That was a lovely injection of pace and, yes, quality from Iwobi, and it got the finish it deserved from Maupay. His first goal for Everton.  Updated at 6.52pm BST    3.25pm   GOAL! Everton 1-0 West Ham (Maupay 53)  It\u2019s there! It\u2019s a goal!   Updated at 3.37pm BST    3.25pm    51 min: Antonio goes down injured for a bit. He is OK.      3.23pm    50 min: West Ham have had eight corners. Everton have had four. Defences are on top.     3.22pm    48 min: Bowen drills a shot over the crossbar, first-time, after (I think) Soucek crosses. At the other end, Iwobi sends a good pacy pass to Gray, who cuts in from the left wing, jinks away from his marker and bends a good on-target shot that Fabianski gathers.   Updated at 3.38pm BST    3.20pm    46 min: Mykolenko makes inroads on the Everton left. He slides a good ball across looking for Gray who has made a run to the near post. Zouma does well to cut the cross out and concede a corner. That was defending of quality from Zouma, and there was quality on the ball from Mykolenko too.     3.18pm   Second half kick-off!  Let\u2019s go! YES!     3.18pm    K\u00e1ri Tulinius adds: \u201cAmerican sports journalists Jon Bois and Alex Rubinstein once made the point in a video about baseball player Steve Jeltz, who was just about good enough to play in the Major League, but was outclassed by nearly everyone else there, that it\u2019s a harsh fate to be the worst of the best, forever held up to a near impossible standard. At least they are handsomely remunerated.\u201d Yes. Poor Everton and West Ham!     3.16pm    \u201cWatching the game on holiday in Tunisia,\u201d writes Christian. \u201cOne of the pundits almost fell asleep during the half time analysis. I know how he feels. Come on West Ham, I\u2019m missing the beach for this dross!!!\u201d     3.04pm    Half-time reading:        3.03pm   Half-time! Everton 0-0 West Ham  That was almost performance art. Twenty people ran around at top speed, in theory attempting to place the spherical object in the net, yet never once remotely threatening to succeed in their aim.  Updated at 3.03pm BST    3.01pm    43 min: West Ham win a corner as we approach half time. The ball is worked back to Cresswell and Everton completely fail to close him down. Cresswell thinks about shooting but then bends a ball in for Zouma, who meets it with a glancing header, which goes straight into the gloves of Begovic.     2.59pm    42 min: I sort of see what you mean, Adrian, these people are clearly capable footballers, but isn\u2019t that the point? In view of their training, and the vetting, and all the resources available to them, shouldn\u2019t we be seeing a little more composure, skill and \u2026 what\u2019s the word \u2026 quality?     2.58pm    41 min: An email arrives from Adrian Goldman: \u201c\u2018A real lack of quality\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little bit puzzled by this phrase - the people we are talking about are very well paid, went through extensive vetting processes - more than the current PM! - and each and every one of them is a member of the top 0.01-0.1% of all current football players on the planet.* (No, none of them are Lionel Messi). But I think the idea that they aren\u2019t, indeed, very, very good at what they do is more than a little bit demeaning and unfair.\u201d  Updated at 6.50pm BST    2.56pm    38 min: Everton attack. Maupay and Gordon link up, the former trying to play a low pass to his teammate. Everton win a corner. Nothing comes of it. Maybe we could and should have predicted that Lampard v Moyes would be high-tempo but short on attacking quality?   Updated at 6.49pm BST    2.54pm    37 min: What\u2019s going on? Not much. Antonio again uses his considerable presence to control the ball with his back to goal, on halfway, and launches another West Ham attack. The Hammers thread together a few passes. It ends when Paqueta launches a cross towards Antonio, but Begovic claims the ball.      2.50pm    33 min: More like it from Everton. Iwobi advances from midfield and feeds Maupay, before the ball is worked to Gray, popping up on the home team\u2019s left wing. Gray fires a good cross to the far post. But the defending from West Ham is solid.     2.48pm    32 min: David Moyes is wearing a nice charcoal grey sweater. \u201cThere\u2019s a real lack of quality,\u201d says Carragher on Sky Sports of the football on show, and you know what, he\u2019s spot on again.  Updated at 2.49pm BST    2.46pm    30 mins: This is, at least, not as dour as Villa v Saints from the other night. But it isn\u2019t very good. Someone needs to put their foot on it.  Updated at 2.47pm BST    2.45pm    28 min: Again with his back to goal, Antonio uses his body to turn beyond Coady, who is touch-tight. Coady knows he\u2019s been beaten and hacks Antonio to the floor instead of letting him run. Coady is booked. Lampard appears to be appealing for something from the ref while Coady committed that cynical foul. No idea what.  Updated at 2.45pm BST    2.43pm    26 min: West Ham win another corner. Paqueta climbs high to meet it with a header and manages to crank his neck back sufficiently to send the ball in the vague direction of the goal. Begovic catches it easily.   Updated at 3.01pm BST    2.42pm    25 min: Demarai Gray is \u201cthe one attacking player who\u2019s had a few good moments,\u201d opines Carragher on Sky Sports. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really happened for any of the attacking players on the pitch, just yet.\u201d He\u2019s right!     2.40pm    22 min: While I was checking my emails, West Ham won a few corners. Everton repelled the danger. This is like a lunchtime secondary-school playground encounter. Lots of running and shouting but not much cutting edge \u2026 On the plus side none of the players are trying to eat their cheese rolls while trying to compete in midfield.  Updated at 2.42pm BST    2.37pm    21 min: An email landed from Mary Waltz before kick-off! \u201cRooting for Everton for a decade and always had hopes for European play but usually had to settle for mid-table mediocrity. Last year was brutal and all I care about it somehow reaching the 40s in points and safety from relegation hell. I am waiting for the return of DCL the way some wait for the return of the world before Trump. Desperate and far from confident.\u201d  Updated at 6.48pm BST    2.36pm    19 min: It remains a breathless, high-tempo game. Both teams want this win, but neither are displaying a huge amount in the way of quality on the ball.      2.34pm    17 min: Antonio does well to bring the ball under control for West Ham near halfway, with his back to goal. He turns and embarks on a diagonal run into the danger zone \u2026 he tries to pick out Paqueta by cutting the ball across to the right but it\u2019s intercepted.  Updated at 2.35pm BST    2.33pm    15 min: Fornals makes a forward run for West Ham. He is crowded out. Gray gets on the ball for Everton and strides into space in the Hammers\u2019 half. West Ham are looking to defend pretty deep, allowing Everton space, and then trying to hit on the break. Gray tries to float a creative pass out right but he overhits it and it\u2019s out for a throw-in.  Updated at 6.47pm BST    2.31pm    Villa have beaten Man City 4-3 in the WSL:      2.30pm    13 min: Gueye fouls West Ham\u2019s Bowen in the centre of midfield, although not fast enough to stop Bowen firing a good-looking ball out to the West Ham left wing. Bowen needs treatment after the contact by Gueye, and gets back on his feet gingerly. He is OK to continue.   Updated at 6.47pm BST    2.28pm    10 min: This is lively stuff. Everton pour forward again. They win one corner, then Gray is fouled by Paqueta outside the box on the Everton right. Gray gets up to take the set-piece and floats it to the far post. Onana can\u2019t get over his header and sends it wide and high. The noise from the fans is deafening. Both teams are going for it.  Updated at 2.28pm BST    2.25pm    8 min: Big chance for West Ham! Bowen easily beats Mykolenko to the byline on the right and cuts a cross back looking for Antonio. Coady, the last line of defence, does very well to block the ball and knock it out for a corner back past the near post. Antonio would have had an open goal and a tap-in, because Begovic has been taken out of the game completely by the low ball pinged across by Bowen. Very poor from Mykolenko, he was beaten far too easily, but very good from Coady.  Updated at 6.46pm BST    2.24pm    7 min: Maupay gets on the ball in an advanced central area and slides a ball to Iwobi \u2026 Iwobi cannot control it and it goes out for a goal kick.     2.22pm    5 min: As Jamie Carragher points out on commentary for Sky Sports, if there is a positive result either way in this fixture, the loser will find themselves stuck in the bottom three during the international break. Everton are currently 17th and West Ham are 18th. Patterson bends a deep cross in from the Everton right: Fabianski claims it comfortably.  Updated at 6.45pm BST    2.19pm    2 min: A pretty high-tempo start but not much in the way of quality just yet. Paqueta lays off a decent ball to the left wing but Everton snuff out the danger. Everton stream forward, but Fornals does well to win a 50-50 ball near halfway, and then hares into space \u2026 West Ham win a corner.   Updated at 2.39pm BST    2.16pm   First half kick-off!  West Ham get the game going. Can Everton win and inflict West Ham\u2019s 1000th league defeat?     2.15pm    The ceremonials are out of the way. Let\u2019s play some football! Or certainly watch some.     2.13pm    It\u2019s time for a minute\u2019s silence in memory of Queen Elizabeth II. There are some boos audible and they come from the home fans, reports Will Unwin.  Updated at 2.14pm BST    2.11pm    The fearsome atmospheres that were created to help fire Everton to safety at the end of last season have been replaced. Goodison Park is subdued due to the state of the team; they have failed to win a league game this season, their main striker is yet to feature and Jordan Pickford is out injured. The fans are here in hope currently, rather than expectation.     2.10pm    David Moyes has a quick chat about his new players: \u201cThe problem is the amount of games ... it\u2019s finding time [in training] to work with them.\u201d     2.10pm    Lampard speaks to Sky Sports, firstly about Idrissa Gueye in midfield: \u201cHe gives us experience and quality ... [James] Garner comes in [on the bench], a young player, with a lot of potential. \u201cWe\u2019re playing pretty well ... we\u2019re competing very well ... can we do it again against a very good team, and get that win which will give us confidence going into the break?\u201d     2.05pm    Will Unwin is our man on the scene at Goodison Park, and he reports that it has stopped raining. Good news. The surface will be nice and greasy, which will perfectly suit the fluent attacking game we are going to see from both sides.     2.00pm    In the WSL, Sarah Rendell is live-blogging a thriller here: Aston Villa and Man City are drawing 3-3 with about just under 20 minutes to play\u201d      1.58pm    Arsenal are top of the league with 18 points from seven matches heading into the international break. They will next be in action in the Premier League against Tottenham, on Saturday 1 October, so that should be a spicy one.  Updated at 1.58pm BST    1.56pm    Cardiff have announced the departure of manager Steve Morison in the wake of Saturday\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Huddersfield. Morison, who took over on a permanent basis in November last year, leaves with the club 18th in the Championship.      1.52pm    Arsenal have just brought on Ethan Nwaneri \u2026 he is 15 years old. FIFTEEN! And he thus becomes the youngest ever Premier League player. \u201cThe Arsenal\u201d are beating Brentford 3-0.      1.49pm    Andy Hunter wrote that at the back end of last week, of course, long before the team was announced, and there is still no sign of Dominic Calvert-Lewin today. We are probably unlikely to see a glut of goals this afternoon, but let\u2019s not give up hope.      1.48pm    Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s status as Harry Kane\u2019s understudy looked secure in the England hierarchy 14 months ago, when he replaced the captain in the Euro 2020 quarter-final win over Ukraine. He has not played for the country since, and this week saw Brentford\u2019s in-form Ivan Toney named in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for England\u2019s final internationals before the World Cup. Qatar now appears a distant hope for the 25-year-old, who has been restricted to just 18 appearances for Everton since winning his last cap due to toe, thigh and knee injuries. Frank Lampard has been desperate for Calvert-Lewin\u2019s presence all season and, despite signing Neal Maupay, claimed the centre-forward\u2019s return diminished the need to add another striker in the transfer window. Goals remain a serious problem for a team without a Premier League win this season but, having resumed training during the enforced break, Calvert-Lewin should soon have opportunity to repay his manager\u2019s faith and perhaps send a late message to Southgate.  Updated at 1.49pm BST    1.44pm    Half an hour until kick-off. Have you been affected by Everton\u2019s relegation battle last season? Are you a West Ham fan? We want to hear from you. You can email me or tweet.     1.42pm    Gary Naylor, meanwhile, thinks I\u2019m being harsh on Lamps. As I said, I think the jury is still out. Lampard clearly had a big say in the successful battle against relegation, but that begs the question if he could and should have made it safe before that?   Updated at 1.43pm BST    1.39pm    Jon reckons it\u2019s going to be a draw.  I can confidently tell you what the score will be before the game even starts: 0-0.     1.27pm    For the avoidance of doubt, the kick-off time is 2.15pm and not 2.30pm, as may have previously been advertised on this blog.     1.25pm   The teams  Everton: Begovic, Patterson, Coady, Tarkowski, Mykolenko, Gueye, Onana, Iwobi, Gray, Maupay, Gordon. Substitutes: Keane, McNeil, Doucoure, Coleman, Davies, Ruben Vinagre, Rondon, Jakupovic, Garner. West Ham: Fabianski, Kehrer, Zouma, Cresswell, Coufal, Soucek, Rice, Fornals, Bowen, Lucas Paqueta, Antonio. Substitutes: Scamacca, Lanzini, Downes, Areola, Cornet, Dawson, Ogbonna, Benrahma, Emerson Palmieri. Referee: Michael Oliver (England) Idrissa Gueye makes his first start for Everton since returning from Paris Saint Germain over the summer. The injured goalie Jordan Pickford is replaced by Asmir Begovic. Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 is recovering from a hamstring injury and is deemed fit enough for a place on the bench but there is no Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the squad as he continues his recovery from a knee injury. For West Ham, Lucas Paqueta makes his first start. Gianluca Scamacca drops to the bench following his goal against Silkeborg in the midweek win in the Europa Conference League. Lukasz Fabianski, Jarrod Bowen, Kurt Zouma, Pablo Fornals are all back into the starting lineup after being rested in midweek.   Updated at 2.08pm BST    1.15pm   Preamble  Is Frank Lampard a top-level football manager? The jury is still out but this season \u2013 and therefore to a certain extent this afternoon\u2019s match against West Ham \u2013 should provide the answer. David Moyes, who spent more than 11 years managing at Goodison Park, returns to face his former employers today. His long tenure at Everton divided opinion among fans: some felt he was a highly effective operator for a club of Everton\u2019s stature, while others believed he was overly conservative and prevented the club from achieving their potential. Moyes\u2019s career since he departed has neither confirmed nor disproved those opposing views. Was he out of his depth at Manchester United or was he on a hiding to nothing at what has become a deeply dysfunctional club? Has he over-achieved at West Ham, or should they have sustained last season\u2019s push for the top four? Is Lampard destined for a similarly mixed, Moyesian career? Following a narrow escape from an unthinkable relegation last campaign, Lampard is still searching for a first Premier League victory in the 2022-23 season. If he is going to prove he belongs as a manager at this level, Everton should really be dispatching the likes of West Ham, where he began his playing career, at home. Team news and more will be coming right up. Kick-off: 2.15pm  Updated at 1.25pm BST "

                    "body": "If Old Firm derbies define a Scottish season, it is fitting Sunday\u2019s version sums up the curious nature of the campaign to date.\nA Celtic success, the most likely outcome, would all but confirm the reclaiming of the Premiership title. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s team would be nine points and at least 20 goals ahead of Rangers with three matches to play.\nYet an alternative scenario cannot be completely discounted, demonstrated by Rangers\u2019 deserved success over their oldest foes in the Scottish Cup semi-final on 17 April.\n\nRangers\u2019 season has been one of epic highs \u2013 that Hampden triumph and victory over Borussia Dortmund en route to the Europa League semi-final \u2013 but horrible lows. It has been forgotten that the 10 men of Malm\u00f6 bundled Rangers out of the Champions League at the qualifying phase. On Boxing Day, Rangers held a seemingly unassailable six-point lead at the summit; subsequent stumbles against Aberdeen, Ross County and Dundee United plus a trouncing at Celtic Park collided with Postecoglou\u2019s side finding their sweet spot.\nIt is unfair to declare Giovanni van Bronckhorst\u2019s appointment as the successor to Steven Gerrard as a mistake. Rangers\u2019 European run, very much alive despite a 1-0 defeat to RB Leipzig on Thursday, is worthy of huge respect. Should Rangers take the ultimate Europa League prize \u2013 another possibility it would be unwise to laugh off \u2013 domestic failings will barely matter.\nFor now, given Celtic lie in immediate opposition, it is merely fair to highlight the contrasting fortunes of sides who were separated by 25 points, in Rangers\u2019 favour, when last season concluded.\n\nIt may be denied now, but a noisy percentage of the Rangers support declared contentment when Gerrard hot-footed it to Villa Park in November. There was a sense Rangers had gone stale under the former Liverpool captain and that he had grown disillusioned with transfer business. \nVan Bronckhorst, afforded immediate love-bombing as a former Rangers player, was widely portrayed as the right man at the right time. That he was freely available and had an existing connection with Rangers\u2019 omnipresent sporting director, Ross Wilson, helped.\nVan Bronckhorst, of course, has wandered into exactly the same situation as Gerrard at least looked irritated by. Rangers\u2019 January transfer window included the vanity loan of Aaron Ramsey and the even more bizarre capture of Amad Diallo on loan from Manchester United. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted that we have been able to convince both Manchester United and Amad that Rangers is the perfect place for him to continue to showcase his undoubted and exciting talent,\u201d said Wilson.\nThe longest Diallo has managed in a Rangers shirt is 70 minutes, in a cup tie against Annan Athletic. When Rangers needed to kick on \u2013 which also applied last summer \u2013 they added Mateusz Zukowski and James Sands, who have had minimal or zero impact. Van Bronckhorst has displayed a strange aversion to Steven Davis, who remains more than capable of influencing games in Scotland despite his veteran status.\n\nNone of this is to state categorically that Rangers are in a state of crisis. It is merely that the extent of their league lapse has been disguised by their Europa League exploits. In Leipzig, there was a diligence and shape to Rangers. At Hampden, Van Bronckhorst\u2019s players rattled Celtic in a fashion not witnessed since the fraught early days of the Postecoglou era. Therein lies the epitome of a weird seasonal narrative.\nShould Postecoglou preside over an immediate rebound from semi-final pain, he should be regarded as Scotland\u2019s manager of the season. The League Cup, won by a piece of genius from one of the players Postecoglou coaxed from Japan, Kyogo Furuhashi, is already housed at Celtic Park.\nAdding the title may draw shrugs from those who not unreasonably regard the Scottish top flight in the context of bald men and combs but the scale of rebuild required after a calamitous last campaign means Postecoglou is worthy of immense credit.\nCeltic\u2019s board believe in their manager to the point where he will inevitably be backed heavily in the summer. Unknowns surrounding what Rangers can or will do in the same window demonstrate sharply shifting sands."

                    "body": "A posh hot chocolate used to just mean adding marshmallows and whipped cream, but these days it is all about the cocoa percentage as retailers selling luxury single-origin drinks set out to conquer the high street. The fast-growing brand Knoops sells more than 20 different types of hot chocolate in its shops ranked by strength, from a sweet and creamy 28% white all the way up to an intense 100% extra dark. To navigate a menu that looks like a periodic table, each drink has tasting notes. Expect \u201cnotes of cherries and black tea\u201d from the 70% single-origin chocolate from Congo while the 80%, from Uganda, is \u201cearthy with a subtle smokiness\u201d. Single origin refers to the fact the beans used to create it come from one source.  \u201cThe feedback we get from customers is they are bored with coffee and want something new,\u201d says the company\u2019s founder Jens Knoop. \u201cThey want something interesting and \u2018next level\u2019, which is single-origin chocolate from around the world.\u201d Knoop, who is originally from Germany, opened his first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013. Since then he has spent 10,000 hours perfecting its drinks by combining different percentage cocoas with different milks, including plant milks, as well as fruits, roots and spices. The adventurous, already familiar with chocolate strengths from sophisticated supermarket ranges, can go further still: picking from a list of 20 extras that includes Szechuan pepper, star anise, turmeric and rosemary. At 54% and above the drinks are suitable for vegans. Britons are following the same path with hot chocolate that they have trodden with coffee, according to food analysts, who point to the rapid shift from drinking instant coffee to owning coffee machines and taking out high-end bean subscriptions. This growing awareness \u2013 coupled with more time at home during lockdown \u2013 has led to bumper sales of the kit needed to make hot chocolate at home, with everything from \u00a3160 Smeg machines to \u00a325 shakers and stirring spoons flying off the shelves. John Lewis\u2019s hot chocolate sales more than doubled in the past six months of 2021 compared with the prior year. The market leader, Hotel Chocolat, which has blazed the trail on the high street with its posh chocolate, says it has now sold \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of its Velvetiser machine. Fans can take out a monthly subscription for its hot chocolate flakes which come in exotic flavours such as black forest gateau and Mayan chilli and cinnamon. Angus Thirwell, the Hotel Chocolat chief executive, says the only hot chocolate available used to be terrible \u2013 basically a \u201csugar-based powder that looked brown\u201d. \u201cYou put a couple of teaspoons of that into a cup, poured on some boiling water and created what passed as hot chocolate for many decades in the UK. \u201cOnce people taste what can be possible, it\u2019s synonymous with the journey from instant coffee to drinking proper coffee. It\u2019s getting back to that authentic taste of the beans, and it applies as much to the cacao bean as it does to the coffee bean.\u201d Knoops, which also sells its hot chocolate flakes on its website, was also a lockdown hit. \u201cWhen people couldn\u2019t go into the shops they bought our flakes and the chocolate makers to recreate the experience at home,\u201d said Knoop. With a growing fanbase, the small chain plans to open 10 more stores in the next 12 months.  In Knoops\u2019 west London flagship store, the students Anne-Catherine Xhonneux and Dan Menendez are catching up over a 72% and a 73%. \u201cI really like hot chocolate so I like to be able to choose the percentage,\u201d says Xhonneux. Her drink is from Peru and promises hints of caramel and cashew and she can taste the \u201cnuttiness\u201d. Menendez could expect \u201ccitrus, honey and caramel\u201d, but says his taste buds haven\u2019t been the same since he had Covid. At weekends, troops of teenagers queue up to buy Knoop\u2019s hot chocolate, but he says the appeal is across all ages and pockets, from office workers to gym goers, retirees and families enjoying a weekend treat. Its drinks start at about \u00a33 but, for those brave enough to order one, a large 100% from Solomon Islands costs \u00a36.20. After the hiatus caused by the lockdowns, Britons have sought out the experience of visiting high-street coffee shops again, says Jeffrey Young, the chief executive of consultancy Allegra Strategies, with sales approaching 90% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. \u201cIf nothing else, Covid taught us that coffee shops are part of the fabric of our society,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get hot chocolate in most places but these premium specialists are carving out a niche.\u201d If you take the long view, chocolate houses are not new, adds Thirlwell. \u201cWe\u2019re rediscovering what we lost. In the 1700s in London, there were more chocolate houses than coffee shops.\u201d"

                    "body": "  1.05am   Summary  Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is currently 3am in the capital Kyiv. We will be pausing our live reporting overnight and returning in the morning. In the meantime, you can read our comprehensive summary of the days\u2019 events in our summary below.  Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he expects Russia will intensify attacks on Ukraine and possibly other European countries after the EU Commission proposed it as a candidate for EU membership. \u201cObviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities,\u201d he said in a nightly video address. \u201cAnd not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready. We warn partners.\u201d   Ukraine\u2019s forces remain on the defensive in the eastern Donbas region, where fighting continues in Sievierodonestsk. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russia was massing forces in an attempt to take full control of the city after weeks of fighting but maintained that \u201call Russian claims that they control the town are a lie\u201d. \u201cThey control the main part of the town, but not the whole town,\u201d he told Ukrainian television.   European Union foreign ministers will discuss ways to free millions of tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. It is hoped a deal can be struck to resume Ukraine\u2019s sea exports in return for facilitating Russian food and fertiliser exports but remains unclear if the EU would get involved in militarily securing such a deal. \u201cWhether there will be a need in the future for escorting these commercial ships, that\u2019s a question mark and I don\u2019t think we are there yet,\u201d an EU official said.   The war in Ukraine could last for years and will require long-term military support, according to Nato and other western leaders. \u201cWe must prepare for the fact that it could take years,\u201d Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild on Sunday. British prime minister, Boris Johnson, added: \u201cI am afraid that we need to steel ourselves for a long war.\u201d   Ukraine\u2019s parliament voted through two laws on Sunday which will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music. Proposed laws will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, banning the commercial import of books printed in Russia and prohibiting the playing of music by post-1991 Russian citizens on media and on public transport in the latest attempt to break cultural ties between the two countries.   The New York Times identified over 2,000 munitions used by Russian forces in Ukraine, \u201ca vast majority of which were unguided.\u201d According to the newspaper, over 210 weapons that were identified were types that have been widely banned under a variety of international treaties.   Austria\u2019s government announced that it will reopen a mothballed coal power station because of power shortages arising from reduced deliveries of gas from Russia. The authorities would work with the Verbund group, the country\u2019s main electricity supplier, to get the station in the southern city of Mellach back in action, the chancellery said on Sunday.   Morocco\u2019s national human rights body has urged Russian authorities to guarantee a \u201cfair trial\u201d for a young national appealing a death sentence imposed by a pro-Russian court in Ukraine. Amina Bouayach, president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), has contacted the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation and urged the Russian body to take \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure Brahim Saadoun receives a fair trial during his appeal.\u201d       12.44am    Successful Ukrainian counterattacks in the Zaporizhia area are forcing Russian forces to rush reinforcements to this weakened sector of the front line, the institute for the study of war has said in its latest update.  Russian forces focused on maintaining their occupied frontiers north of the city of Kharkiv and fired at Ukrainian positions in the Kharkiv region on Sunday, the report added.  According to the policy research organisation, Russian forces are also likely seek to levy their attempts to interdict the T1302 Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway to support offensive operations in Lysychansk.   Updated at 12.46am BST    12.04am   Ukraine to restrict Russian books and music, cutting cultural ties  Ukraine\u2019s parliament has voted through two laws which will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music in an attempt to break cultural ties between the two countries. One law will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, unless they renounce their Russian passport and take Ukrainian citizenship. The ban will only apply to those who held Russian citizenship after the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule, Reuters reports. It will also ban the commercial import of books printed in Russia, Belarus, and occupied Ukrainian territory, while also requiring special permission for the import of books in Russian from any other country. Another law will prohibit the playing of music by post-1991 Russian citizens on media and on public transport, while also increasing quotas on Ukrainian-language speech and music content in TV and radio broadcasts. The laws need to be signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to take effect, and there is no indication that he opposes either. Both received broad support from across the chamber, including from lawmakers who had traditionally been viewed as pro-Kremlin by most of Ukraine\u2019s media and civil society. Ukraine\u2019s Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said he was \u201cglad to welcome\u201d the new restrictions.  The laws are designed to help Ukrainian authors share quality content with the widest possible audience, which after the Russian invasion do not accept any Russian creative product on a physical level,\u201d the Ukrainian cabinet\u2019s website quoted him as saying.   The new rules are the latest chapter in Ukraine\u2019s long path to shedding the legacy of hundreds of years of rule by Moscow. Ukraine says this process, previously referred to as \u201cdecommunisation\u201d but now more often called \u201cderussification,\u201d is necessary to undo centuries of policies aimed at crushing Ukrainian identity.  Updated at 12.07am BST    11.35pm   EU foreign minister to discuss how to free grain stuck in Ukraine  European Union foreign ministers will discuss ways to free millions of tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine due to Russia\u2019s Black Sea port blockade at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. Ukraine is one of the top wheat suppliers globally, but its grain shipments have stalled and more than 20m tonnes have been trapped in silos since Russia\u2019s invaded the country and blocked its ports. The EU supports efforts by the United Nations to broker a deal to resume Ukraine\u2019s sea exports in return for facilitating Russian food and fertiliser exports, but that would need Moscow\u2019s green light. Turkey has good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow, and has said it is ready to take up a role within an \u201cobservation mechanism\u201d based in Istanbul if there is a deal. It is unclear if the EU would get involved in militarily securing such a deal.  Whether there will be a need in the future for escorting these commercial ships, that\u2019s a question mark and I don\u2019t think we are there yet,\u201d an EU official said.  Meanwhile, talks among EU member states on a new package of sanctions against Russia are continuing, according to the EU official who signalled that fresh measures are not imminent. The existing sanctions are already extensive and there is not much scope for agreement to impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s gas exports to the EU, the official said.      11.19pm    Ukraine has just thanked Australia for sending four armoured vehicles to the war-torn country.  Ukraine will not forget this. Another batch of Australian armoured vehicles are on their way to Ukraine.  These are four of the 14 M113 armoured personnel carriers promised by the Australian government. A half-world-long aviation aid bridge unites our people in these difficult times for Ukraine.\u201d       11.03pm   Summary  It\u2019s 1am in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where things stand:   Austria\u2019s government announced Sunday that it would reopen a mothballed coal power station because of power shortages arising from reduced deliveries of gas from Russia. The authorities would work with the Verbund group, the country\u2019s main electricity supplier, to get the station in the southern city of Mellach back in action, said the chancellery. Russia has deported over 300,000 Ukrainian children since its invasion of Ukraine in February, the Kyiv Independent reports. In total, 1.9 million Ukrainians have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to the report.  Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced on Sunday that he expects Russia to intensify attacks on Ukraine after the EU Commission proposed it as a candidate for EU membership. \u201cObviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities, as an example,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. The New York Times has identified over 2,000 munitions used by Russian forces in Ukraine, \u201ca vast majority of which were unguided.\u201d According to the outlet, over 210 weapons that were identified were types that have been widely banned under a variety of international treaties. Russia is preparing for an offensive towards the city of Sloviansk in Donetsk, the Kyiv Independent reports. Additionally, according to the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces, Ukrainian troops are repelling a Russian offensive near Berestove, a town approximately 70km from Sloviansk. Ukraine\u2019s parliament adopted new laws on Sunday, including a ban on publications imported from Russia and Belarus. Other news laws adopted included prohibition of public performance of music \u201cof the Russian region\u201d and the exemption of military personnel \u201cinvolved in hostilities\u201d from the country\u2019s special war tax. Morocco\u2019s national human rights body has urged Russian authorities to guarantee a \u201cfair trial\u201d for a young national appealing a death sentence imposed by a pro-Russian court in Ukraine. Amina Bouayach, president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), has contacted the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation and urged the Russian body to take \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure Brahim Saadoun receives a fair trial during his appeal.\u201d   \u2022 This post was amended on 20 June 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that 1.9 million Ukrainians have been deported to Russia since the invasion, not from Russia as an earlier version said. That\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand over the blog to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock, who will bring you the latest updates on Ukraine. Thank you.   Updated at 2.04pm BST    10.29pm    Austria\u2019s government announced Sunday that it would reopen a mothballed coal power station because of power shortages arising from reduced deliveries of gas from Russia. Agence France-Presse reports:  The authorities would work with the Verbund group, the country\u2019s main electricity supplier, to get the station in the southern city of Mellach back in action, said the chancellery. The statement followed a crisis meeting of the government. The aim is to be able to once again produce electricity from coal, should that be required in an emergency. But the process would likely take several months, the environment ministry told Austria\u2019s APA news agency. Mellach power station, which was the country\u2019s last coal-fuelled power station, closed in the spring of 2020 as the government phased out polluting energy in a bid to move to 100 percent renewables.  \u201cOur first objective is to secure the country\u2019s supply,\u201d said Austria\u2019s conservative chancellor, Karl Nehammer, who governs with the Greens.  But 80% of the country\u2019s gas supplies come from Russia, he explained.  This is about replacing the missing Russian gas with other sources or suppliers so as to be able to continue to build up reserve.  Moscow has lost several European gas clients after it demanded that all \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries pay for Russian natural gas in rubles in response to a barrage of western sanctions over Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine. Gazprom has said exports to countries that did not belong to the former Soviet Union were down 28.9% between January 1 and June 15 compared with the same period last year.  Updated at 10.34pm BST    9.53pm    Russia has deported over 300,000 Ukrainian children since its invasion of Ukraine in February, the Kyiv Independent reports.       9.23pm    Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced on Sunday that he expects Russia to intensify attacks on Ukraine after the EU Commission proposed it as a candidate for EU membership.   Obviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities, as an example,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. \u201cAnd not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready.\u201d     Updated at 12.30am BST    8.56pm    The New York Times has identified over 2,000 munitions used by Russian forces in Ukraine, \u201ca vast majority of which were unguided\u201d. According to the outlet, over 210 weapons that were identified were types that have been widely banned under a variety of international treaties. \u201cAll but a handful were cluster munitions, including their submunitions, which can pose a grave risk to civilians for decades after war has ended,\u201d the New York Times said, adding: \u201cMore than 330 other weapons appeared to have been used on or near civilian structures.\u201d   Updated at 9.01pm BST    8.18pm    Russia is preparing for an offensive towards the city of Sloviansk in Donetsk, the Kyiv Independent reports.  Additionally, according to the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces, Ukrainian troops are repelling a Russian offensive near Berestove, a town approximately 70km from Sloviansk.    Updated at 8.20pm BST    7.43pm    Ukraine\u2019s parliament adopted new laws on Sunday, including a ban on publications imported from Russia and Belarus.  Other news laws adopted included prohibition of public performance of music \u201cof the Russian region\u201d and the exemption of military personnel \u201cinvolved in hostilities\u201d from the country\u2019s special war tax.       7.12pm    Morocco\u2019s national human rights body has urged Russian authorities to guarantee a \u201cfair trial\u201d for a young national appealing a death sentence imposed by a pro-Russian court in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse reports:  Brahim Saadoun, a Moroccan citizen born in 2000, was sentenced to death on June 9 along with two British men by a court in Donetsk, a self-proclaimed statelet in eastern Ukraine. The trio have been accused of acting as mercenaries for Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbour. Amina Bouayach, president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), has contacted the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation, a source from the Moroccan rights council told AFP on Sunday. She has urged the Russian body to take \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure Brahim Saadoun receives a fair trial during his appeal,\u201d the source said.  Taher Saadoun, father of the accused, has said his son, who obtained Ukrainian citizenship in 2020, \u201cis not a mercenary\u201d, calling him instead a \u201cvictim of manipulation\u201d.  But Dmytro Khrabstov, 20, a friend of Saadoun, has said the Moroccan joined the Ukrainian military last year, telling friends he wanted to \u201cdie as a hero\u201d. The Moroccan government had not responded until last Monday, saying through its embassy in Ukraine that Saadoun \u201cwas captured while wearing the uniform of the army of the state of Ukraine, as a member of the Ukrainian marine unit\u201d.  It said he was \u201ccurrently imprisoned by an entity that is recognised by neither the United Nations nor Morocco\u201d, without commenting further.  Morocco has taken a position of neutrality at the United Nations on the war in Ukraine. The move reflects Rabat\u2019s desire to avoid alienating Russia, a member of the UN Security Council, on the question of the disputed Western Sahara, a key Moroccan diplomatic priority. Morocco controls 80 percent of the disputed former Spanish colony and insists the territory must remain under its sovereignty, while the Algeria-backed Polisario Front movement seeks independence.      6.37pm    UK ministers will change visa rules and now allow unaccompanied Ukrainian minors to enter the UK, The Times reports.  The new rule change will allow hundreds of stranded children and teenage refugees to enter the UK.  The change comes to an existing rule that currently prohibits individuals under 18 years old who are without a parent or guardian from entering the UK.        5.54pm    Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based thinktank, wrote in a note that \u201cRussian forces will likely be able to seize the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk in the coming weeks, but at the cost of concentrating most of their available forces in this small area\u201d.  Gaining full control of the Luhansk region \u2013 one of the two provinces making up the Donbas \u2013 is now a top target for Russian forces, as part of a larger focus on trying to take complete control of the Donbas.  In Sievierodonetsk\u2019s twin city of Lysychansk, residential buildings and private houses had been destroyed, Gaidai said. \u201cPeople are dying on the streets and in bomb shelters,\u201d he said, adding that 19 people had been evacuated on Sunday.  The mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, Ihor Terekhov, said he would cancel a planned trip to Madrid to discuss the city\u2019s reconstruction with Norman Foster and other architects due to the uncertainty caused by increased bombardment, Reuters reports. In southern Ukraine, western weaponry had helped Ukrainian forces advance 10km (6 miles) towards Russian-occupied Melitopol, its mayor said in a video posted on Telegram from outside the city.   Updated at 6.05pm BST    5.41pm    Ukraine has hailed the release of a celebrated medic whose footage was smuggled out of the besieged city of Mariupol in a tampon by a team of journalists in mid-March. \u201cI always believed that everything would be exactly this, and everyone who is now on the other side, they know everything will work out,\u201d Yuliia Paievska said in a video address on Saturday in which she thanked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for her release. My colleague Pjotr Sauer has more.   Updated at 5.45pm BST    5.06pm    The Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank president, Loretta Mester, has said it will take two years for inflation to come down to the central bank\u2019s 2% target.  \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be immediate that we see 2% inflation. It will take a couple of years but it will be moving down,\u201d Mester said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday.  Voices from across the political spectrum bemoaning high inflation and debating its causes in recent weeks have underlined that many fear sanctions against Russia, as well as other support measures for Ukraine, are among the developments that are primarily to blame for the economic turmoil, which suggests that the support from the public the Ukrainian resistance campaign has enjoyed so far across the west could fizzle out. On social media, many have taken to blaming Joe Biden personally for the high levels of inflation over the past few days, citing unprecedented pandemic stimulus measures he introduced as main causes for the current crisis alongside western sanctions. President Biden appeared to respond to these critics on Friday, tweeting that the global energy crisis was fuelled by Russia and describing this as the driver of inflation worldwide.    Updated at 5.28pm BST    3.41pm    Here is an interesting thread from NPR\u2019s Tim Mak on the phenomenon of \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d:        3.11pm    Italian foreign minister Luigi Di Maio on Sunday accused his own Five Star Movement party of undermining government efforts to support Ukraine and Rome\u2019s international reputation. Reuters reports:  His outburst could signal an imminent schism in the group he once led, with Five Star officials due to meet later on Sunday to consider Di Maio\u2019s position following other recent broadsides.  The internal party feuding also creates problems for prime minister Mario Draghi as he faces an important vote in parliament on Tuesday over Ukraine, with some Five Star members looking to limit Italy from sending further weapons to Kyiv.  Italy, like many EU countries, has been dispatching arms to Ukraine to help it battle the Russian assault.  In a statement, Di Maio said the government had to defend the values of democracy and freedom, adding that while everyone wanted peace, Russian president Vladimir Putin was pursuing war.  Against this backdrop, he said Five Star leaders were attacking him with \u201chatred\u201d and causing trouble for the government with its European partners. \u201c[This is] an immature attitude that tends to create tensions and instability within the government,\u201d he added.  There was no immediate comment from Five Star leader, former prime minister Giuseppe Conte. Earlier on Sunday, one of Conte\u2019s loyalists, Riccardo Ricciardi, said Di Maio had turned on his political family and should face the consequences. Five Star is the largest political force in parliament after winning 33% of the vote in 2018 national elections. Its fortunes have however suffered since then as it lost its anti-establishment identity once in government. Latest opinion polls put it on around 13% and it won barely 3% of the vote in local elections last weekend.  Di Maio blamed the rout on Conte, while the latter said Five Star was paying a price for being in Draghi\u2019s broad coalition. Party officials said he was lashing out because the Five Star leadership had said it would enforce an old rule that its members cannot stand for re-election after two consecutive terms in parliament - a measure that would stop Di Maio from being a candidate next time around. If Di Maio leaves the party, a band of supporters might follow him and create a breakaway party inside parliament, bringing fresh turbulence to Draghi\u2019s administration.    I\u2019m Jedidajah Otte and taking back over now for the next few hours.  Updated at 4.12pm BST    2.45pm    AFP has this map showing the latest positions of military forces:      2.27pm    A couple in Kharkiv oblast prepare food for people who have been living in a shelter near the frontline for three months as Russian attacks on Ukraine continue:    Updated at 2.39pm BST    2.14pm    Italian company Eni has joined Qatar Energy\u2019s $28.75bn (\u00a323.5bn) project to expand production \u2013 just days after Russia reduced gas supplies to Italy. Eni will have a stake of just over 3% in the North Field East project, Qatar Energy\u2019s CEO said at the signing ceremony in Doha, Reuters reports.  Russia supplies 40% of the European Union\u2019s natural gas, but the EU has pledged to cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year.  Qatar Energy estimates that the North Field East project contains about 10% of the world\u2019s known gas reserves.  Updated at 2.22pm BST    1.45pm    The UK military must be prepared to \u201cfight in Europe once again\u201d, the new head of the British army has said. Boris Johnson has ruled out sending British troops in aid of Ukraine, but warned this weekend that the country would have to show support for \u201cthe long haul\u201d. Patrick Sanders, who took command of the British army this month, is quoted in the i newspaper to have told troops:   We are the generation that must prepare the army to fight in Europe once again. There is now a burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies and defeating Russia in battle. I am the first Chief of the General Staff since 1941 to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a continental power.\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose \u2013 to protect the UK by being ready to fight and win wars on land.\u201d  Hello, I\u2019m Clea Skopeliti and I\u2019m covering the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break.  Updated at 1.53pm BST    1.32pm     The UN\u2019s World Food Programme has warned on Sunday that food rations for refugees in east and west Africa have had to be reduced due to a surge in demand and insufficient funding.  Three-quarters of refugees in east Africa supported by the United Nations\u2019 programme have seen their rations reduced by up to 50%, WFP said, with those in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda the worst affected.  \u201cWe are being forced to make the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival,\u201d said WFP executive director David Beasley.  Available resources could not keep up with the soaring demand for food around the globe, he said.  In west Africa - specifically Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger - WFP had \u201csignificantly\u201d reduced rations.   It warned of imminent disruptions in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.  On Tuesday, the WFP appealed for $426m to stave off famine in South Sudan, where years of conflict and floods have forced millions of people from their homes.  It said more than two-thirds of the population required humanitarian assistance, with 8.3 million people, including refugees, expected to face \u201csevere acute hunger\u201d this year.  The war in Ukraine has significantly worsened the global refugee crisis and the risk of famine, as it created six million additional refugees fleeing conflict zones, and has driven up commodity prices, especially the cost of grain.  On Saturday, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Russia of choosing to \u201cweaponise\u201d grain exports by blocking grain from Ukraine destined for poor countries, AFP reports.   Updated at 1.55pm BST    1.03pm     Germany will adopt emergency measures to ensure its energy needs are met after the drop in supply of Russian gas, including increased use of coal, the government said Sunday.  \u201cTo reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,\u201d the economy ministry said in a statement.  Robert Habeck, the minister for economic affairs and climate action, said bringing back coal-fired power plants was \u201cpainful, but it is a sheer necessity\u201d.  In addition, an auction model for the sale of gas to manufacturers is to be launched in the summer, intended to encourage industrial gas consumers to save gas - which is then to be stored, the dpa reports. Coal-fired power plants that are currently only operating to a limited extent, will soon be shut down or are in reserve are to be used to supply energy. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe.  The decision by Berlin marks a turnaround by the ruling coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and the liberal FDP, which has vowed to wind down its coal usage by 2030.  So far, Germany has managed to reduce the share of its natural gas supplied by Russia from 55 percent before the invasion to 35 percent - thanks to increased deliveries from countries like Norway and the Netherlands, and through liquefied natural gas contracts (LNG).   Updated at 1.56pm BST    12.40pm    Russia said on Sunday its offensive against Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine was proceeding successfully after it took control of a district in the outskirts of the city.  \u201cThe offensive in the Sievierodonetsk direction is developing successfully,\u201d Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a video statement. He said the settlement of Metyolkine, on the eastern outskirts of the city, had been taken.  \u201cThe armed forces of the Russian Federation continue to strike military targets on the territory of Ukraine,\u201d he said.  Konashenkov said long-range Kalibr cruise missiles struck a command centre in the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing Ukrainian generals and officers, including from the general staff.   Updated at 12.51pm BST    12.14pm    Kyiv has been attacked from the air again, with the sound of air raid alarms and explosions ringing through the Ukrainian capital. \u201cExplosions were heard in Vyshhorod district this morning. Air defence fired at enemy targets,\u201d the military governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said on his Telegram channel on Sunday. He said the shelling had not caused damage or injuries in the city, but asked Kyiv residents to continue taking refuge in shelters. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had hit a tank repair plant in Kharkiv with its Iskander missiles, and destroyed ten howitzers as well as up to 20 military vehicles in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv that had been supplied by Western countries over the past 10 days, Reuters reports.   Updated at 12.52pm BST    11.47am    This from Francis Scarr from BBC Monitoring:       11.37am    The Japanese low-cost airline Zipair Tokyo Inc had said it will ditch its logo featuring the letter Z, a pro-war symbol often seen on Russian military vehicles, to avoid misunderstanding.   The president of the subsidiary of Japan Airlines Co. told a press conference at Narita airport near Tokyo that some people might see the current logo as indicating the company approves of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Mainichi newspaper reported.   \u201cI think some people might feel that way when they see it without any explanation,\u201d Shingo Nishida said.   The new logo will be a geometric pattern in green, black and white, the company said.    Updated at 11.50am BST    11.25am   War in Ukraine could last for years, Nato chief says   The head of Nato has warned that the war in Ukraine could go on \u201cfor years\u201d as president Volodymyr Zelensky vowed Sunday that his forces would not give up the south of the country to Russia after his first visit to the frontline there.  While Ukraine remained defiant, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned Western countries must be ready to offer long-term support to Kyiv.  \u201cWe must be prepared for this to last for years,\u201d Stoltenberg told German daily newspaper Bild.  \u201cWe must not weaken in our support of Ukraine, even if the costs are high - not only in terms of military support but also because of rising energy and food prices.\u201d   Stoltenberg added that he believes a supply of modern weapons would increase Kyiv\u2019s chances to weaken the Russian grip on the Donbas region.  \u201cAlthough the fight in the Donbas is being waged ever more brutally by Russia, Ukrainian soldiers are putting up a brave resistance. With more modern weapons, the likelihood increases that Ukraine will be able to drive Putin\u2019s troops out of the Donbas again as well,\u201d he said.  His comments echo remarks by British prime minister Boris Johnson, who has urged other Western leaders to provide sustained support for Kyiv or risk \u201cthe greatest victory for aggression\u201d since the second world war.  \u201cTime is now the vital factor,\u201d Johnson wrote in an article for the Sunday Times after returning from his second visit to Kyiv, calling for the West to ensure Ukraine has the \u201cstrategic endurance to survive and eventually prevail\u201d.   Updated at 12.22pm BST    11.16am    Tensions between Russia and the west are aggravating talks about the future of one of the United Nations\u2019 biggest and most perilous peacekeeping operations aimed at helping Mali resist a decade-long Islamic extremist insurgency. The UN\u2019s mission, known as Minusma, in the West African nation, where extremist attacks are intensifying, is up for renewal this month, while France and the European Union are ending their own military operations in Mali. Three UN peacekeepers have been killed this month, and Mali\u2019s economy is choking on sanctions imposed by neighbouring countries after its military rulers postponed a promised election. UN Security Council members widely agree the peacekeeping mission, which began in 2013, needs to continue, but a council debate this week was laced with friction over France\u2019s future role in Mali and the presence of Russian military contractors, the Associated Press reports. \u201cThe situation has become very complex for negotiations,\u201d said Rama Yade, senior director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based thinktank.   \u201cThe international context has a role, and Mali is part of the Russian game on the international stage,\u201d she said.  Minusma now counts roughly 12,000 troops, plus about 2,000 police and other officers. More than 270 peacekeepers have died since the mission began. France is leading negotiations on extending the mission\u2019s mandate and is proposing to continue providing French aerial support, which Mali strongly objects to.  Mali asked France, its former colonial ruler, for military help in 2013. The French military was credited with helping to push insurgents out of Timbuktu and other northern centres, but they regrouped elsewhere and began attacking the Malian army and its allies. Patience with the French military presence is waning amid a rising number of extremist attacks, and ties between Mali and Russia have tightened in recent years, in part due to both countries\u2019 animosity towards the West.  There have been a series of anti-French demonstrations in the capital, which some observers suggest have been promoted by the government and a Russian mercenary company, the Wagner Group. The Kremlin denies any connection to the company, but Western analysts say it\u2019s a tool of Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign to gain influence in Africa. The Wagner Group has committed serious human rights and international humanitarian law violations, according to allegations by the EU and human rights organisations.  In Mali, Human Rights Watch has accused Russian fighters and Mali\u2019s army of killing hundreds of mostly civilian men in the town of Moura, while Mali said those killed were \u201cterrorists.\u201d  The UN peacekeeping force and the Malian government is investigating.  Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said in a TV interview in May that the Wagner Group was in Mali \u201con a commercial basis,\u201d and Russian deputy UN ambassador Anna Evstigneeva told the security council that African countries have every right to engage soldiers-for-hire.   Updated at 11.52am BST    10.42am     Ukrainian troops have \u201csuccessfully repulsed\u201d Russian attacks on villages near the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, where bloody battles have been raging for weeks, Kyiv\u2019s armed forces said Sunday. The UN warned this week that remaining civilians in Sievierodonetsk, in the eastern region of Donbas, are running out of clean water, food and sanitation. \u201cOur units repulsed the assault in the area of Toshkivka,\u201d the Ukrainian army said on Facebook. \u201cThe enemy has retreated and is regrouping.\u201d  It said an attack from Russian forces who were \u201cstorming\u201d towards the village of Orikhove had been warded off.  Sievierodonetsk is mostly, but not entirely, under Russian control, according Ukrainian officials, AFP reports. \u201cAll declarations by Russians that they control Sievierodonetsk are lies. Indeed, they control the majority of the city but they do not control it entirely,\u201d local governor Serhiy Haidai said on Telegram Sunday.  He said Russian forces are \u201cconstantly replenishing their army with reserves\u201d. \u201cThey are now using so-called crawling tactics, they are trying to push through step by step, metre by metre,\u201d he added. Authorities continue evacuations from Lysychansk, across a river from Sievierodonetsk and heavily hit by shelling, he said, but evacuations from Sievierodonetsk have not been possible for days, after a last bridge connecting it to Lysychansk was blown up. Ukrainian authorities say hundreds of people are hiding from shelling in the Azot chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, which Haidai said was \u201chit twice\u201d in 24 hours.

While Klympush-Tsintzadze, who is chair of the parliamentary committee on integration of Ukraine to the EU, welcomed EU leaders backing candidate status for Ukraine, she called on the bloc to provide \u201cmajor humanitarian aid\u201d and weaponry. \u201cThat decision ... should not dismiss the other needs of our country,\u201d she said, calling for weaponry. \u201cUnfortunately, we are not getting enough from those particular states.\u201d She pointed to Germany in particular, saying it has \u201cbeen giving smaller weaponry\u201d. \u201cWe understand that that was already a big change in their policy. But so far heavy weaponry does not come really from that country. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake of Germany, trying to kind of postpone those decisions.\u201d Klympush-Tsintzadze added that Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s visit to Kyiv will convince him to provide more aid, now that he and other leaders \u201chave actually seen the ruins and destruction that Russians have have brought on our land near Kyiv with their own eyes\u201d. \u201cMaybe that could change their personal readiness to take the decisions on additional weaponry for us to protect \u2013 because we are protecting ourselves.\u201d  Updated at 11.56am BST    9.47am    Ukraine is losing territories and struggling to regain them since Russia began concentrating its military attacks on the country\u2019s east, Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintzadze has said. Klympush-Tsintzadze told Sky News that she hopes the military situation in eastern Ukraine will change soon. \u201cUnfortunately, at this particular moment, Russia has gathered all this military capacity in the in the east of the country.  \u201cWe are losing some of the territories and and they are staying in this particular moment in the hands of occupiers. We hope there will be a moment and the possibility for us to to get those territories and people back.\u201d The MP thanked allies for providing Ukraine with military aid but said the country requires further assistance. In some areas, Ukraine\u2019s military capability is outnumbered 1-10 by Russia, she said.  Updated at 9.47am BST    9.38am    Allies must provide Ukraine with major humanitarian aid and weaponry, a Ukrainian MP has said. Appearing on Sky News, Ivanna Klympush-Tsintzadze said the situation for Ukrainians is not improving. \u201cThe situation is not getting easier on us and that\u2019s why it\u2019s extremely important that there\u2019s a continuous stream of military aid,\u201d she said. Klympush-Tsintzadze said that the country has no option but to win the war if it is to survive as a state. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many options on the table \u2013 we have to survive,\u201d she said.\u201cIn this war, the aggressor has come to erase us from the map of the world, and we we want to live, build our country and preserve our nation. So therefore we have to win.\u201d  Updated at 9.39am BST    9.16am   Ukraine: Russia trying to make Kharkiv frontline city  Reuters has this line from a Ukrainian official about the situation near Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second largest city:  Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a frontline city,\u201d Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, told Ukraine\u2019s national television.  It comes after Amnesty International this week accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine, saying attacks on Kharkiv - many using banned cluster bombs - had killed hundreds of civilians.  Updated at 11.56am BST    9.02am    The US has transferred 1,400 anti-aircraft Stinger systems and 6,500 Javelin anti-armor systems to Ukraine, the leader of the Ukrainian political party Golos has said. It comes after the US department of defence announced a further $1bn in weapons aid for Ukraine earlier this week.

It\u2019s 10.15am in Kyiv.  Updated at 8.32am BST    8.04am    German chancellor Olaf Scholz says the Group of Seven leading democracies will make clear at their coming summit that Ukraine can expect to receive the support it needs \u201cfor as long as necessary\u201d. In an interview with Germany\u2019s dpa news agency published on Saturday, Scholz said he wanted to use next week\u2019s meeting with fellow G7 leaders in the Bavarian village of Elmau to discuss Ukraine\u2019s long-term prospects. \u201cWe will continue to support Ukraine for as long as necessary,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cWe want to make sure that Russian president [Vladimir Putin\u2019s] calculations do not work out.\u201cPutin obviously hopes that everything will fall into place once he has conquered enough land and the international community will return to business as usual,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is an illusion.\u201d Associated Press reported Scholz as saying he and his counterparts from France, Italy and Romania had discussed further weapons supplies for Ukraine, specifically ammunition and artillery, with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy during their visit to Kyiv on Thursday.The four leaders also backed Ukraine\u2019s bid for membership of the European Union, a stance Scholz said he hoped all of the bloc\u2019s countries would support at a gathering in Brussels next week.  Updated at 8.54am BST    8.00am    Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had visited soldiers on the southern frontline in the Mykolaiv region, about 550km (340 miles) south of Kyiv.\u201cI talked to our defenders \u2013 the military, the police, the national guard,\u201d he said in a video on Telegram on Sunday that appeared to have been recorded on a moving train.\u201cTheir mood is assured: they all do not doubt our victory,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cWe will not give the south to anyone, and all that is ours we will take back.\u201dAnother video showed Zelenskiy in his trademark khaki T-shirt handing out medals and posing for selfies with servicemen.Reuters reported Zelenskiy\u2019s office as saying he had also visited national guard positions in the southern region of Odesa to the west of Mykolaiv. The timing of the trips was not revealed. Zelenskiy has stayed mostly in Kyiv since Russia invaded, although in recent weeks he has made unannounced visits to Kharkiv and two eastern cities near battles.     7.53am    The besieged city of Sievierodonetsk faced heavy artillery and rocket fire again as Russian forces attacked areas around it, the Ukrainian military said. The military\u2019s general staff acknowledged its forces had suffered a setback in the settlement of Metolkine, just south-east of Sievierodonetsk, as the battle for the industrial city in eastern Ukraine continued. \u201cAs a result of artillery fire and an assault, the enemy has partial success in the village of Metolkine, trying to gain a foothold,\u201d it said in a Facebook post late on Saturday.Serhiy Gaidai, the Ukrainian-appointed governor of Luhansk, referred in a separate online post to \u201ctough battles\u201d in Metolkine, Reuters reported.Russia\u2019s Tass news agency, citing a source working for Russian-backed separatists, said many Ukrainian fighters had surrendered in Metolkine.      7.45am   Summary  It is approaching 10am in Kyiv and here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments.  Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine could take years, the Nato secretary general said. Jens Stoltenberg said the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukraine would boost the chance of freeing its eastern region of Donbas from Russian control, Germany\u2019s Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported. \u201cWe must prepare for the fact that it could take years,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cWe must not let up in supporting Ukraine, even if the costs are high, not only for military support, also because of rising energy and food prices.\u201d Russia was sending a large number of reserve troops to Sievierodonetsk from other battle zones to try to gain full control of the besieged eastern city, the governor of Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk region said on Sunday. \u201cToday, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have \u2026 because there are so many of them there already, they\u2019re at critical mass,\u201d Serhiy Gaidai said on national television. Two top commanders of fighters who defended the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have been transferred to Russia for investigation, Russia\u2019s state news agency Tass reported. Citing an unnamed Russian law enforcement source, Tass said late on Saturday that Svyatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of the Azov battalion, and Serhiy Volynsky, the commander of the 36th marine brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces, were moved to Russia. A big explosion rocked an area near Sievierodonetsk on Saturday. Rodion Miroshnik, an official in the self-styled separatist administration of the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, posted a video of what he said was the cloud on the Telegram messaging app. Five civilians were killed on Saturday in Ukrainian strikes on the eastern separatist city of Donetsk, according to local authorities. \u201cAs a result of the bombardment by Ukrainian forces, five people were killed and 12 others were wounded in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d the authorities said in a statement posted on Telegram. Several Russian missiles hit a gasworks in the Izium district in eastern Ukraine, Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov said. \u201cA large-scale fire broke out, rescuers localised the fire,\u201d he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday. Reuters reported him adding that some other buildings had also been damaged. Russian missiles destroyed a fuel storage depot in Novomoskovsk, a town in eastern Ukraine. According to the head of the regional administration on Saturday, three people have been sent to the hospital. The Pentagon is considering sending four additional rocket launchers to Ukraine, Politico reports. According to US defence department officials, speaking to the outlet on condition of anonymity, the US may likely send four more high mobility artillery rocket systems, making their total number about eight. The decision would be \u201cbased on Ukrainian immediate needs\u201d, one official said. Russia and Ukraine have carried out a prisoner exchange, the Kyiv Independent reports. Five captured Ukrainian individuals were returned to Ukraine on 18 June in exchange for five captured Russian individuals, according to the Ukrainian defence ministry\u2019s intelligence directorate. Yuliia Paievska AKA \u201cTaira\u201d, the Ukrainian captured paramedic who was freed from Russian captivity during the week, released a video thanking Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for her release. \u201cI always believed that everything would be exactly this, and everyone who is now on the other side, they know everything will work out,\u201d she said. Zelenskiy presented state awards to border guards in Odesa as he visited troops in southern Ukraine. \u201cI want to thank you from the people of Ukraine, from our state, for the great work you are doing, for your heroic service,\u201d the president said on Saturday. \u201cIt is important that you are alive. As long as you live, there is a strong Ukrainian wall that protects our country.\u201d  Hello, I\u2019m Adam Fulton in Sydney and welcome to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine.

                    "body": "Saturday 30 October, Tottenham versus Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium: Marcus Rashford is a picture of lissome menace, leaving Eric Dier and Emerson Royal in a different postcode as, on 86 minutes, he glides on to Nemanja Matic\u2019s ball and, with zero doubt, beats Hugo Lloris to seal a 3-0 win. This Saturday, Manchester United versus Tottenham, Old Trafford: Rashford does, now, harbour doubt. Will he be selected by Ralf Rangnick? Will he reverse the sputtering form that has yielded four league goals in 18 appearances at 217 minutes each? And will he remain at his boyhood club beyond the summer?  Rashford at a crossroads, debating whether his United career should end. There is a disconnect here, a dislocation. The lad from Wythenshawe\u2019s living of the dream has soured. It was never meant to be this way. In the 18 months after his debut, Rashford won the FA Cup, Europa League and League Cup. He made his England bow, played at Euro 2016 and scored on his senior, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League and international debuts. All before turning 20 after Louis van Gaal first selected him in February 2016. Rashford has the armoury of the prototype elite forward. His is a vibrant cocktail of youth, a slim and powerful 6ft 1in inch frame and afterburner pace. He can dribble, he tries tricks, he is a leader \u2013 on and off the field. And, there is something else \u2013 it seemed. A hunger for, the revelling in, being asked to rise to the occasion, as at Parc des Princes in March 2019. Rewind to then: the score is Paris Saint-Germain 1 United 2, the aggregate 3-2 in the final seconds of a Champions League last-16 second leg. Rashford has already hounded Thilo Kehrer into making the error that leads to Romelu Lukaku\u2019s opener before later seeing the rebound from his shot finished by the Belgian. Now, Rashford is asked to convert a tie-winning penalty after a four-minute wait \u2013 two of these caused by Damir Skomina, the referee, consulting the touchline screen before awarding the kick in a dramatic VAR decision, and two by PSG players trying to distract Rashford. He does not care: the penalty hits the roof of the net. \u201cFearless\u201d is Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s verdict afterwards. But, now, the fear at United is that the 24-year-old may view the future elsewhere. Rashford even considering departing is a black eye for the maligned Glazer ownership. It speaks of the \u00a3494.8m debt-mountain. The zero league titles in nine years. The zero teams who were challengers. The gang of four managers \u2013 David Moyes, Van Gaal, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Solskj\u00e6r \u2013 who have been sacked. Of how United have had as many temporary managers: Rangnick is the fourth (after Ryan Giggs, Solskj\u00e6r and Michael Carrick).  Rashford is United\u2019s ultimate poster boy. A wholesome, socially conscious footballer who has caused Boris Johnson to perform U-turns when campaigning for those in poverty to be fed, holding the prime minister and his government to account. And he is a sponsor\u2019s dream, worth a fortune to United in image rights and copious other commercial spin-offs. A prime factor in the reason Rashford may depart \u2013 a lack of game time \u2013 is his own form: this season he has contributed two league assists to go with the paltry goal return, numbers which form part of a wider pattern. This is Rashford\u2019s seventh campaign for United \u2013 in the previous six, double figures in finishes have been reached only three times, with two of these 10 and 11, in 2018-19 and last year respectively. Only once has there been a count \u2013 17 \u2013 in the bracket consistently returned by the very best: in 2019-20. For a tall man, four headed league goals is underwhelming and shows a glaring gap in his game: one was on his league debut against Arsenal, and there have been none for two years. Caveat time. If Rashford has been dropped by Rangnick for a reason solely his responsibility \u2013 a lack of form \u2013 might there be another reason he is unhappy? That having been at the club since nine, a deep dismay has developed at the endless loop of mediocrity United are caught in? Such that he is pondering whether a short career is being stalled by waiting for an emergence from the doldrums on a tomorrow that may never come.  Which throws up the next question: where could Rashford go? Last summer PSG identified him as a candidate to replace Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 if the latter left for Real Madrid. Yet should the Frenchman depart this close season Rashford is understood to have fallen down this list. Where else? Even if Liverpool were interested it seems incredible United would allow Rashford to go to their fiercest rival and/or he would want to go there for the same reason. Manchester City: doubtful \u2013 Pep Guardiola wants a proven prolific No 9; Rashford is not this. Fifty-eight league goals in 197 appearances (3.39 per strike) is his ratio. Chelsea? For now the club cannot buy anyone. This debate points to how Rashford has not yet developed as it was thought he would. He is still young. But the clock ticks. Mohamed Salah was 23 when he returned to English football two years after Chelsea sold him to Roma. His record at the west London club was moderate: two goals and an assist in 13 league appearances across two seasons. At Liverpool, though, the Egyptian has hit the stratosphere, plundering 32, 22, 19, 22 in his four complete league terms and 19 in this one. Can Rashford do this? First, he has to win back his place. Next, he has to start scoring \u2013 regularly. Then, he has to decide on his future. How it has come to this for Rashford should provoke serious soul-searching: for him and the club he grew up adoring."

Next to the machine was a container of long-life milk. Mzia looked at the small Breville machine and told a senior manager: \u201cThis is not a commercial machine.\u201d It was, according to evidence aired at the disability royal commission, hardly what she needed to provide \u201cbarista training\u201d at the BusyBeans \u201ccoffee school\u201d. The BusyBeans program won awards, was later spruiked by Australia\u2019s national disability insurance scheme as a grants success story, and Mzia said the way it was advertised meant she had been thrilled about the opportunity.  \u201cI was gobsmacked,\u201d she told the inquiry of what she walked into. \u201cI thought it would be a lot more set up.\u201d The royal commission this week examined the disability employment services (Des) program, a $1bn-a-year federal government scheme in which private companies and nonprofits are paid to place people with disability into work. It once again touched on a longstanding criticism of the system: that privatised providers can refer the jobseekers on their books to jobs or training courses run by a related entity. For each placement, the job agency gets an \u201coutcome\u201d payment from the government. They get further payments if the person stays in the job or course, hitting certain weekly benchmarks. The employer, meanwhile, might get wage subsidies from the government to cover the cost of the new workers. And the programs they run \u2013 supported employment or training \u2013 might garner government grants. Yet, according to a recent report commissioned by the government and obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, genuine employment outcomes are underwhelming. The royal commission this week focused on one \u201cregion\u201d of BusyBeans coffee schools, a program established by health services company Rehab Management in March 2019. It heard a related entity, AimBig, was a Des provider that referred jobseekers on its books to the BusyBeans program.  Among them was Mzia, who lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and hadn\u2019t been in a permanent job in 25 years. Under the BusyBeans model, people with disability \u2013 either paid, in part using about government wage subsidies, or unpaid interns \u2013 learned to make coffee with trainers like Mzia. They served as in-house baristas for workers at AimBig and Rehab Management offices or other external businesses or worked in a \u201ccafe environment\u201d. Mzia had lengthy experience in casual hospitality jobs and was adept at making coffee, but she had no formal qualifications. There was no induction or training when she started the job, Mzia told the inquiry. And at her site at least, the inquiry heard, there often weren\u2019t enough people in the office to make coffee for.  This meant the participants \u2013 who were autistic or had moderate intellectual disabilities \u2013 would be \u201cstuck in the office five hours a day, three days a week, just standing in the front of the Breville machine\u201d, the hearing was told. And it heard there were no documents or training manuals to outline how BusyBeans would train participants \u2013 people on the autism spectrum and with \u201cmoderate\u201d intellectual disability. That was until November 2019, when Rehab Management adopted materials Mzia had created herself. Asked why there were no training documents, a AimBig senior manager, Matthew Ting, told the inquiry BusyBeans was intended to be \u201chands on\u201d and \u201cdefinitely not accredited training\u201d. Mzia told the royal commission she found the BusyBeans job herself but was asked to sign a form saying AimBig had found the job for her.  Later, she said she was asked to interview potential BusyBeans participants from AimBig\u2019s caseload of jobseekers. And she alleged she felt pressured into putting them forward even if they were not suitable. The inquiry heard the company did not believe there was a conflict of interest between these roles as employment agency and employer. \u2018An abusive, badly structured system\u2019 Fronting the commission on its third day of hearing on Friday, Marcella Romero, the chief executive of Arriba Group, the holding company for AimBig and Rehab Management, apologised to Mzia. \u201cWe did not live our \u2018people\u2019 value in that instance,\u201d she said. Romero said in a media statement that the program had placed \u201cpeople with a disability into stable ongoing employment\u201d and that she was \u201cproud\u201d of its results. \u201cI acknowledge that BusyBeans program experienced certain challenges in the early stages of the program,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to take the feedback from participants onboard and continue to make improvements to the program, which will include appropriately considering how to implement any recommendations that may emerge from the disability royal commission.\u201d Romero said the company would \u201chope to explore how we may be able to re-establish the program in future\u201d. Despite the free flow of government payments, Ting said the BusyBeans program lost the company money. Romero noted BusyBeans employees were paid \u201creal\u201d wages, unlike so-called \u201csheltered workshops\u201d, known as Australian Disability Enterprises, where people with disability can legally be paid a few dollars an hour. Ting also disputed that workers were generally let go after 26 weeks, a key benchmark that triggers a substantial government payment.  He pointed to one AimBig promotional video showing a \u201ccafe\u201d set-up, which he said showed the program had expanded and improved, compared with the situation at Mzia\u2019s site. Other promotional material available online shows trainees using commercial coffee machines. Despite her complaints, the situation was vastly different at Mzia\u2019s \u201ccoffee school\u201d, the inquiry heard. She told the inquiry that participants would need to carry a bucket of hot water across the office space to a kitchenette because the coffee training area did not have a sink. In October 2019, Mzia was found to need three months of stress leave by her doctor. She briefly returned to work in January, but said she quit in March 2020 after her requests for a position description were not met. \u201cThe uncertainty was impacting my health,\u201d she said. Shortly after, BusyBeans was suspended due to Covid. After only 12 months in operation, the federal government had paid $874,832 in \u201coutcome payments\u201d, more than $111,000 in wage subsidies and a $313,000 grant to establish several \u201ccoffee schools\u201d. By then, there were 167 paid participants and 38 \u201cunpaid work experience\u201d participants. Mzia told the royal commission the experience had left her with a \u201cbroken heart\u201d and a \u201cbroken life\u201d. \u201cI do not want anyone to go through an abusive, badly structured system of Centrelink and \u2026 job providers and these companies that say they are going to support people with disability,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause what you see on the outside, I tell you, is not what\u2019s happening on the inside.\u201d The inquiry continues. Mzia is a pseudonym provided by the royal commission. Do you have a story? luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com"

                    "body": "Frank Lampard believes Everton\u2019s poor away form has created a deep-rooted pessimism that must be overcome for the team to pull clear of relegation trouble. Everton have lost their two Premier League away games under Lampard, at Newcastle and Southampton, although their problems on the road predate the latest manager. The relegation-threatened team have the Premier League\u2019s worst away record \u2013 winning once in 12 matches and collecting six points from a possible 36 \u2013 and visit Tottenham on Monday in desperate need of a result. A more positive mindset will be key to that aim, Lampard insists.  \u201cThe away form is something that won\u2019t necessarily be changed overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are reasons why we\u2019re not getting results. I think some of those are confidence or mentality issues, and when I say mentality it\u2019s not a negative thing, it\u2019s just about how we handle games as a group away from home. Some of them it\u2019s the structure of the team and how we set up, and it\u2019s certainly my responsibility to get that right. But that\u2019s one that we do work on. \u201cHaving said that, if we can get some traction and can get a result, whatever that may be in a positive sense, I think that really helps the change because at the minute there\u2019s a feeling throughout the club of: \u2018We\u2019re going away from home, we may lose this game.\u2019 That\u2019s the first thing we have to broach. If we can broach that with the result then I think we can maybe really start taking that step forward. We don\u2019t want to be a soft touch, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Everton have impressed at home since Lampard replaced Rafael Ben\u00edtez but he admits their previous away performance, a 2-0 defeat at Southampton, was the worst of his brief reign and that lessons must be learned. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play as I want us to play, and the players knew that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a meeting two days after that game to quickly see what went wrong and I think the players understood.  \u201cWhether it would have won or lost us that game, or made a difference, I don\u2019t know, but I know for sure we could have changed our performance levels in that game. The players know. Tactically, there were issues with the team as the game went on that I certainly spoke about afterwards and that\u2019s something that we must improve.\u201d"

                    "body": "  2.57pm   Closing summary  Time for a recap A Bank of England policy maker has warned that UK business investment growth was \u201cstopped in its tracks\u201d by Brexit. Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, said that this created a productivity penalty of \u00a329bn \u2013 or \u00a31,000 per household.  UK businesses began 2023 in a pessimistic mood, according to the latest survey of the economy from BDO. It found that optimism fell last month, as firms experienced a sharp decline in growth as customers cut back. There\u2019s better news from the eurozone, though \u2013 the EC has raised its growth forecasts. It now predicts the European Union will avoid a recession this year, as the fall in gas prices has helped the economy.  Staff at Amazon\u2019s fulfilment centre in Coventry are to walk out on February 28, March 2 and from March 13 to 17, as industrial action at the company intensifies. But a long-running London bus dispute involving drivers employed by Abellio has ended, after workers accepted a pay rise worth 18%. Here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s stories:            2.36pm    As expected, the US stock market has opened a little higher ahead of Tuesday\u2019s inflation report which is expected to show a slowdown in price rises. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 large US companies, has gained 49 points or 0.15% to 33,919 points. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite is 0.2% higher. Shares in Manchester United are up 3.6%, at $24.40, following a Bloomberg report that Qatar investors could make an offer for the English football giant in the coming days.   Updated at 2.38pm GMT    2.15pm   London bus drivers accept 18% pay rise  There\u2019s been a breakthrough in a long-running industrial action in London. Abellio bus workers, largely based in the south and west of London, have accepted a pay offer which will see drivers with over two years\u2019 service being paid \u00a318 an hour. This equates to a pay increase of 18% on the basic rate, the Unite union says. Over 1,800 Abellio workers took more than 20 days of strike action, Unite says, including three days of strike action in late November and strike action in December. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham says:  \u201cThis is an important pay victory. Workers have stood firm and with the support of their union, Unite, they have secured a richly deserved pay increase. Unite\u2019s constant focus on the jobs, pay and conditions of our members is continuing to deliver increased pay awards for workers.\u201d   Updated at 2.24pm GMT    1.49pm    Amazon has insisted that only a \u201ctiny proportion\u201d of its workforce are involved in the strikes announced today. A spokesperson for the e-commerce giant says:  \u201cIn fact, according to the verified figures, only a fraction of 1% of our UK employees voted in the ballot \u2013 and that includes those who voted against industrial action. \u201cWe appreciate the great work our teams do throughout the year and we\u2019re proud to offer competitive pay which starts at a minimum of between \u00a310.50 and \u00a311.45 per hour, depending on location. \u201cThis represents a 29% increase in the minimum hourly wage paid to Amazon employees since 2018. \u201cEmployees are also offered comprehensive benefits that are worth thousands more \u2013 including private medical insurance, life assurance, subsidised meals and an employee discount, to name a few.\u201d      1.37pm    Wall Street is set to open slightly higher, as investors brace for Tuesday\u2019s US inflation report.      1.34pm   Amazon workers announce series of strikes at warehouse in pay dispute  Amazon workers have announced a series of strikes at one of the company\u2019s warehouses in a dispute over pay, PA Media report. The GMB said more than 350 staff at the fulfilment centre in Coventry will walk out on February 28, March 2 and from March 13 to 17.  The union said its members made history last month by becoming the first Amazon workers in the UK to strike in their campaign for a pay rate of \u00a315 an hour. Amanda Gearing, GMB senior organiser, said the \u201cunprecedented\u201d strikes showed the anger among Amazon workers in Coventry. She said:   \u201cThey work for one of the richest companies in the world, yet they have to work round the clock to keep themselves afloat. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening that Amazon workers in Coventry will earn just 8p above the national minimum wage in April 2023. \u201cAmazon bosses can stop this industrial action by doing the right thing and negotiating a proper pay rise with workers.\u201d        1.23pm    The pound has made a decent start to the new week. Sterling has gained almost half a cent against the US dollar, back to $1.21. Against the euro, it\u2019s up a third of a eurocent at \u20ac1.133. The currency could be benefitting from last Friday\u2019s news that Britain has avoided falling into recession. But there are forecasts that the pound could weaken against the euro:    Updated at 1.30pm GMT    1.05pm    Back in the City, shares in UK courier firm DX Group have fallen after it was hit by a legal claim of corporate espionage. The Sunday Times reported yesterday that Sheffield-based logistics firm Tuffnells was alleging that several DX Group employees, who were former employees of Tuffnells, had conspired to obtain daily customer service reports. Tuffnells has lodged its corporate espionage claim in the High Court, claiming that a traffic clerk at a London warehouse was asked to leak confidential corporate information to a rival in exchange for a \u00a350 payment from a delivery driver. Today, DX Group told shareholders that it had received a claim from Tuffnell Parcels Express last Friday afternoon, and that it had investigated the issue last year. DX added:  The Group intends to defend its position robustly and will respond to the claim in due course.  Shares in DX fell by over 10% at one stage today, and are currently down around 6%.     12.50pm    Jonathan Haske\u2019s comments about the impact of Brexit come less than two weeks after the Bank of England said the economic hit from leaving the EU had arrived sooner than thought. As Bloomberg points out:  At its February Monetary Policy Report, Threadneedle Street warned that business investment is \u201cvery subdued\u201d and that the trade hit from Brexit had happened even sooner than it first feared.  And last week, another MPC policymaker \u2013 Catherine Mann \u2013 suggested Brexit had made the UK\u2019s inflation problem worse, as new trade barriers had pushed up costs.     12.14pm    The Office for National Statistics has also reported this morning that UK renters are around three times more likely to face energy and food insecurity than property owners. The ONS recorded that, over the four weeks to December 18, adults who rented their homes were 2.9 times more likely to experience some form of energy insecurity than those who own their own properties. It added that renters were 3.2 times more likely to have suffered food insecurity. The report also indicated older people are less likely to face energy security problems than younger adults, saying:  Adults aged 30 to 64 years had between 1.5 and 1.8 higher odds of experiencing some form of energy insecurity than those aged 65 years and over; while adults aged 16 to 64 years had between 2.0 and 4.6 higher odds of experiencing some form of food insecurity than those aged 65 years and over.   Updated at 12.26pm GMT    11.57am    New figures from the Office for National Statistics have highlighted the shortage of healthcare workers that is hurting the UK economy. In December 2022, across the UK there were more online adverts for healthcare jobs than for other professions, the ONS reports.  Healthcare vacancies were the most common option in 88.8% of local authorities, it adds, while there was higher demand for \u201cinformation and communication technology\u201d professions in the other 11.2% of the country. The ONS says that this increase is part of a longer-term increase in demand.   Despite raised relative demand during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, since 2017 their share of online job adverts has been increasing consistently. The increased share of healthcare profession job adverts, over the last year, was through an increase in the share of adverts for care assistants, nursing, and specialised nurses.   The ONS says it analyed data from jobs site Textkernel. It found that the number of online job adverts had more than halved year-on-year by the end of 2022, as companies cut back on hiring.       11.15am   BoE official says Brexit productivity penalty is \u00a31,000 per household  Back in the UK, a Bank of England policy maker has warned that a wave of business investment was \u201cstopped in its tracks\u201d by the Brexit vote nearly seven years ago. Jonathan Haskel, an external member of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, said an interview with The Overshoot that business investment had \u201cbasically flattened out\u201d after the 2016 referendum. That drop in business investment growth, the Bank has calculated, has created a productivity penalty of about 1.3% of GDP. This is based on what would have happened if investment carried on growing at the pre-referendum rate. Haskel explained to the Overshoot:  That 1.3% of GDP is about \u00a329 billion, or roughly \u00a31000 per household. At the end of the forecast period, the penalty goes up to something like 2.8% of GDP, which is very close to the 3.2% number we found using the totally different reduced form methodology based on goods trade volumes.  This is a timely point, after The Observer reported that a cross-party summit bringing together leading leavers and remainers has been held, to try to address and remedy the failings of Brexit.  This has prompted Lord Frost, the UK\u2019s former chief Brexit negotiator, to urge ministers to \u201cfully and enthusiastically embrace the advantages of Brexit\u201d. Frost claims the meeting is part of a plot to unravel the deal he negotiated.  Haskel, though, insists that the UK\u2019s productivity slowdown \u201cgoes back to Brexit\u201d. Asked why the UK has had a more severe productivity slowdown than other countries since the financial crisis, he says this is partly due to the country\u2019s large financial sector. But, Haskel adds:  If you look in the period up to 2016, it\u2019s true that we had a bigger slowdown in productivity up to 2016, but we had a lot of investment. We had a big boom between 2012-ish to 2016. But then investment just plateaued from 2016, and we dropped to the bottom of G7 countries.  Haskel also suggests that delays in the NHS are responsible for the rise in economic inactivity, as more people leave the labour force. He says:  There are basically two competing hypotheses here in the U.K. One is that actually lots of people have just retired. They were not active before and they\u2019ve decided to give it up and just retire. Um, that\u2019s hypothesis one. Hypothesis two is, is related to ill health. The National Health Service here has had very long waiting lists. It\u2019s proved to be very, very difficult for a very overstretched health service to deal with Covid and deal with the aftermath. We are finding some weak correlations between regional increases in inactivity and regional increases in self-reported ill health within the U.K.  You can read the full interview here: The Bank of England\u2019s Jonathan Haskel on Inflation, Productivity, Brexit, and More  Updated at 11.22am GMT    10.39am    France\u2019s economy is forecast to grow by 0.6% this year, a slowdown on the 2.6% growth racked up in 2022. Today\u2019s EC Winter Forecasts says the easing of inflation pressures will help the French economy:  The French economy is projected to keep gaining traction until the end of 2024 as energy and food inflation moderate, and core inflation progressively declines. This gradual acceleration is expected to be driven by domestic demand, with a mostly preserved household purchasing power over the forecast horizon resulting from government measures, dynamic wages, and a very favourable labour market.   Updated at 11.13am GMT    10.27am    This chart, from the EC\u2019s Winter Forecasts, shows how gas consumption fell last autumn, helping to boost gas storage levels:      10.24am    The EC fears that Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, will contract at the start of this year. The Winter Forecasts say:  Despite a recent improvement in confidence, the [German] economy is expected to suffer another mild decline in early 2023 as energy prices for households are still increasing and government support for January and February will only be disbursed in March. Meanwhile export growth is set to slow down dragged by weak foreign demand.  For 2023 as a whole, Germany\u2019s economy is only expected to grow by 0.2%, one of the weakest performance expected \u2013 but rather better than the 0.6% contraction forecast three months ago. In 2022, today\u2019s report says, Germany\u2019s GDP rose by 1.8%, helped by the reopening of the economy after Covid-19 restrictions. But it shrank by 0.2% in the October-December quarter.     10.14am    Although the outlook for Europe is better than expected, this doesn\u2019t mean it is \u201cpositive\u201d overall, commissioner Paolo Gentolini adds. He points out that today\u2019s new Winter Forecasts still show growth below 1% this year [at 0.8% in the EU and 0.9% in the euro area]. Inflation is still expected to be quite high [6.4% in the EU this year, and 5.6% in the eurozone].     10.09am    Commissioner Paulo Gentolini is now taking questions about today\u2019s winter forecasts. Q: What is the main threat to these forecasts, and what impact will the increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank have? The main risk comes from geopolitical tensions, and the evolution of the Ukraine war, Genolini explains. The EC hopes that developments in the war will have a \u201cpositive influence\u201d on the forecasts, but this is not easy to predict now, Gentolini says. The coming winter could be difficult for energy, he suggests, adding that Europe has already shown in recent months that it can tackle challenges together. It\u2019s possible that measures, such as the common buying of gas, are more effective than expected, he suggests.  The tightening of monetary policy by the European Central Bank will have an impact on the economy, he adds, but will also have a very positive effect by reducing inflation. At the start of February, the ECB raised interest rates by 0.5%, taking its key rate to 2.5%, the highest since 2008.     10.01am    The threat of gas shortages appears less serious than a few months ago, but can still not be dismissed, today\u2019s Winter Forecasts warn. The EC says that the gas crisis has eased, thanks to alternative supply sources being found, the rise in gas storage levels, increased energy efficiency, and the drop in fas prices. But, it warns that geopolitical tensions could drive has prices up again, while China\u2019s reopening could lead to higher demand for gas. That could make it harder to refill gas storage in time for next winter, the report says:  Refilling of gas shortages ahead of the winter of 2023-2024 may therefore pose more challenges than expected in this forecast.      9.54am   Ireland expected to lead recovery with 4.9% growth  Ireland is expected to be the fastest-growing EU member this year, today\u2019s Winter Forecasts show. Ireland\u2019s GDP is forecast to grow by 4.9% in 2023, stronger than the 3.2% forecast in the autumn forecasts three months ago.  Last year, Ireland\u2019s economy is forecast to have grown by 12.2%, a strong performance, and falling inflation should help the economy this year, the EC says. There isn\u2019t, yet, any visible that job cuts in Big Tech have hit Ireland, today\u2019s report says. But, there is uncertainty over how trade will develop, due to the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.     9.41am    Here are the EC\u2019s new forecasts, compared to last autumn\u2019s forecasts three months ago.   Updated at 9.42am GMT    9.31am    Gentolini says the European economy has shown \u201cremarkable resilience to the headwinds unleashed by Russia\u2019s war of aggression in Ukraine\u201d. He tells reporters in Brussels that Europe achieved a \u201cpositive growth surprise\u201d in the second half of last year. The slowdown in the third quarter of 2022 was milder than expected, then the economy stagnated in Q4 rather than contracting by 0.5% as expected. These are \u201cquite outstanding outturns\u201d, Gentolini says, given the pressures on Europe last year. He adds that the estimated 3.5% growth achieved in 2022 is better than the US and China achieved (the UK, though, grew by 4%).     9.24am    Gentolini adds that the risks to the EC\u2019s new economic forecast are \u201cbalanced\u201d. Past risks due to the pandemic and gas shortages have \u201cebbed significantly\u201d, there is still very high uncertainty related to the war in Ukraine, and to geopolitical tensions.     9.20am   EC: Headline inflation has peaked  Headline inflation in Europe has peaked, and is set to decline further, commissioner Paolo Gentolini declares. This is due to \u201crapidly declining energy prices\u201d he says. Inflation in the European Union is now forecast to drop, from 9.2% in 2022 to 6.4% in 2023, and fall again to 2.8% in 2024. [that would still be above the European Central Bank\u2019s target, of 2%, though].  Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.15am   Gentiloni: Europe to narrowly escape technical reecession  Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for Economy, is presenting today\u2019s Winter Forecasts now. He starts with the good news:  The EU economy entered this year on a healthier footing than expected, and looks set to escape recession.  There have been \u201ca number of positive developments\u201d since last autumn, Gentolini says, such as the fall in European gas prices below pre-Ukraine war levels \u2013 due (he says) to demand restraints, diversification of supply sources, and mild weather. Better than previously expected growth at the end of 2022, and improving economic sentiment, indicate the European economy is thus set to \u201cnarrowly escape\u201d the technical recession projected in the autumn, Gentolini says. [A technical recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row]. Eurozone growth in 2022 is forecast to be 3.5%, up from 3.2% forecast before, Gentolini adds.     9.07am    The European Commission\u2019s new winter forecasts warn, though, that Europe faces \u2018strong\u2019 headwinds \u2013 including high inflation and higher interest rates. The EC says:  Consumers and businesses continue to face high energy costs and core inflation (headline inflation excluding energy and unprocessed food) was still rising in January, further eroding households\u2019 purchasing power. As inflationary pressures persist, monetary tightening is set to continue, weighing on business activity and exerting a drag on investment.      9.00am   EC: Europe to avoid recession this year  NEWSFLASH: Europe\u2019s economy is expected to avoid falling into recession this year, the European Commission says, with inflation now forecast to be lower than feared. The EC has just released its new winter forecasts, and has hiked its forecasts for growth in 2023. It no longer expects a recession this year. Instead, forecasts now expect eurozone GDP to rise by 0.9% during 2023, up from the 0.3% predicted three months ago. Announcing the forecasts, the EC says:  Almost one year after Russia launched its war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU economy entered 2023 on a better footing than projected in autumn.  The wider European Union is expected to grow by 0.8% (again, up from 0.3% expected before). The EC says:  Both areas are now set to narrowly avoid the technical recession that was anticipated for the turn of the year. The forecast also slightly lowers the projections for inflation for both 2023 and 2024.  The EC says that \u201cfavourable developments\u201d since its Autumn Forecast was released in November have improved the growth outlook for this year. Crucially, wholesale gas prices have fallen \u201cwell below prewar levels\u201d, it says, with gas storage levels above the seasonal average of past years. Also, the EU labour market has continued to perform strongly, with the unemployment rate remaining at its all-time low of 6.1% until the end of 2022. Confidence is improving and January surveys suggest that economic activity is also set to avoid a contraction in the first quarter of 2023, the Commission adds. The growth rate forecast for 2024 remains unchanged, at 1.5% for the euro area and 1.6% for the EU.  Updated at 11.25am GMT    8.46am    European stock markets have opened slightly higher. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is up 18 points or 0.25% at 7901 points. Energy company Centrica is leading the risers, up 1.6%. Centrica is expected to report a record \u00a33bn annual profit later this week. The smaller FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has inched up by 0.1%, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 has gained 0.26%. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says investors are pondering the continued resilience of the US economy, ahead of new US inflation data due tomorrow. The FTSE100 has benefited from a switch towards defensive companies by investors, Hunter reports.  Such a fallback option has served the UK\u2019s primary index well over the challenges of the last year as investors hunker down in the face of potential recessionary and particularly inflationary pressures. The market\u2019s initial move higher was achieved despite another small raid on the housebuilding sector where rising interest rates, concerns over mortgage availability and affordability and recently cautious comments from some of the leading names have added to the mix. Even so, the FTSE100 remains ahead by 6% so far this year and still one of the favoured global investment destinations.  The more domestically focused FTSE250 was largely flat in early trade, ahead of a week which will see further UK releases on unemployment, inflation and retail sales. If these figures and indeed the outlook can continue to be less disastrous than some had feared, this index could also add to the gain of 6.2% which it has achieved so far this year.\u201d      8.23am   MJ Hudson says auditor resigns over \"lost trust\" in management  Troubled asset management company MJ Hudson has sunk deeper into crisis, with its auditor resigning. MJ Hudson told the City this morning that it learned late on Friday night that its auditor, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, was tendering its resignation with immediate effect. The letter of resignation from EY states that:  \u201cwe are ceasing to hold office because we have lost trust and confidence in the Company\u2019s management and those charged with governance, and in their ability, along with your finance team, to provide us with accurate and reliable information for audit\u201d.  In October, MJ Hudson announced that it was \u201cengaged in discussions with its auditors\u201d regarding significant potential adjustments in relation to its 2022 financial results. Then in December, MJ Hudson suspended its finance boss, warned it would not be able to complete its full-year audit by the end of December. Trading in its shares was suspended then too. Sky News, which broke the news of EY\u2019s resignation last night, says the move is \u201chighly unusual and will underline growing concerns about MJ Hudson\u2019s finances.\u201d      8.11am   UK firms plan biggest pay rises since 2012 to fill staff gaps  Despite the economic squeeze, UK companies are planning to lift wages this year at the fastest rate in a decade. But, pay rises are not expected to match last winter\u2019s double-digit inflation rates. Research from the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development (CIPD) found that 55% of recruiters planned to lift base or variable pay this year as they struggle to hire and retain staff in Britain\u2019s tight labour market. Private sector firms expect, on average, to lift wages by 5% this year, CIPD say, as companies try to attract new staff\u2026. and retain those they already have.  These pay increases could add to inflationary pressures \u2013 something that would concern the Bank of England as it tries to control the cost of living. Around 57% of the firms planning pay rises expect to pay for it through raising prices, rather than lowering profits and absorbing the costs.  The opposite was true 12 months ago, CPID say, suggesting that the tight labour market will increasingly feed through into price rises for organisations\u2019 goods and services. Jon Boys, senior labour market economist at CIPD, says:  \u201cSkills and labour remain scarce in the face of a labour market which continues to be surprisingly buoyant given the economic backdrop of rising inflation and the associated cost-of-living crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s positive to see many employers taking steps to tackle skills shortages by upskilling existing staff and hiring apprentices. However, the UK Government could provide much-needed support by making the Apprenticeship Levy more flexible, to boost employer investment in training and reverse the decline in apprenticeship starts we\u2019ve seen in recent years.      7.52am   UK pub and bar closures jump amid cost of living crisis   There was a surge in pub and bar companies collapsing last year, new figures show. Pub and bar bankruptcies across the UK rose from 280 in 2021 to 512 last year, accountancy group UHY Hacker Young said. That\u2019s the highest total in a decade, as hospitality venues were hit by rising costs due to the energy price crunch, and tepid demand.  Peter Kubik of UHY Hacker Young says the cost of living crisis has made it hard for hospitality firms to keep operating.   \u201cIt\u2019s deeply concerning that so many pubs and bars are closing their doors. In addition to the financial consequences for owners and employees, the loss of a pub can be felt quite keenly by the community. \u201cThis is a particularly difficult period for pub and bar owners, who find they need to spend more and more while earning less and less. Following an extended period of lost revenues during the pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis has been the final nail in the coffin for many. \u201cPerhaps the Government should consider what it can do to alleviate pressures, for instance, by extending the energy bill relief scheme for the hospitality sector.\u201d      7.42am   Introduction: Rising costs and consumer woes hit business optimism  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK may have (narrowly) avoided recession at the end of last year, but businesses remain pessimistic as they cut back on staff as their output falls. The latest Business Trends Report from BDO, the accountancy and business advisory group, has found that optimism stagnated at the start of this year. For the third time in just six months, all four of the Indices tracked by the report - Output, Optimism, Employment and Inflation \u2013 fell simultaneously. The BDO\u2019s poll, which covers over 4,000 companies, found a sharp decline in growth last month. Its BDO\u2019s Output Index which tracks economic growth, fell for the fourth month running. It lost 3.45 points to 89.15, remaining well below the crucial 95-point showing stagnation. The drop in output was driven by falling consumer demand across the services sector, as shoppers cut back. BDO say the cost-of-living crisis \u201cweakened consumer spending and demand across the services sector\u201d. Business optimism remained effectively static, BDO reports. Service sector firms were pessimistic, but optimism among manufacturing businesses rose thanks to waning input price pressures. The economic headwinds buffeting the UK economy pushed BDO\u2019s employment Index down to its lowest point in over a year, as firms cut back on hiring plans.  The outlook \u201cremains bleak\u201d for firms, warns Ed Dwan, partner at BDO:  A net decline across the Optimism, Output and Employment Indices, coupled with historically high levels of inflation, suggests the outlook still remains bleak for businesses, with hiring intentions at their lowest levels in over a year and ever-increasing economic headwinds driving threats of a recession.   Dwan urges chancellor Jeremy Hunt to help businesses in the budget next month.  \u201cWith a new Department for Business and Trade in place and a Spring Budget on the horizon, there is space in Government to consider how best to offer firms a helping hand. Businesses need the right support in place to ensure they can weather the challenges ahead and focus on continuing to drive the growth of the UK\u2019s economy.\u201d   Also coming up today The European Commission is set to publish its regular winter economic forecasts this morning. European finance ministers will discuss the energy market, and the eurozone economy, when they meet for a Eurogroup meeting this afternoon. Europe\u2019s stock markets are set for a calm start, with traders edgy after the US military shot down another flying object on Sunday \u2013 the fourth object to be shot down over North America by a US missile in a little more than a week.  Geopolitical tensions are once again in focus among investors and traders, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade:  The US military shot down a fourth unidentified object yesterday. The concern among traders is that this unidentified object could also be the Chinese spy balloon. Only a few days back, the US military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon, and the second object, which was similar to the first one, was shot on Friday that was flying over Alaska. Republican Mike Turner said that Congress hadn\u2019t received any briefing or report on the unidentified objects, but the American people deserve to know more. The fear here is that things can get out of control and tensions could flare up between the two major superpowers which could adversely influence sentiment among traders. Traders are highly likely to keep close taps on this matter as it continues to develop more.

                    "body": "Tanya Plibersek expressed personal opposition to the stage-three income tax cuts at a public event on Saturday, revealing a view at odds with government policy, a constituent has said. Alex Richardson, a longtime Labor supporter and former party member, claimed the environment and water minister told him \u201cif it were up to me I would get rid of [them]\u201d at the Erskineville public school fair on Saturday. The comments are an apparent contradiction of Labor\u2019s decision not to repeal or restructure the controversial tax cuts, which flatten the marginal tax rate for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000. Before the October budget the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, briefly opened the door to a debate about restructuring the tax cuts while the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, acknowledged \u201cdifferences of opinion\u201d within the government on the question.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  But the government decided not to amend its position, adopted before the May election, and has continued to back the cuts, which will cost an estimated $254bn over 10 years. Legislated shortly after Labor\u2019s bruising 2019 election defeat, the cuts are due to take effect from 1 July 2024, meaning the government still has time to scrap them in the 2023 or 2024 budget. Despite growing momentum in the Labor caucus to revisit its support for the cuts in search of budget savings and to preserve the progressive tax system, Anthony Albanese has firmly insisted Australians expect the party to honour its election pledge.  As recently as 4 October Plibersek noted that Labor \u201cdid go to the last election committing to continue with those\u201d. Richardson told Guardian Australia he approached Plibersek shortly after she delivered a welcome speech at the school on Saturday. Richardson said he urged Plibersek to encourage the government to do more to fight inequality, citing rising corporate profits relative to wages and the need to increase jobseeker payments. He said Plibersek defended the government\u2019s performance, noting Labor had been in power for just four full months after nine years of Coalition rule. Richardson said he praised the tax policies Labor took to the 2019 election \u2013 which included reforms to negative gearing, capital gains tax and franking credits \u2013 when Plibersek was deputy leader to Bill Shorten. Plibersek then said \u201cif it were up to me, I would get rid of the stage-three tax cuts\u201d, according to Richardson, and encouraged him to write to the prime minister with his concerns. The stage-three tax cuts will abolish several tax brackets so that all people earning between $45,000 and $200,000 pay a marginal rate of 30%. But for workers earning less than $96,000, any benefit from the stage-three tax cut is wiped out by the end of the $1,500 low- and middle-income tax offset. The government has come under pressure to restructure the tax cuts, which the Greens note will deliver a tax cut of $9,000 for those earning $200,000 or more. Polling research commissioned by the Australia Institute has found support for the cuts continuing to fall, with 48% now in favour of repealing them, 22% opposed to repealing them, and those who were unsure or didn\u2019t know about the tax cuts down to 30%. On Wednesday Albanese said there was \u201cno change to our policy\u201d on the cuts.  Chalmers told ABC Melbourne he understood \u201cthere are a lot of people who have got a lot of views about those tax cuts\u201d. On budget night, Chalmers said: \u201cWe\u2019re not proposing to change them and we don\u2019t have any proposals to change them. \u201cWe haven\u2019t changed our position.\u201d Plibersek\u2019s office declined to comment when contacted by Guardian Australia."

The payment is designed to help offset some of the huge rise in gas and electricity costs due to take effect the same month and will be paid to those living in properties in council tax bands A-D. About 80% of households qualify for help, but while the money will be paid straight into the bank accounts of those who have a direct debit set up with their local council, anyone paying by any other means will need to make a claim.  The Local Government Association said this meant the payments would take longer as councils would need to first contact the households and then make pre-payment checks before giving the rebate. It said in some parts of the country, thousands of households were not set up to receive the payment automatically.  Hull city council, for example, has estimated that it does not have bank details for 60,000 households, while Dartford council has reported that 15,000 households do not pay by direct debit. Shaun Davies, the chair of the LGA\u2019s resources board, said: \u201cThis year will be tougher than most, particularly for those on lower incomes, so it is good that the government is stepping in to provide financial support to help ease these pressures.\u201d He added: \u201cYou can still get the money if you don\u2019t have a direct debit set up, but it could take longer as your council will have to contact you and then you\u2019ll have to make a claim.\u201d Charities have expressed concern that the way the payments will be distributed means those most in need could miss out. When the policy was first announced, Citizens Advice said it was \u201ca complicated lottery that means support is not targeted at people who really need it\u201d, and called on the government to use the benefits system to deliver the money."

In a filing released on late on Thursday night, the Biden administration said the crown prince\u2019s recent promotion to the role of prime minister meant that he was \u201cthe sitting head of government and, accordingly, immune\u201d from the lawsuit. The immunity decision amounted to a concession to Prince Mohammed, bolstering his standing as the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler after the Biden administration tried for months to isolate him, the Wall Street Journal said.      3.18pm    US crude has also fallen over 4%, on hopes that Opec might decide to turn their production taps up again.      3.11pm   Oil hits 10-month low  Brent crude has now slumped to its lowest since January, down 5% at $83.24 per barrel. The selloff accelerated following the news that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC oil producers are reportedly discussing an output increase. That would keep energy supplies runnning even as the G7 and the European Union try to curb Russian supplies. Such a sharp drop, if it holds, could help ease inflationary pressures \u2013 helping families and businesses this winter.   Updated at 3.50pm GMT    2.50pm   Disney shares surge 8%, adding $14bn to value  Shares in entertainment giant Disney have surged over 8% at the start of New York trading. Disney\u2019s stock has hit $99.47, up from $91.80 on Friday night, as investors welcome the return of former boss Bob Iger as CEO again. That adds around $14bn to Disney\u2019s value, lifting its market capitalisation from $167bn to over $180bn. As covered earlier, traders are hopeful that Iger can set a \u201cstrategic direction for renewed growth\u201d, as Disney\u2019s board pledged as they ousted Bob Chapek after less than three years.  My colleague Jasper Jolly writes:  Disney highlighted a fivefold market value increase under Iger\u2019s previous leadership. The company said Iger had a \u201cmandate from the board to set the strategic direction for renewed growth\u201d, while also looking once more for a long-term successor. Under Iger, Disney made a series of big acquisitions, including the Marvel film franchise, the Pixar animation studio and the Star Wars film franchise.       2.40pm   WSJ: Saudi Arabia eyes OPEC+ production increase  The oil price is falling sharply, on reports that Saudi Arabia is considering whether the Opec+ group should increase crude production. According to the Wall Street Journal, an increase of up to 500,000 barrels per day is being discussed by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC oil producers. Such a move would partly reduce the 2m barrel-per-day cut which Opec and its allies signed off in October, and has sent Brent crude to a near eight-week low.  If the cartel now lifts production, it could help heal a rift with the Biden administration and keep energy flowing Opec members are due to meet on 4th December \u2013 a day before the European Union has said it would impose an embargo on Russian oil, and the Group of Seven wealthy nations\u2019 plans to launch a price cap on Russian crude sales. Here\u2019s the full story: Saudi Arabia Eyes OPEC+ Production Increase Ahead of Embargo, Price Cap on Russian Oil  Brent crude has now shed around 4% to $84.27 per barrel, a drop of over $3 per barrel, the lowest since 27 September.      2.06pm    Just in: Inflation has prompted the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates. Israel\u2019s central bank raised its benchmark rate by half a point, the sixth rise in a row, to 3.25% from 2.75%. Today\u2019s rise came after inflation rose to 5.1% in October, close to a 14-year high.      1.53pm    US economic activity slowed, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity Index fell into negative territory in October, coming in at -0.05, down from 0.17 in September.  That indicates that US growth was below trend.      1.42pm   China and Qatar signs 27-year LNG deal  Important energy news\u2026.China and Qatar have sealed one of the biggest-ever liquified natural gas deals. QatarEnergy has signed a 27-year deal to supply China\u2019s Sinopec with liquefied natural gas (LNG). It\u2019s the longest such LNG agreement so far, according to Reuters, as volatile markets drive buyers to seek long-term deals. It will also put pressure on Europe, points out Bloomberg\u2019s energy reporter Stephen Stapczynski.  Although European countries filled their storage early this year, at a heavy price, the region could struggle next year now, as the Nord Stream pipelines have been sabotaged.     1.33pm    The chair of the John Lewis Partnership has said that consumers are starting to budget and are more conscious of spending, despite being eager to celebrate the first \u201cnormal\u201d Christmas in three years. Speaking at a panel debate at the CBI\u2019s annual conference, Dame Sharon White said there were signs of shoppers changing their habits as a result of cost-of-living pressures. She told the conference:   \u201cThis is the first Christmas for three years that people get to spend with family, friends and loved ones, and I think people will be really excited to have a proper Christmas.\u201cBut you can see all sorts of things going on with consumer spending. \u201cWe have got some customers who are doing their shopping early and have booked their Waitrose delivery slots in advance. \u201cOn the other hand, you can see other customers starting to budget, and shopping is more phased. \u201cPeople are sticking more with own-brand, value ranges, and buying fewer branded products. \u201cCustomers are also shopping a bit less online and are going more into stores in order to enjoy that shopping trip experience.\u201d      1.21pm     The chief executive of Heathrow Airport is not expecting caps on passenger numbers next year \u2013 with airlines more worried about how demand will hold up. John Holland-Kaye, who runs the UK\u2019s busiest airport, says that the darkening economic outlook could  He told reporters at the Airlines 2022 conference today that:  \u201cAirlines are concerned about the nature of demand.\u201d  Heathrow was forced to limit passenger numbers to 100,000 per day this summer, after staff shortages led to long delays, flight cancellations and a lost luggage mountain.  Holland-Kaye is hopeful that such limits won\u2019t be needed in 2023, saying:  \u201cWe\u2019re working on the basis that we\u2019ll have no caps next summer.\u201d      1.04pm    Back on Disney\u2026.Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, has said the reappointment of Bob Iger was \u201cstrange in light of the board\u2019s recent renewal\u201d of Bob Chapek\u2019s contract. Greenfield says Iger will also need to make tough decisions about whether to spin off the ESPN sports television network and buy out Comcast\u2019s stake in the Hulu streaming service. More here.     1.02pm    The pound has dipped back below the $1.18 mark, as investors move into the safety of the US dollar. Sterling hit a three-month high of $1.20 last week, but has been edging lower since as the City anticipates a long UK recession. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, reckons traders are under-estimating how quickly the Bank of England will raise interest rates. He told clients:  \u201cThe labour report last week out of the UK supported our view that the UK recession will be short and shallow. Payrolls continue to increase at a healthy pace even while unemployment numbers are consistent with an economy at or perhaps above full employment, with no hint of job destruction as yet. Inflation soared more than expected in October, to 11.1%, its highest level since 1981. It would have been even higher if not for the government\u2019s Energy Price Guarantee which capped household energy bills.  \u201cThe Fiscal Statement contained aggressive deficit cuts, as expected, but for the most part, they were back loaded and should have little effect in the short and medium term. We think market expectations that the Bank of England can stop hiking rates well short of 5% are fanciful and expect the sterling to outperform as market consensus moves closer to our view.\u201d       12.45pm    City traders will be turning away from their monitors soon to focus on the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, where England are taking on Iran from 1pm UK time. The London market is already subdued, with the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares up 0.1%, and the domestically-focused FTSE 250 index 0.4% higher. Ocado are the top faller, shedding 7.5% as its recent rally unwinds. The online grocer\u2019s shares surged from below \u00a35 at the end of October to over \u00a39 last week, after it signed a deal with South Korea\u2019s Lotte Shopping. But they\u2019re now back at 628p.     12.32pm    England\u2019s stock of office space is falling at the fastest rate for 20 years, new data shows. Office availability is shrinking as employers struggle to fill their desks as employees continue to work from home, with construction of new commercial buildings also slowing. The FT has the story:  Close to 20mn sq ft of workspace was lost to use in the year to the end of March \u2014 just over 2% of the total market \u2014 according to an analysis of business rates data by law firm Boodle Hatfield. That is the biggest annual drop since this data was first collected in 2001. The contraction comes as employers consider how much space they need in the post-pandemic world and accelerates a trend that has seen overall floorspace decline by more than 6% since 2014.    Updated at 3.31pm GMT    12.27pm    In the transport sector, Virgin Atlantic has withdrawn its support for Heathrow\u2019s third runway plans. The change of heart comes amid an ongoing row over the cost of flying from Britain\u2019s biggest airport. The carrier had been one of the most prominent airline backers of expansion before the pandemic. But on Monday its chief executive, Shai Weiss, hit out at Heathrow\u2019s proposal to increase landing charges by 120% and called on the aviation regulator, the CAA, to reform a \u201cbroken\u201d system and \u201cpay closer attention to the abuse of power by a de facto monopolistic airport\u201d. Weiss added:  \u201cUntil that happens, it is difficult to see how expansion at Heathrow can be supported.\u201d       11.45am    The deputy chief of China\u2019s central bank has added to the gloom, warning that the foundations of economic recovery are not yet secure. Reuters reports that:  China\u2019s major economic indicators recovered and stabilised recently but the foundation of the country\u2019s economic recovery is not solid yet, deputy governor of the central bank Xuan Changneng said at the Annual Conference of Financial Street Forum on Monday.      11.37am     Brexit trade problems are being blamed for the closure of a major Grimsby seafood processor. Around 200 jobs are at risk, with Icelandic Seafood International deciding to close the former Five Star Fish facility. Group chief executive Bjarni \u00c1rmannsson explained last Friday that the UK operation is no longer a strategic fit for Iceland Seafood, with the pandemic also disrupting the business.   \u201cIceland Seafood UK invested in operating facilities in Grimsby and merged its operations from Bradford and Grimsby into this location. The investment and decision of the merger was completed in March 2020, just before Covid-19 started, and the renovation and installation of the factory was very much affected by Covid and later Brexit along with difficulties in overall operations. \u201cIceland Seafood has now decided that it plans to exit this market from a value-added perspective and has mandated MAR advisors to support the process.      11.25am    The cost of living squeeze meant the average British household was \u00a3142 worse off in October year-on-year. That\u2019s mainly due to the steep rise in energy costs, supermarket group Asda reports. Asda\u2019s monthly Income Tracker survey, produced with the Centre for Economics and Business Research, shows that the average household had \u00a3203 left over after paying tax and essential bills last month, the lowest amount since August 2018.      11.06am    The return of Bob Iger to the CEO\u2019s chair is \u201cexcellent news\u201d for Disney\u2019s shareholders, says Naeem Aslam chief market analyst at Avatrade.  Bob Iger is back; this is all investors need to know regarding Disney stock. The board has decided it is time to bring him back immediately and let him use his vast experience to help the money in this difficult period. For investors, this is excellent news as they know that Bob Igor not only commands the best skills but also has superior knowledge to shape the company under the current challenging times when everyone is thinking about spending and recession.       10.57am   City watchdog takes aim at gamification of trading  Britain\u2019s markets watchdog has warned operators of stock trading apps to review and potentially change \u201cgame-like\u201d elements which could encourage customers to invest beyond their means. The Financial Conduct Authority is concerned about feaures such as celebratory messages for making trade, points and badges, which could encourage reckless trading. The FCA says:  \u201cConsumers using apps with these kind of features were more likely to invest in products beyond their risk appetite.   Many people were encouraged into trading during the pandemic, when very loose monetary and fiscal policy helped to fuel the stock market boom. They may have lost their appetite already this year, after the heavy losses on markets since January (global stocks are down around 18%).     10.46am   Fears of UK and eurozone recession hit oil  Demand concerns are hitting the oil price today, after a \u201chellish week\u201d for the black stuff last week. So says Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, adding that the looming recession in the UK and Europe will also hit energy demand.  The outlook for global fuel demand continues to deteriorate, with China\u2019s intensifying covid outbreaks and nearly every piece of incoming data pointing to a recession in the Eurozone and United Kingdom. On the supply side, even though OPEC has announced plans to slash production, it was not enough to nullify the prospect of demand destruction. There is also chatter that Europe is overloaded with oil, as refiners ordered as much as possible ahead of the ban on Russian crude that will come into force early next month.      10.41am    As expected (see earlier post) CBI chief Tony Danker is using his speech to press the government to allow more immigration, to help companies grow.   Danker\u2019s plan to revive economic growth is based on more immigration, more trade, and reforming the planning system to make it easier to build. He also urges the UK and EU to get round the table and agree a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol, and warned Brexiteers that the best guarantee of Brexit success is a country that grows. Danker also thanked the conference\u2019s sponsors for continuing to stick with the CBI \u201cdespite Peppa Pig\u201d \u2013 referring to Boris Johnson\u2019s notorious effort last year. Rishi Sunak will speak next \u2013 our Politics Liveblog will be tracking the PM:   Updated at 10.47am GMT    10.23am    Over in Birmingham, CBI director-general Tony Danker is about to open its annual conference \u2013 with a call for a new growth push. We covered the key points earlier in the blog (here and here), and you can watch it online here:      10.15am    Emerging market shares have fallen more than 1% today, on worries that the rise in Covid-19 cases in China will hit economic growth. MSCI\u2019s index of emerging market shares has dropped 1.4%, wiping out a little of its 11% gains during November. Some currencies have also been knocked; China\u2019s yuan is down half a percent, while South Africa\u2019s rand is down 1% and Malaysia\u2019s ringgit fell as much as 0.8%. In another sign that China\u2019s economy may be weakening, the country\u2019s central bank and insurance regulator has asked commercial lenders to step up credit support for the economy today.      9.59am    With its share price close to the lows of the 2020 Covid market crash, it\u2019s no wonder that Disney has parted ways with Bob Chapek as chief executive. So says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell:   \u201cThe real dissatisfaction with Chapek\u2019s performance lies with the decisions made in the aftermath of the pandemic.  \u201cChapek has gone against all the historic values that defined Disney. The company creates \u2018magical experiences\u2019 for individuals and families, be it through cartoons, films or theme parks. In contrast, Chapek has created poor experiences for staff and customers. \u201cHe has riled those working for the company by getting rid of well-respected TV content executive Peter Rice and deciding to move some staff from California to Disney, causing bad morale and a lack of trust.  Customers have had to suffer large price hikes and a big rise in stoppages to rides in its theme parks.   The latest set of quarterly results were the final straw for Chapek. Disney missed expectations for sales and profits, with both the park and media divisions missing estimates. But can returning CEO Bob Iger make enough of a difference? Mould says he should be able to steady the ship, and maybe learn from some of his own mistakes:  \u201cWhen he stood down as CEO in 2020, one of the things Iger regretted was the decision to release so many Star Wars films in a short period, saying that less is more. Perhaps he might now focus on quality of experience, not quantity, and give Disney a tighter focus on getting things right rather than churning anything out. That could apply to the theme park initiatives as well as its media operations.\u201d      9.53am         9.43am   Disney shares surge as Iger returns  Shares in Disney are surging in premarket trading, as investors hail the surprise return of Bob Iger to run the show. They\u2019re on track to open 9% higher, recovering some of the 40% slump during 2022.  My colleague Jasper Jolly has looked into the story, and writes:  Chapek has overseen a difficult period for Disney, with disruption from the pandemic \u2013 which forced its theme parks to close \u2013 followed by concerns over the profitability of its streaming service, Disney+. Disney+ is competing in a crowded field, and has spent billions of dollars to create new content as it tries to beat Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. While Disney\u2019s platform has grown subscriber numbers rapidly, it has come at the cost of steep operating losses in the streaming division. Disney has also faced pressure at its Florida base, after its public opposition to \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d laws that ban classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in certain grades. Disney publicly opposed the laws, seen by many activists and teachers as repressive, prompting the rightwing Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, to try to strip the company of its privileges in the state. The company\u2019s market value has slumped by more than 40% during 2022, much worse than the 17% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index of large US companies.  Here\u2019s the full story:  Adrian Smith, senior director of operations at recruiter Randstad UK, points out that rehiring the old boss doesn\u2019t guarantee success:  \u201cComebacks by leaders are not unknown - the late Steve Jobs\u2019s return to Apple is the most celebrated example. But Jobs was the exception, not the rule. If you rehire people you\u2019ve let go, you\u2019re more likely to be bringing back a Jack Dorsey than a Steve Jobs.\u201d  Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, returned to run the social-media site back in 2015, but only part-time \u2013 which can\u2019t have been ideal for the company to focus through the years dominated by Donald Trump\u2019s tweeting.      9.43am   Oil weakens on China Covid worries and Goldman forecasts  The oil price is weakening this morning, hit by rising Covid-19 cases in China and a downgrade from Goldman Sachs. Brent crude, the oil benchmark, has dropped towards the seven-week low hit on Friday, down $1 at $86.67 per barrel.  Hopes that China might be moving away from its zero-Covid policies have been knocked by the news of first deaths of Covid-19 patients in nearly six months, and a surge in cases. There were 26,824 new infections reported on Sunday, according to the National Health Commission \u2013 the highest daily number since mid-April. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says:  Rising Covid cases and deaths \u2013 the first in months - in China, with the authorities telling millions to stay home, seems to be dampening the mood for risk. Seems to be viewed as pushing back the full reopening and end to zero covid by a notch or several.  Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades, concurs:  Risk appetite is on the downside this morning as investors digested the latest virus development from China where rising Covid deaths are sparking worries of tighter restrictions in the region.   Concerns about China have prompted Goldman Sachs to lower their oil price forecast by $10 to $100 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2022. They also cited the lack of clarity over the Group of Seven nations\u2019 plan to cap Russian oil prices. Goldman economists including Jeffrey Currie wrote that:  \u201cThe market is right to be anxious about forward fundamentals, due to significant Covid cases in China and a lack of clarity on the implementation of the G7\u2032s price cap,\u201d  More lockdowns in China would be equivalent to the deep production cuts imposed by OPEC+ of 2 million barrels a day, they estimated.      9.15am    The euro has weakened this morning, following the surprisingly sharp drop in German producer prices last month (see earlier post). Lower PPI may encourage the European Central Bank to raise interest rates more slowly, but it could also signal a recession.      8.42am   CBI's Danker: Increased immigration would help UK grow  CBI director-general Tony Danker is calling for immigration to \u201cplug the gap\u201d in the economy, to help firms fill job vacancies. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Danker argued that Conservative ministers must recognise that allowing in more workers from overseas will help the economy grow.  \u201cWhen it comes to immigration, it\u2019s quite interesting, when you look at the OBR report on Thursday, they said the only thing that\u2019s really moved the needle on growth is by allowing in a bit more immigration. The reason why it\u2019s so important is we have literally over a million vacancies in this country, we have 600,000 people who are now long-term unwell, who aren\u2019t coming back to the labour market any time soon.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to get this shortage occupation list - the list of people that we\u2019re really missing that we aren\u2019t going to get in Britain any time soon - and we have to get them to plug the gap while we re-calibrate the labour market in the medium term. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s one of those levers that does help you grow, doesn\u2019t cost money, but I recognise it\u2019s a tough political choice for Conservative politicians.\u201d       8.36am    Over in Germany, the prices charged for industrial products have plunged \u2013 in a sign that inflation may finally be peaking. Producer prices fell by 4.2% in October, the first monthly drop since May 2020 during the first Covid-19 lockdowns. Energy prices were the main cause, dropping by 10.4% thanks to a dip in electricity and natural gas costs.  Such a sharp fall raises hopes that inflation is gradually peaking: LBBW economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch says it is:  \u201cPerhaps the first signal of a certain cyclical easing of price pressure.\u201d      8.27am    Our economics editor Larry Elliott wrote yesterday about the absence of a long-term plan from the current government, let alone a vision for the UK:  There are similarities between the current crisis and the state of Britain when Thatcher arrived in Downing Street in 1979: high inflation caused by repeated supply side shocks, and a sense of pessimism that longstanding economic weaknesses will ever be addressed. The model that Thatcher created collapsed in the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and nothing has taken its place. Conservative governments since 2010 have talked about their mission to green the economy and level up, but have promised far more than they have delivered. Only twice since the second world war \u2013 the Clement Attlee-led government in 1945 and Thatcher in 1979 \u2013 has an administration come to power in Britain with a plan for fundamental change and stuck to it. For the rest of the time, the tendency has been to muddle through and hope for the best. Hunt and Sunak appear to be firmly part of that tradition.       8.24am   UK restaurants going bankrupt at faster rate than during Covid   UK restaurants are going bust at a faster rate than during the Covid crisis owing to a \u201ctoxic mix\u201d of surging energy costs, staff shortages and falling bookings. Closures in the sector rose by 60%, with 1,567 insolvencies over 2021-22, up from 984 during 2020-21, according to a study by the advisory firm Mazars. The figure includes 453 over the past three months, up from 395 in the previous quarter. \u201cInsolvencies of restaurant businesses are now happening at a far faster rate than during Covid,\u201d Rebecca Dacre, a partner at Mazars, said.   \u201cIt is a very toxic mix of rising input costs, sharply rising finance costs and weak demand. Most restaurateurs have not seen this combination of negative factors before.\u201d       8.20am         8.18am   Iger 'has track record of success'  The news of Bob Iger\u2019s return to run Disney is equally surprising and unsurprising, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. She pounts out that ousted CEO Bob Chapek has had a tough time navigating the pandemic and the acutely competitive world of streaming.  Clearly Chapek was struggling, given the more than 40% share price plunge this year and the company\u2019s operating losses from streaming surging by $800m to $1.5bn in the third quarter announced this month and clearly Disney is struggling to find an obvious successor. Iger is someone who knows the company probably better than anyone and is well placed to help find the next CEO  Iger nearly left Disney on four occasions, delaying his retirement each time so I am sure he will be pleased to enjoy two more years with the entertainment giant again. He has a track record of success with Disney and may be tasked to make tough cost-centric decisions as a time when the economic downturn is weighing on streaming demand and advertising budgets are getting slashed.\u201d    Updated at 9.53am GMT    8.14am   Bob Iger returns to Disney as Chapek ousted   The big business news of the morning is that Disney has reappointed Bob Iger as its chief executive, and ousted his hand-picked successor Bob Chapek. Iger, who served as Disney chief executive for 15 years, is returning for another two-year stint in the job that made him one of the world\u2019s most successful business leaders. In a statement, Disney said that Iger has \u201ca mandate from the Board to set the strategic direction for renewed growth\u201d. He will also work closely with the board to find a successor. Iger retired from leading Disney in 2020, after delaying his exit several times to guide the company through the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic Disney\u2019s shares have slumped over 40% this year, as investors fretted about the high costs of its streaming business, as many families cut back on such services to save money.  Michael Antonelli, market strategist at financial firm Baird, has compared Iger\u2019s return to Steve Jobs\u2019 highly successful second stint at Apple:        8.04am    The CBI conference takes place against reports that the UK could seek a Swiss-style deal with Brussels, my colleagues Aubrey Allegretti and Lisa O\u2019Carroll write.   Ahead of the prime minister\u2019s address to business leaders in Birmingham on Monday morning, Downing Street tried to dampen down speculation that a deal similar to Theresa May\u2019s \u201cChequers\u201d plan could be adopted, claiming it was \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d. There has been renewed focus on the effects of Brexit given the UK is the only G7 country still lagging behind pre-pandemic growth levels, and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, recently suggested that removing trade barriers would boost growth. Senior government figures were said by the Sunday Times to be revisiting a Brexit trading arrangement offered by the EU last year, which would get rid of 80% of the checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and open up access to the single market. But the move would require the UK to pledge alignment, at least temporarily, on food and agriculture standards. Doing so would be anathema to champions of a hard Brexit, including Boris Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator David Frost, as well as MP       7.58am    Danker will also urge ministers to resolve the festering row over the Northern Ireland protocol, to boost trade. He\u2019ll say:   Right now, our trade as a percentage of GDP is the lowest in the G7.  Boris Johnson achieved a deal with the EU that allows us to continue to trade tariff- and quota-free with our biggest trading partner. There\u2019s some good stuff in there. Currently locked up. \u201cBut still, we argue over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Still, we argue over sovereignty. Get round the table; do the deal; unlock the TCA. I say to Brexiteers, the best guarantor of Brexit is an economy that grows. Its biggest risk is one that doesn\u2019t. \u201cNow I know that some of these things will not be popular with politicians. But while, I have no problem with Government taking tough choices to bring stability, I want them to also take tough choices for growth.  Rishi Sunak promised Joe Biden last week that a deal will be reached with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol \u2013 which regulates trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 will be reached in time of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement next year.      7.55am    Tony Danker is also expected to lay out a three-pronged approach to prod the economy into higher growth. Here are the likely key points: 1) He wants the government to be the \u201cgreat unlocker of private sector investment\u201d.  Many business groups are disappointed that Jeremy Hunt didn\u2019t extend the super-deduction allowance, introduced by Rishi Sunak, which provided 130% relief on purchases of equipment, beyond next April. Danker will argue that Hunt should have maintained this incentive \u2013 rather than simply hitting business with higher taxes, saying:  When Rishi told me he was announcing the super-deduction alongside the increase in corporation tax, the principle was clear. If you choose as a firm to invest less and make a bigger profit today, that is your choice. But you\u2019ll pay more tax. If you choose to invest more in your long-term future, and that of the UK \u2013 you\u2019ll pay less.  \u201cCorporation tax rates will jump 6 points overnight in April \u2013 but now without the incentives \u2013 yet that principle should be staying the same. CBI analysis shows that a permanent full allowances regime alongside that jump \u2013 would unlock an extra \u00a350bn in capital investment per year by the end of the decade. The Government should have taken this path.  He\u2019ll also argue that the government should use its balance sheet to help build industries such as hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel.  2) Government must \u201cchange economic rules\u201d to overcome political barriers. Danker will call for economic migration in areas where firms can\u2019t find people with the right skills, as well as the removal of regulatory barriers holding back growth, and reform of the planning system. 3.) Businesses must show even greater ingenuity.  Danker will argue:  You here in this room. Entrepreneurs, business owners, growing businesses, multinationals. In the past two years you have shown more resilience, imagination, bravery and agility than ever. The bad news is you can\u2019t take a break. Greater business ingenuity has to become the new normal for UK plc.      7.39am   Introduction: CBI to warn Hunt lacks growth plan  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A chill is gripping the economy after chancellor Jeremy Hunt bluntly laid out a future of low growth, high taxation and a record fall in living standards in last week\u2019s autumn statement.  Hunt\u2019s \u00a355bn package of spending cuts and tax rises may have calmed the markets, but it was conspicuously light on measures to boost the economy. And today, Britain\u2019s top business leaders will hear that Hunt\u2019s statement has failed to address the UK\u2019s fundamental growth problem. They\u2019re gathering in Birmingham for the CBI Annual Conference, where CBI director-general Tony Danker will warn that people\u2019s lives will get worse without a push on growth. Danker (who had praised the pro-growth measures in the ill-fated mini-budget) will applaud Hunt\u2019s efforts to get inflation down, but warn that the growth part of the puzzle is missing. He\u2019s expected to say:  The painful reality about growth is that it can\u2019t be stimulated overnight. That\u2019s what the mini budget got wrong. Across the board tax cuts. Immediate demand stimulus. Relying on the old British strength \u2212 consumption \u2212 at the expense of the perennial British weakness \u2212 investment \u2212 has given growth a bad name.   \u201cBut growth is good. Growth is a precondition to a stable society. Without growth the NHS gets worse not better. People\u2019s lives get worse not better. And we lack the resources we need to transform ourselves to a zero-carbon world.   \u201cYet Britain\u2019s had 15 years of low growth and flatlining productivity. We can\u2019t afford a repeat.    The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast last week that the UK has fallen into a recession that will last for over a year, with GDP expected to shrink by 1.4% in 2023.  That\u2019s only half the problem; Danker will also warn that Britain is in the middle of stagflation \u2013 hit with rocketing inflation as well as negative growth. Policymakers can\u2019t just choose to fight one or the other, he\u2019ll argue:  \u201cThe predictable reaction is to choose which \u2018evil\u2019 is worst. But that just leads to different kinds of problem. Ignore inflation to get growth going and we\u2019ve seen what happens. Immediate trauma. Ignore growth to get inflation down? Prolonged pain. I reject the idea that you have to choose. I say you daren\u2019t choose.   The OBR reckons that inflation may be peaking \u2013 but price pressures will remain intense for many months more before finally easing towards the end of next year.  Danker rolled the pitch on Sunday, telling the BBC that Hunt\u2019s statement had been \u201call about fighting inflation and getting the government budget in some decent shape and that does need to be done\u201d. But he added that:   There was really nothing there that tells us the economy is going to avoid another decade of low productivity and low growth\u201d.   Danker will give his speech at 10am, followed by Rishi Sunak. He shouldn\u2019t struggle improve on Boris Johnson\u2019s effort last year, when the then-PM stumbled through his speech, hailed Peppa Pig World, and delivered a grunting impression of an acceleratinng car.  Top economists will give their verdict on the autumn statement to MPs this afternoon.  The Treasury committee will hear from Dr Linda Yueh, Fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford University, Mike Brewer, chief economist of Resolution Foundation, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist of Pantheon Economics, and Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Financial markets are edgy, as investors fret about fresh Covid-19 restrictions in China.  Beijing\u2019s most populous district is urging residents to stay at home today after a rise in caes, with at least one district in Guangzhou being locked down for five days.  The agenda  9am GMT: Jon Cunliffe: Keynote speech on \u2018The Challenges &amp; Opportunities for Policy Makers\u2019 from digital currencies. 10am GMT: Director-general Tony Danker speech to CBI annual conference 10.15am GMT: PM Rishi Sunak to address CBI annual conference 3.15pm GMT: Treasury committee hearing on the autumn statement   "

                    "body": "  7.00pm   Closing summary  It\u2019s 9pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:  The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (\u00a32.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine\u2019s strike range and allow Ukraine\u2019s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. It comes after Italy foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine \u201cwithin seven to eight weeks\u201d. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that \u201cnobody will give away\u201d the eastern \u201cfortress\u201d city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the Ukrainian leader said Ukrainians would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies are \u201cquickened, specifically long range weapons\u201d. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting on Friday to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU\u2019s ban on Russian oil product imports. The EU has promised a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the package would cover trade worth \u20ac10bn and \u201chit the trade and technology that supports [Russia\u2019s] war against Ukraine\u201d. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. President Zelenskiy appealed to the EU to impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders that they had discussed \u201cthe extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere\u201d. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, who he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as President Zelenskiy hosted EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Charles Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set \u201cno rigid timelines\u201d for its accession to the bloc. President Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv\u2019s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. \u201cThere are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach,\u201d von der Leyen told the news conference. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth \u20ac25m, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. De-mining is \u201ccrucial to save the lives of civilian population\u201d, Borrell said. The EU will also supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine\u2019s public buildings. New tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an \u201ciron fist\u201d in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery will be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz B\u0142aszczak. Germany has approved the export of older Leopard 1 battle tanks, which would add to the raft of fighting vehicles Berlin promised last week it would send to Ukraine. A spokesperson said Olaf Scholz\u2019s government had granted an export licence for the German-made tanks first produced in the 1960s and replaced within Germany\u2019s own military by Leopard 2 tanks in 2003. Germany is also understood to be in the process of preparing a joint weapons package with Sweden in which Stockholm would provide air defence missiles and launching platforms for Germany\u2019s Iris-T systems. Robert Habeck, the German deputy chancellor and economic minister, discussed this joint package in a meeting with the Swedish minister for foreign trade, Johan Forssell, during a state visit on Thursday, one government official said. Germany will not play a \u201ckey\u201d role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because \u201cit is American technology\u201d, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was \u201copen to communication with all partners\u201d on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad.   Updated at 7.02pm GMT    6.47pm    Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked Joe Biden for the new US military aid package, which includes a new rocket that will double Ukraine\u2019s strike range for the first time in its war with Russia. The greater Ukraine\u2019s long-range weapons capacity, and the more mobile its troops, the sooner Russia\u2019s brutal aggression will end, Zelenskiy posted to Twitter.   Updated at 6.54pm GMT    6.40pm   France and Italy ready to deliver SAMP/T missile defence system to Ukraine  France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. In a statement after a call between France\u2019s defence minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, and his Italian counterpart, Guido Crosetto, the ministry said:  This will allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russian drones, missiles and plane attacks, through the coverage of a significant part of the Ukrainian territory.  It comes after Italy foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said yesterday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine \u201cwithin seven to eight weeks\u201d. France and Italy agreed to supply their SAMP/T air defence system, known as Mamba, to Ukraine on Kyiv\u2019s request, to help protect the country\u2019s critical infrastructure and cities from the regular barrage of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles.  Updated at 6.47pm GMT    6.32pm   US military package includes rocket-powered bomb to double Ukraine\u2019s strike range  A new US military aid package for Ukraine worth more than $2.175bn includes a new rocket that would double Ukraine\u2019s strike range, according to a US official. The Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) will be provided to Ukraine as part of Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), Brig Gen Patrick Ryder told a news briefing. The GLSDB\u2019s range is 94 miles (151 km), double that of Ukraine\u2019s current longest-range weapon, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), whose rockets can travel 48 miles (77 km). A greater range would allow Ukraine\u2019s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war, attacking Russian forces from a greater distance or potentially penetrating more deeply into Russian-held territory. The GLSDB will put all of Russia\u2019s supply lines in the east of the country within reach, as well as part of Russian-occupied Crimea. It will force Russia to move its supplies farther from the frontlines, which could make its soldiers more vulnerable and complicate plans for any new offensive.   Updated at 6.35pm GMT    6.14pm   New tanks will act as 'iron fist' in Ukrainian counteroffensive, says defence minister  Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said new tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an \u201ciron fist\u201d in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery will be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz B\u0142aszczak. Reznikov said:  The new tank coalition with the main tanks of Nato countries - we need this for the counteroffensive, we will use it like an iron fist to break through their defensive lines.  B\u0142aszczak, who is in Kyiv for talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, said Warsaw was helping to train Ukrainian soldiers to use western tanks and that completing the training was a question of \u201cweeks not days or months\u201d.  Updated at 6.48pm GMT    5.42pm   EU countries agree on Russian oil price cap  EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting today to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats.  The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU\u2019s ban on Russian oil product imports. It follows a $60 per-barrel cap imposed on Russian crude on 5 December.   Updated at 6.00pm GMT    5.32pm   New EU sanctions will hit Russia\u2019s trade and technology, says von der Leyen  The EU\u2019s 10th package of sanctions against Russia will hit the trade and technology that supports its war against Ukraine, according to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.   Updated at 6.48pm GMT    5.19pm   US announces $2.175bn military aid package for Ukraine  The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (\u00a32.2bn). The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Foreign Policy\u2019s Jack Detsch has the full list:   Updated at 5.25pm GMT    4.56pm   Summary of the day so far  It\u2019s nearly 7pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:  Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that \u201cnobody will give away\u201d the eastern \u201cfortress\u201d city.

Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea have said they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, said the nationalised properties included banks and tourist and sport infrastructure. Norwegian police say they intend to continue to interrogate a former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner group who sought asylum in Norway after fighting in Ukraine. Andrey Medvedev has handed \u201csome digital material\u201d to police, Norway\u2019s national criminal police service, Kripos, said in a statement. He remains a witness and is not under any obligation to talk to investigators, it added. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine has decided not to immediately boycott the Paris 2024 Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete. Instead, it will consult with and persuade sports officials around the world to take action over the next two months. The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, Tony Estanguet, has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year.  Hello everyone. It\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email.      4.20pm   Zelenskiy appeals for EU sanctions on Russian nuclear  Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the European Union to impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom and its top managers. Ukraine\u2019s president was speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, who lead the European Commission and European Council respectively. The EU has promised a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders they had discussed \u201cthe extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere\u201d. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, who he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children.  We would like some of the states, European states who still don\u2019t want to impose sanctions against Rosatom, the top managers of Rosatom\u2026 the nuclear power for them to understand what if their children were just taken, put into buses and forcefully taken to the Russian Federation. For this forced deportation you need to enforce sanctions.  The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block. Russia has provided Hungary with a \u20ac10bn loan to expand a nuclear power plant with Russian nuclear reactors. Last week the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said extending sanctions to nuclear power \u201cobviously needs to be vetoed\u201d. All EU sanctions must be passed unanimously by the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, von der Leyen said the EU\u2019s 10th package of sanctions would cover trade worth \u20ac10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components. The package will also include measures to counter circumvention of sanctions, she said.     4.08pm   Ukraine\u2019s future is with the EU, says Michel  The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has tweeted a clip of his recent joint press conference with Ukraine\u2019s President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The Ukrainian people have made \u201ca clear choice for freedom, democracy, and rule of law\u201d, Michel said.  He continues:  We in the EU have also made a clear decision. Your future is with us in our common European Union. Your destiny is our destiny.    At the joint press conference in Kyiv, von der Leyen said there were goals for Ukraine to meet as part of its EU membership push. Asked about Ukraine\u2019s accession drive, she said:  There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach.      3.53pm         3.16pm   Zelenskiy: Ukraine will fight to hold on to 'fortress' Bakhmut  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that \u201cnobody will give away\u201d the eastern \u201cfortress\u201d city. Speaking at a news conference with top European Union officials, Zelenskiy said:  Nobody will give away Bakhmut. We will fight for as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress.  Ukraine would be able to hold Bakhmut and liberate occupied Donbas \u201cif it received long-range weapons\u201d, Zelenskiy added. He said:   If weapons (supplies) are quickened, specifically long range weapons, we not only will not leave Bakhmut, but we will also begin to deoccupy Donbas, which has been occupied since 2014.  The city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region has become the focal point of Ukrainian resistance and of intense efforts by Moscow to regain battlefield momentum. Russian officials have said its forces are encircling Bakhmut from several directions and battling to take control of a road which is also an important supply route for Ukrainian forces. Zelenskiy said Russia would continue to push in the east, but that Ukrainian forces would be able to hold out until more western weapons arrived.  Updated at 4.09pm GMT    2.40pm    Air raid sirens have sounded in Kyiv, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports.   Updated at 2.40pm GMT    2.38pm    Here are some of the most recent images sent over the news wires from Kherson in Ukraine.     Updated at 2.41pm GMT    2.31pm    Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that at least one person has been killed by shelling in Donetsk. It posted to its official Telegram channel:  Russian troops shelled the centre of Toretsk in Donetsk region: one person was killed, six were injured. Kurakhivka was also shelled from artillery, three people were injured, the Donetsk regional prosecutor\u2019s office reported.  The claims have not been independently verified.  Updated at 2.42pm GMT    2.29pm    Traders are using Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia to evade EU sanctions on Russia, a tactic that breaches these countries\u2019 compliance with the bloc\u2019s embargo, Latvia\u2019s prime minister said on Friday. Krisjanis Karins made the assertion after talks with counterparts from the EU member states Estonia and Lithuania, which along with Latvia have been among the most vocal supporters of sanctions on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. \u201cIt seems quite clear that traders are finding ways to legally trade goods, say with Turkey, Kazakhstan or Armenia, which are then re-sent to Russia, because these countries are not adhering to the sanctions regime,\u201d Reuters says Karins told reporters in Talinn, the Estonian capital.  Updated at 2.46pm GMT    2.13pm    Back with the Olympics for a moment, the Associated Press is reporting that the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine has decided not to immediately boycott the Paris 2024 Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, but instead at its extraordinary general assembly held today, it approved plans to consult with and persuade sports officials around the world to take action over the next two months. The committee members voted for \u201cconsultations on preventing the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in all international competitions and a possible boycott\u201d. Ukraine boycotted some sporting events last year rather than compete against Russians. The last multinational boycott of an Olympics was in 1998, when North Korea were joined by Cuba, Ethiopia and Nicaragua in boycotting the Seoul Olympics in South Korea.  Updated at 2.26pm GMT    1.46pm    The first task is to wipe off or cover up the Z, says Anatoly, 44, of the call sign infamously daubed on Russian hardware involved in the war in Ukraine. \u201cWe don\u2019t want friendly fire later on.\u201d Then the mechanics get to work. In a secret location in Ukraine, within a vast warehouse that could be mistaken for a tank graveyard, what was once Russian \u2013 Soviet, in many cases \u2013 is being turned Ukrainian.  All the headlines have recently been made by the decision of Germany and a host of others to supply Ukraine with western heavy armour: Leopard 2s, Challengers and Abrams. The names have become familiar and they may have the technical cutting-edge and firepower to turn the course of the Ukraine war, when they arrive and if in sufficient numbers. But for all the efforts of the Nato allies, it is Russia that is unwittingly, and yet by some margin, Ukraine\u2019s biggest donor of tanks today. Oryx, the open-source Dutch intelligence defence analysis website, has collected photographs of 546 captured Russian tanks. It will be just a fraction of the total haul of tanks that were either abandoned by the fleeing Russian forces or seized in bloody battle. Read the full story here:   Updated at 2.11pm GMT    1.39pm    The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has said it is for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year. Tony Estanguet told Reuters he was \u201cin favour of maintaining this symbol of universality for the Games\u201d when asked about Russian and Belarusian participation. The decision rested with the Games\u2019 governing body, he added. Estanguet said:  It\u2019s not in the charge of Paris 2024 to decide who is allowed to participate, it\u2019s about the IOC, it\u2019s about the IPC, it\u2019s about the international federations who will decide which delegations will be allowed to participate.  Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the IOC to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the 2024 Paris Games. Allowing them to take part would be tantamount to showing that \u201cterror is somehow acceptable\u201d, Zelenskiy has said. On Thursday, sports ministers from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland called on international sports bodies to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in the Olympics and other events while the war in Ukraine continues. Poland\u2019s sport and tourism minister, Kamil Bortniczuk, told Reuters he believed it would be possible to build a coalition of about 40 countries, including the US, Britain and Canada, supporting the call to block Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympics.  Updated at 1.48pm GMT    1.29pm    Here\u2019s some more detail on the news that Ukraine has unveiled a criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said in a statement that his office has served \u201ca notice of suspicion to the head of the private military company \u2018Wagner\u2019\u201d, without identifying Prigozhin by name. He added:  The head of this group is directly responsible for thousands of war crimes. He openly admits his role in the war against Ukraine and, with the Kremlin\u2019s permission, resolves staff issues by recruiting tens of thousands of prisoners.  Under Ukraine\u2019s criminal code, suspects in criminal cases must be informed in a \u201cnotice of suspicion\u201d. Kostin listed accusations against Wagner, including encroachment on Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and waging an aggressive war. He added that Wagner fighters of all ranks would be held responsible, including those who fled abroad. He added:  I am certain together with international partners we will ensure comprehensive responsibility both for every criminal who came to our land with weapons in his hands and also for their patrons who do business in blood.   Updated at 1.32pm GMT    1.14pm   Germany will not play key role in transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, says Kuleba  Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Germany will not play a \u201ckey\u201d role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because \u201cit is American technology\u201d. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, ruled out sending fighter jets to Ukraine earlier this week, saying his focus was on the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said his country \u201creally needs\u201d planes and long-range missiles \u201cto destroy the military infrastructure of the Russian occupying forces\u201d in occupied territories of Ukraine. He said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was \u201copen to communication with all partners\u201d on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales. Asked about Scholz\u2019s role, Kuleba said the issue of jets \u201cis far from Germany\u201d. He said:  Why was the position of Germany and Chancellor Scholz important regarding Leopard tanks? It is a [mass-produced] tank, but it is German technology, so Germany\u2019s word was key. In the issue of aircraft, Germany\u2019s word is not key, because it is American technology.     Updated at 1.31pm GMT    12.44pm    Among the blizzard of announcements aimed at showing the EU\u2019s support for Kyiv, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe is \u201cbringing light to Ukraine\u201d. Von der Leyen has confirmed the EU will supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine\u2019s public buildings.  Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d to Von der Leyen.   Updated at 1.31pm GMT    12.25pm   EU to launch humanitarian de-mining programme  The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth \u20ac25m, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. De-mining is \u201ccrucial to save the lives of civilian population\u201d, Borrell wrote on social media.  Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, announced the programme after meeting with Borrell in Kyiv yesterday, posting to Telegram that it was an \u201cimportant component of our recovery, which will allow us to return normal life\u201d.  Updated at 1.11pm GMT    12.10pm    Norway has confirmed it will order 54 new German-made Leopard 2 tanks for its army from the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann Group, with an option to buy a further 18 tanks at a later time. Speaking at a news conference, the Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said:  We ensure that we have the same tanks as our Nordic neighbours and many key Nato allies.  This \u201cfurther strengthens our relationship with Germany\u201d, he added. Norway, which shares a 196km (122-mile) Arctic border with Russia, had planned to either order German-made Leopard 2 A7 tanks or the Korean-produced K2 Black Panther.  Updated at 12.31pm GMT    11.57am    Norwegian police say they intend to continue to interrogate a former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner group who sought asylum in Norway after fighting in Ukraine. Andrey Medvedev, who had previously told the Guardian he feared for his life and that he had witnessed the summary killing of Wagner fighters, has handed \u201csome digital material\u201d to police, Norway\u2019s national criminal police service, Kripos, said in a statement. The material was being examined, it added. Medvedev remains a witness and is not under any obligation to talk to investigators, Kripos said, adding that he \u201cgives the impression that he wants to continue to say more\u201d about his time with Wagner.  Medvedev is the first known soldier from the Wagner group who fought in Ukraine to flee abroad. Security arrangements have also been made for Medvedev\u2019s safety, \u201cboth visible and non-visible\u201d measures, Kripos added.  Updated at 12.13pm GMT    11.47am    European Council president Charles Michel is in Kyiv, along with the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and 15 European commissioners to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for what they describe as a summit meeting. The highly symbolic visit is the first EU political mission of its kind to a country at war, and comes as the bloc prepares to adopt a 10th package of sanctions against Russia. \u201cThere will be no let-up in our resolve,\u201d Michel tweeted as he arrived in the Ukrainian capital. He added:  We will also support you every step of the way on your journey to the EU.    Updated at 12.12pm GMT    11.34am   Germany approves Leopard 1 tank deliveries to Ukraine  Germany has approved a delivery of Leopard 1 main battle tanks to Ukraine from industrial stocks, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit has said. Hebestreit confirmed \u201can export licence has been issued\u201d for the delivery by a private arms-marker of its older Leopard 1 tanks, but did not provide further details. S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung had reported that the German government approved German arms maker Rheinmetall\u2019s plans to sell 88 of the older Leopards to Ukraine for a total cost of more than \u20ac100m. Deliveries of the older Leopard 1 tanks from the industrial stocks could be made as soon as the tanks are repaired, the paper writes. However, there are still problems in obtaining the required 105-millimetre ammunition, it writes.  It comes after the German government announced it would send 14 Leopard 2 main battle tanks from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine. Berlin is also considering buying back 15 Gepard tanks it had sold to Qatar, the German newspaper reported. It said several German officials had discussed with Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry the possible purchase of Gepard tanks that Doha had bought to secure the World Cup stadiums. The paper quoted Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, as saying:  The Gepards have proven themselves very well in the war in Ukraine. If we could get more from partners here, that would definitely help the Ukrainians.  Hello everyone. It\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email.  Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.06am   Summary of the day so far \u2026   Top EU officials are due to meet on Friday in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, as well as 15 European commissioners, traveled to the Ukrainian capital for \u2018a summit meeting\u2019. Von der Leyen is on her fourth visit to Kyiv since Russia\u2019s invasion. EU leaders will seek to cool Ukraine\u2019s expectations of a fast track to membership, while avoiding negative public statements that could weaken morale and damage Zelenskiy\u2019s efforts to project a European future for Ukrainians. Western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv\u2019s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. Zelenskiy called on Thursday for more punitive measures against Russia by the EU, but sanctions being prepared by the bloc for the anniversary will fall short of his government\u2019s demands. \u201cWe see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,\u201d Zelenskiy told a joint news conference. \u201cThe terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.\u201d Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, responded to the Ukrainian president\u2019s comments on Friday, saying: \u201cWestern Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet.\u201d The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will \u201cstand by Ukraine for the long haul\u201d. Von der Leyen also reiterated that the EU would cap the price of Russian petroleum products, as part of a broader G7 plan to restrict oil revenues available to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. The prosecutor general\u2019s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine. There are reports that one person has been killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia region. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine\u2019s mayor of the city, claimed the victim was a former Ukrainian policeman who had defected to help the authorities in the area of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has this morning said the war will continue in Ukraine as Donbas is not \u201cfully protected yet\u201d. Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. Nato called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty, it said in a statement on Friday. Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei group, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday.  That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours.  Updated at 11.16am GMT    10.37am    The Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has this morning said the war will continue in Ukraine as Donbas is not \u2018fully protected yet\u2019. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass quotes him as saying:  Donbas is not fully protected yet, so a special military operation continues. Actually, we must protect the people who live there until this goal is fully achieved. This remains to be done.  Peskov went on to say that \u201cthe security of Crimea is ensured reliably\u201d. Russia claimed to annex the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014 in a move not widely recognised by the international community.  Updated at 11.11am GMT    10.19am    The air alert that has been in force across Ukraine for nearly the last two hours has ended, the state broadcaster Suspilne reports.  Updated at 10.57am GMT    10.17am    Nato called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Start nuclear reductions treaty, it said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe note with concern that Russia has failed to comply with legally binding obligations, including on inspection, and call on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty,\u201d Reuters reports Nato\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a tweet.  Updated at 10.57am GMT    9.53am    The main event in Kyiv today is that top European Union officials are due to meet Friday in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, as well as 15 European commissioners, traveled to the Ukrainian capital for what they described as a summit meeting. Von der Leyen is on her fourth visit to Kyiv since Russia\u2019s invasion. Susie Blann at Associated Press writes that the last such summit was held in Kyiv in October 2021 \u2014 a few months before Russia\u2019s latest incursion into Ukraine. Since then, assistance for Ukraine from the EU has reached almost \u20ac50bn (\u00a344.6bn / $55bn) since the fighting started. The EU is providing Ukraine with financial and humanitarian aid and plans to adopt a 10th package of sanctions again Russia in the coming weeks \u2013 the pace of which has been criticised by Zelenskiy. Ukraine wants to join the 27-nation bloc on an accelarated timescale, though it could take years. In the meantime, von der Leyen said Thursday that the European Commission is willing to let Kyiv join what she called some \u201ckey European programs\u201d that will bring benefits similar to membership. Those programs were due to be discussed in Friday\u2019s meeting, which will also address one of the main obstacles to Ukraine\u2019s EU membership: accusations of endemic corruption.      9.29am    Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei Group, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday, citing anonymous sources. Reuters reports the Nordic Nato member, which shares a 196 km (122 miles) Arctic border with Russia, had planned to choose either German-made Leopard 2 A7 tanks or the rival Korean-produced K2 Black Panther.     9.09am    Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said on Friday that they had nationalised around 500 properties in the peninsula including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures. In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, said that the decree targeted \u201caccomplices of the Kyiv regime\u201d and that the nationalised properties included banks and tourist and sport infrastructure. Reuters reports that according to a document published on a Crimean government website, properties belonging to former Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and businessmen Igor Kolomoisky, Rinat Akhmetov and Serhiy Taruta were among those confiscated. Crimea, which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, has been controlled by Moscow since 2014, when Russia unilaterally annexed the peninsula.     8.33am   Ukraine presses criminal charges against Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin  The prosecutor general\u2019s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. The Ukrinform website reports that the statement was published in the Uriadovyi Kuryer government gazette. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine (Article 110 part 3 of the criminal code of Ukraine) and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine (Article 437 [art 2). In a grim video released over new year, Prigozhin \u2013 a long-term ally of Putin \u2013 was filmed visiting a basement near the eastern front in Ukraine filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city of Bakhmut, a key Russian objective.  Updated at 8.40am GMT    8.18am    There are reports that one person has been killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia region. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is quoting Vladimir Rogov, leader of the pro-Russian We are together with Russia movement in occupied Ukraine. He reported on Telegram: \u201cIt\u2019s loud in Enerhodar. The cause of the explosion that sounded this morning in the city was a car explosion. According to preliminary data, one person died as a result of the terrorist attack. The fire has now been extinguished. Pyrotechnic teams are checking for the presence of explosives to prevent another explosion.\u201d Enerhodar is the city adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Dmitri Orlov, Ukraine\u2019s mayor of the city, also posted to Telegram about the incident. He reported that the victim was a former Ukrainian policeman who had defected to work for the occupying Russian authorities. Zaporizhzhia is one of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. In his message, Orlov implied that the policemen had been targeted because of criminal and corrupt activities among the occupiers, writing:  Since the beginning of March last year and until now, Enerhodar has been a city where the occupiers have been active in criminal activities: they torture and capture people, rob the city\u2019s residents and entire businesses. But they put in their pockets a part of what they receive from the Russian Federation to provide for their needs. Living Rashists do not need \u2026 witnesses. Therefore, they will continue to carry out similar \u201ccleanings\u201d. And the first one has already left.  None of the claims by either Rogov or Orlov have been independently verified.  Updated at 8.24am GMT    7.53am    Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, has posted to Telegram, responding to the Ukrainian president\u2019s comments about the slowing down of western sanctions on Russia. She quotes the media saying \u201cZelenskiy complained that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down, and Russia has become faster to adapt to restrictions\u201d and goes on to write:  Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet.      7.50am    Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne offers this summary of the last 24 hours in its latest bulletin on Telegram. It writes:  At night, the Russian military attacked the Barvinkove community in the Kharkiv region. A private house was destroyed and a 70-year-old man was rescued from the rubble. Two men died. Also at night, the Russian army shelled Kherson. They hit one of the shopping centres, a fire started there. People were not injured. Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region also came under fire. There are no dead or injured. Over the past 24 hours, one person was killed by Russian shelling in Donetsk region, and eight others were injured. In the Kherson region, two people were killed in a day, nine more were injured, among them a five-year-old child.  The claims have not been independently verified.  Updated at 7.54am GMT    7.27am    Here are two images sent over the news wires from Kramatorsk, showing search and rescue operations taking place yesterday. Three people died, eight people were hospitalised with injuries, including two who are in a serious condition, after a building was struck by a Russian missile.    Updated at 7.49am GMT    7.11am    Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reports the latest status update from Ukraine\u2019s regional authority in partially occupied Kherson, one of the areas the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Suspilne posted to its official Telegram channel:  During the day of 2 February, the Russian occupiers shelled Kherson oblast 65 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, mortars, and tanks. Kherson \u2013 13 times. They targeted a shipbuilding plant, a school and residential buildings. Two people died, nine were injured. Among the injured was a five-year-old boy.   Updated at 7.47am GMT    6.53am   EU leaders to dampen Ukraine\u2019s hopes of fast-track EU membership  EU leaders will seek to cool Ukraine\u2019s expectations of a fast track to membership at a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday, as the bloc spars over how much encouragement to give its war-torn neighbour. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, are due to meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday for wide-ranging talks on the war, further sanctions on Russia and integrating Ukraine into the EU\u2019s internal market. It is understood that the EU leaders will seek in private to temper Ukraine\u2019s expectations of a fast-tracked membership, while avoiding negative public statements that could weaken morale and damage Zelenskiy\u2019s efforts to project a European future for Ukrainians. Western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv\u2019s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. Earlier this week, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, told Politico his country had \u201ca very ambitious plan to join the European Union within the next two years\u201d.   Updated at 7.38am GMT    6.40am    For this Friday\u2019s must-read: Guardian correspondents have looked into how Putin\u2019s plans to blackmail Europe over gas supply failed:  The worst-case scenarios piled up over the summer months. Germany\u2019s economic minister warned of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d industrial shutdowns, fraying supply chains and mass unemployment. France\u2019s president urged citizens to turn down the heating. Spain asked why countries that hadn\u2019t got hooked on Russian gas should bail out neighbours who had lectured them about fiscal discipline in the past. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, gleefully predicted that Europeans would be \u201cfreezing in their homes\u201d because they hadn\u2019t thought through the consequences of throwing their support behind Ukraine. \u201cThe cold is coming soon,\u201d he said, menacingly, in June last year. But as the European Union enters the last month of the meteorological winter in 2023, signs are becoming clearer that its members have weathered a historic crisis \u2013 and not just because \u201cGeneral Frost\u201d has proved a milder adversary than Medvedev predicted. Within eight months of Russian troops setting foot on Ukrainian soil, the bloc of 27 European states replaced about 80% of the natural gas it used to draw through pipelines with Russia, by rapidly building up new infrastructure for liquid natural gas, finding creative ways to help each other out amid shortages, and successfully pursuing energy-saving policies.  Read the full story at the link below:   Updated at 7.36am GMT    6.22am    The US Central Intelligence Agency director, William Burns, said on Thursday that the Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitions toward Taiwan should not be underestimated, despite him likely being sobered by the performance of Russia\u2019s military in Ukraine. Burns said the United States knew \u201cas a matter of intelligence\u201d that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of self-governed Taiwan by 2027. \u201cNow, that does not mean that he\u2019s decided to conduct an invasion in 2027, or any other year, but it\u2019s a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,\u201d Burns told an event at Georgetown University in Washington. \u201cOur assessment at CIA is that I wouldn\u2019t underestimate President Xi\u2019s ambitions with regard to Taiwan,\u201d he said, adding that the Chinese leader was likely \u201csurprised and unsettled\u201d and trying to draw lessons by the \u201cvery poor performance\u201d of the Russian military and its weapons systems in Ukraine.  Updated at 7.34am GMT    6.03am    Ukraine\u2019s allies are pushing the International Monetary Fund to finalise plans for a multibillion-dollar lending programme, the Financial Times reported on Friday. IMF representatives are planning to meet Ukrainian officials in mid-February to advance discussions over a loan that could range from $14bn to $16bn, the report said, citing officials familiar with the talks.     5.48am   Zelenskiy pushes for 10th sanctions package from EU leaders meeting in Kyiv  European Union leaders will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv today, bringing the promise of new sanctions against Russia but likely dashing Ukraine\u2019s hope for swift EU membership, Reuters reports. The head of the group\u2019s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Kyiv by train on Thursday, a symbolic journey to demonstrate support for Ukraine as the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s 24 February 2022 invasion approaches. Senior members of the EU\u2019s executive met their counterparts in the Ukrainian government, and von der Leyen and the chairman of the 27 EU national leaders, Charles Michel, will convene talks with Zelenskiy on Friday. Zelenskiy called for more punitive measures against Russia by the EU, but new sanctions the bloc is preparing for the anniversary will fall short of his government\u2019s demands. \u201cWe see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,\u201d Zelensky told a joint news conference alongside European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cThe terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.\u201d \u201cRussia is paying a heavy price, as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation,\u201d Von der Leyen said on Thursday. \u201cBy 24 February, exactly one year since the invasion started, we aim to have the 10th package of sanctions in place.\u201d  Updated at 7.26am GMT    5.35am   Welcome and summary  Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Our top story this morning: European Union leaders will meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday, bringing the promise of new sanctions against Russia but likely dashing Ukraine and its president\u2019s hopes of swift EU membership. \u201cRussia is paying a heavy price, as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday. \u201cBy 24 February, exactly one year since the invasion started, we aim to have the 10th package of sanctions in place.\u201d Here are the other key recent developments \u2013 including what has happened so far at the talks between EU leaders and Zelenskiy:  The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing it will \u201cstand by Ukraine for the long haul\u201d. Speaking at the start of a two-day trip to Kyiv, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated that the EU aimed to have a 10th package of sanctions against Russia in place by 24 February. Von der Leyen also reiterated that the EU would cap the price of Russian petroleum products, as part of a broader G7 plan to restrict oil revenues available to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. The G7 and the EU have already agreed on a price cap on crude oil that came into force last December and, according to Von der Leyen, costs Russia \u20ac160m (\u00a3143m/$174m) a day. The EU\u2019s 27 member states are yet to agree on the latest oil price cap. The EU also intended to work with Ukrainian prosecutors to set up an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine to be located in The Hague, Von der Leyen said. The purpose of this centre was to collect and store evidence for any future trial, whether that took place via a special tribunal or some other way. The European parliament has voted in support of a roadmap for Ukraine\u2019s accession to the EU. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has said he wanted Ukraine to join the EU in two years, but in reality it was likely to take much longer. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the EU to impose more sanctions on Russia, and said he had discussed a new sanctions package with Von der Leyen. Zelenskiy said the speed of the EU sanctions campaign against Russia had \u201cslightly slowed down\u201d while Russia had been \u201cincreasing its pace of adapting to sanctions\u201d. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said sending fighter jets to Ukraine would require \u201cmonths if not years\u201d of training and that he was looking for the most effective way of helping Kyiv secure victory. Russia is planning a major offensive to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, according to Ukraine\u2019s defence minister. Speaking to French media, Oleksii Reznikov said Russia would call on a large contingent of mobilised troops. Referring to the general mobilisation of 300,000 conscripted soldiers in September, he claimed that numbers at the border suggest the true size could be closer to 500,000. Russia has warned it has \u201cthe potential\u201d to respond to western arms deliveries to Ukraine that will not just be about \u201cusing armoured vehicles\u201d. In a speech marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory against Nazi Germany in the Battle of Stalingrad, Vladimir Putin appeared to allude to Russia\u2019s enormous nuclear weapons arsenal, warning that \u201cthose who expect to win on the battlefield apparently do not understand that a modern war with Russia will be utterly different for them\u201d. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia\u2019s arms suppliers will \u201csignificantly\u201d increase their deliveries of military hardware during this year. Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s powerful security council and oversees a government commission on arms production, said new supplies would help Russia inflict a \u201ccrushing defeat\u201d over Ukraine on the battlefield. Two Russian missiles struck Kramatorsk on Thursday, after an apartment block in the eastern Ukrainian city was hit on Wednesday night, killing at least killing three people and injuring 20. The latest strikes resulted in civilian casualties, said the head of the regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, but it was not clear how many. In addition, two people were killed by Russian shelling in the southern Kherson region. At least eight people died after a fire at a dormitory for construction workers in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, Russian officials said. The fire broke out in temporary accommodation for workers building the Tavrida highway, a road linking the cities of Sevastopol and Simferopol, according to the Russia-installed governor of Sevastopol. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said everybody wanted the conflict in Ukraine to end, but that the west\u2019s support for Kyiv was playing an important role in how Moscow approached the campaign. In an interview on Russia\u2019s state TV, Lavrov also said Moscow had plans to overshadow pro-Ukrainian events arranged by western and allied countries around the world to mark the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A senior Russian lieutenant who fled after serving in Ukraine has described how his country\u2019s troops tortured prisoners of war and threatened some with rape. \u201cI have personally seen our troops torture Ukrainian soldiers,\u201d Konstantin Yefremov, who is the most senior soldier to speak out against the war, told the Guardian in a phone call. \u201cI feel relieved that I can finally speak out about the things I have seen.\u201d A state-of-the-art missile defence system provided by Italy and France should be up and running in Ukraine within the next two months, Italy\u2019s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. France and Italy agreed to supply their SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine, on Kyiv\u2019s request, to help protect the country\u2019s critical infrastructure and cities from the regular barrage of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said he is open to supplying Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets if the decision is taken together with Nato allies. In an interview with Bild, he stressed that his assessment was \u201cbased on what Nato countries decide together\u201d and that the decision required the \u201cstrategic consideration of the whole\u201d alliance.

Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children.\nThe Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv province as a \u201clie\u201d.\nUkraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region \u2013 one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s key war aims.\nUkraine\u2019s first lady Olena Zelenska said it was a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to be present at the Queen\u2019s state funeral, \u201con behalf of all Ukrainians\u201d.\nDenis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia.\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, a study finds.\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said.\nThe Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said during a visit to China.\nGermany\u2019s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit\u2019s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations.\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies.\nThe German central bank said it was increasingly likely that Europe\u2019s largest economy would shrink for a \u201cprolonged\u201d period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent.\nGermany\u2019s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition.\nThirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city\u2019s Russian-backed mayor said.\nRussian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine\u2019s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine\u2019s state nuclear company Energoatom said.\nThe Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv province as a \u201clie\u201d.\nRussia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine men\u2019s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed.\nThe US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a \u201cconsequential\u201d response from the US.\nRussia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to around 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the UK\u2019s ministry of defence said.\nRussia was one of a small group of countries excluded from the Queen\u2019s state funeral in London today that included Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin is \u201cincreasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,\u201d in its latest update on the Russian campaign.\nOn Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia\u2019s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country.\nUkrainian military said on Sunday its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports.\nFive civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region, while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday.\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia.\nUkrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia\u2019s invasion.\nThe Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday.\nThe Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the \u201cdeath of our boys for illusory goals\u201d.\nThe Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, has criticised Russia after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week.\nThe Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n 7.06pm  \n\nDenis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia.Reuters reports that in a video posted on social media, he told Luhansk People\u2019s Republic leader Leonid Pasechnik in a phone call that \u201cour actions should be synchronised\u201d.\n\n\n\n 6.53pm  \n\n\nGermany\u2019s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition.\nLambrecht said the 10 howitzers already supplied by Germany and eight from the Netherlands \u201chave proven themselves in battle.\u201d\nShe said:\n\nUkraine is full of praise of the system and has expressed a desire for more howitzers. \nIn order to further support Ukraine in its brave fight against the brutal Russian attack, Germany will grant this request.\u201d\n\nLambrecht said the Panzerhaubitze 2000 model howitzers recently underwent refurbishment.\n\n\n\n 6.22pm  \nRussia no longer has full control of Luhansk region after Ukraine captures village\n\nUkraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s key war aims.\nLuhansk\u2019s governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukraine\u2019s armed forces were in \u201ccomplete control\u201d of Bilohorivka. \u201cIt\u2019s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cStep by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.\u201d\nVideo footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces have occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two-and-a-half months. After a long and grinding battle Ukraine\u2019s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk.\nOver the past 12 days Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region, and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border.\nThere were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital Kyiv.\nOver the weekend Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the river\u2019s left bank.\nUkrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove.\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counter-offensive, the thinktank said.\nGovernor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People\u2019s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people learning about Moscow\u2019s military setbacks, he claimed.\nOn Monday, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility.\n\nYou can read the full report here.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.20am BST\n\n\n 6.18pm  \n\nMore on the mass grave in Izium.\nReuters reports that Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday.\nOleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said around 450 bodies are believed to have been buried at the site in a forest on the outskirts of Izium, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region.\n\n\n\n 5.16pm  \n\nA hearing in Moscow to decide on the future of the Jewish Agency\u2019s activities in Russia has been postponed for four weeks after lawyers for the charity, which facilitates immigration of Jewish people to Israel, asked for time to submit amendments to the agency\u2019s scope of operations.\nRussia\u2019s justice ministry first recommended in June that the Jewish Agency - a quasi-governmental body - be shut down for violating Russian privacy laws. A hearing in August was delayed by the Basmanny city court to 19 September, and delayed again today for another four weeks.\nIsrael has been caught in a delicate balancing act since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February: the country relies on Moscow to facilitate its military operations next-door in Syria, but has also faced pressure from its western allies to impose sanctions and forceful diplomatic action.\nIsrael\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, has warned that closing the Jewish Agency\u2019s offices would be a severe blow to bilateral relations.\nAbout 24,000 Russians have arrived in Israel since the start of the war, and another 35,000 are waiting for paperwork to be processed, according to the Jewish Agency.\nAround 165,000 people with Jewish heritage were estimated to live in Russia at the beginning of 2022.\n\n\n\n 5.13pm  \n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and how expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions.\nRussia and Ukraine together export about 28% of the world\u2019s wheat supply.\nResearchers in the United States and Uruguay modelled the likely impact of the conflict on wheat and maize prices over the coming 12 months, looking at a variety of scenarios for the study published in Nature Food.\nOne model found that if Russian grain exports were halved and Ukrainian exports significantly reduced during that time, maize would be 4.6% more expensive and wheat 7.2% more expensive - even assuming that other exporters could step in and plug the gap.\nThe researchers said the price increase would persist as long as exports remained restricted, Agence France-Press reports.\nTo close the supply shortfall, the study found that other major producers would need to expand their grain-growing areas significantly.\nWere all grain exports from Ukraine to cease, Australia would need to expand its wheat area by 1%, China by 1.5%, the European Union by 1.9% and India by 1.2%, according to the model.\nThis land-use change would lead to just over a billion tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent added to the atmosphere, the study said.\nLead author Jerome Dumortier, a researcher at the O\u2019Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs in Indianapolis in the US, said:\n\nThe cropland expansion resulting from the war in Ukraine is occurring at the expense of more carbon emissions,\u201d said United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned in July that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had combined with the lingering trade impacts of Covid-19 to create an \u201cunprecedented global hunger crisis\u201d.\n\nFigures from the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization show food prices are currently more than 10% higher than they were a year ago.\nAlthough Moscow and Kyiv reached an agreement in July to resume some grain exports, there are fears that the conflict could lead to years of elevated food prices.\nDumortier said that it was not currently clear whether other grain producers were able to meet global demand, meaning prices could rise even further than predicted in the models.\n\u201cThere are drought conditions in South America, Europe, and China, and export restrictions from various countries,\u201d he told AFP.\n\u201cGiven those hindrances to full adjustment, commodity prices may be higher than what is estimated in the paper.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 5.01pm  \n\nUkraine\u2019s first lady said it was a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to be present at the Queen\u2019s state funeral, \u201con behalf of all Ukrainians\u201d.\nOlena Zelenska, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s wife, was among hundreds of heads of state and dignitaries from around the world gathered in Westminster Abbey for the service on Monday.\nShe represented her nation at the ceremony on behalf of her husband, as he continues to organise the fightback against Russian invaders, PA News reports.\nZelenska said the Queen\u2019s attention to Ukraine \u201cwas an important signal of support\u201d.\nShe wrote on Twitter:\n\nShe wished us better times and shared our desire for freedom. We will always remember it with deep gratitude.\u201d\n\n\nOn Sunday, Zelenska visited Westminster Hall for the Queen\u2019s lying in state to pay her respects to the Queen.\nShe was pictured bowing her head as she stood alongside Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal and Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko.\nEarlier she met the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace.\nZelenska travelled to the UK after her husband last week signed a book of condolence for the Queen.\n\nThe UK\u2019s ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons, said she was \u201cdeeply honoured\u201d by the president\u2019s gesture.\nShe added:\n\nGrateful to the president for taking the time to do this given all else that is happening in (Ukraine) at this time.\u201d\n\nUkrainian troops have been taking part in a major counter-offensive against Russia\u2019s forces.\nZelenskiy appeared to be a fan of the Queen, having been given a biography of the Queen by Boris Johnson during the then-prime minister\u2019s visit to Kyiv in June.\n\n\n\n 4.25pm  \n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said on Monday.\nReuters reports that the ministry said an unknown person threw a Molotov cocktail on to the grounds of the Russian embassy in Ottawa.\nThe ministry also said \u201caggressive\u201d demonstrators had blocked an entrance to the consular section of the embassy.\n\nUpdated at 4.28pm BST\n\n\n 4.14pm  \n\nHere is a summary of events so far: \n\nThe Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China.\nGermany\u2019s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing

be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia.\nIn an intelligence update, Britain\u2019s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified.\nUkrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia\u2019s invasion.\nThe Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday.\nThe Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\nThe Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the \u201cdeath of our boys for illusory goals\u201d.\nThe Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week.\nThe Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n 4.11pm  \n\nA selection of recent pictures from the agencies\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.29pm BST\n\n\n 4.07pm  \n\nMy colleagues Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report on the Ukrainian recapture of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region, with liberated Ukrainians telling of life under occupation.\n\nUntil last week, a portrait of Vladimir Putin hung on the wall of the mayor\u2019s office in the town of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region.\nThere was a Russian flag. Around a cabinet table, a pro-Kremlin \u201cleader\u201d, Andrey Strezhko, held meetings with colleagues. There was a lot to discuss. One topic: a referendum on joining Russia. Another: a new autumn curriculum for Shevchenkove\u2019s two schools, minus anything Ukrainian.\n\n\n\nStrezhko\u2019s ambitious plans were never realised. On 8 September, Ukraine\u2019s armed forces launched a surprise counteroffensive. They swiftly recaptured a swathe of territory in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, including Shevchenkove. Most residents greeted the soldiers with hugs and kisses. Strezhko disappeared. He is believed to have fled across the Russian border, along with other collaborators.\nShevchenkove\u2019s acting military administrator, Andrii Konashavych, pointed to the chair where the pseudo-mayor had sat in the council building. On the wall was a portrait of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine\u2019s national poet who gives his name to the town. What happened to the Putin photo? \u201cWe tore it up,\u201d Konashavych said. Why was there no picture of President Zelenskiy? \u201cPresidents come and go. Shevchenko is eternal,\u201d he replied.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\n\n\n 3.49pm  \n\n\nThe Kremlin said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China.\nNikolai Patrushev, secretary of the national security council chaired by Russian president Vladimir Putin, described the \u201cstrengthening of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation with Beijing as an unconditional priority of Russia\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d\nDuring a meeting with Guo Shengkun, a top official of China\u2019s Communist party, Patrushev said:\n\nIn the current conditions, our countries must show even greater readiness for mutual support and development of cooperation.\u201d\n\nAfter the talks in the Chinese city of Nanping, Patrushev\u2019s office said in a statement that the parties agreed to:\n\n\u2026expand information exchanges on countering extremism and foreign attempts to undermine the constitutional order of both countries in order to derail independent policies of Russia and China serving their national interests.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese and Russian officials also emphasized a need to expand cooperation on cybersecurity and bolster contacts between their law enforcement agencies on fighting terrorism.\nThe statement didn\u2019t offer any further details of prospective cooperation.\nPutin met with Chinese president Xi Jinping last week in Uzbekistan, their first encounter since the Russian leader invaded Ukraine in February.\nA Chinese government statement issued after the meeting said Xi promised \u201cstrong support\u201d for Russia\u2019s \u201ccore interests.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \n\nGermany\u2019s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit\u2019s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week.\nThe German Left party\u2019s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats.\nShould three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships.\nParty insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of \u201claunching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier\u201d.\nRead the full report here.\n\n\n\n 2.10pm  \n\n\nThe Associated Press has a preview of this week\u2019s meeting of the UN general assembly:\n\nFacing a complex set of challenges that try humanity as never before, world leaders convene at the United Nations this week under the shadow of Europe\u2019s first major war since World War II \u2014 a conflict that has unleashed a global food crisis and divided major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War.\nThe many facets of the Ukraine war are expected to dominate the annual meeting, which convenes as many countries and peoples confront growing inequality, an escalating climate crisis, the threat of multiple famines and an internet-fuelled tide of misinformation and hate speech \u2014 all atop a coronavirus pandemic that is halfway through its third year.\nFor the first time since the United Nations was founded atop the ashes of World War II, European nations are witnessing war in their midst waged by nuclear-armed neighbouring Russia. \nIts invasion not only threatens Ukraine\u2018s survival as an independent democratic nation but has leaders in many countries worrying about trying to preserve regional and international peace and prevent a wider war.\nThe UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the strategic divides \u2014 with the west on one side and Russia and increasingly China on the other \u2014 are \u201cparalysing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face\u201d.\nHe pointed not only to the devastation in Ukraine from nearly seven months of fighting but to the war\u2019s impact on the global economy.\nEscalating food and energy prices are hitting the world\u2019s poorest people hardest, and nations are \u201cbeing devoured by the acids of nationalism and self-interest\u201d instead of working together and resolving disputes peacefully, two principles that lie at the heart of the UN charter and underpin everything the United Nations tries to do.\n\n\n\n\n 1.58pm  \n\n\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies.\nScholz, whose two-day trip will also take him to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will become the latest Western leader to meet with the crown prince.\nBin Salman has been regarded as a pariah in the West due to his suspected role in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\nBut he is being courted again as Europe and its allies urgently seek fresh sources of fossil fuels after Russia cut gas supplies amid soaring tensions over its invasion of Ukraine.\nAgence France-Press reports: \n\nScholz, accompanied by a business delegation, will visit Saudi Arabia on Saturday, where he will meet with the crown prince and - if his health permits it - King Salman, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said.\nHe did not go into detail about the reasons for Scholz\u2019s Gulf visit but said he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if the topic of energy was not discussed.\nThe spokesman also offered assurances that \u201cthe murder of Mr Khashoggi will certainly figure in discussions\u201d.\nIt is the latest sign of bin Salman\u2019s international rehabilitation - in July, French President Emmanuel Macron held talks with him in Paris, and US President Joe Biden visited the kingdom.\nOn Sunday, Scholz will head to the UAE and meet with President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and in the afternoon will hold talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.\nGerman economy minister Robert Habeck already visited Qatar and the UAE in March in an effort to find alternatives to Russian gas, which Germany has traditionally depended on heavily.\nRussia\u2019s decision to cut off supplies has triggered an energy crisis in Europe, with consumers and businesses facing soaring bills as winter approaches.\n\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\nRussian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have sentenced an employee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - the world\u2019s largest regional security organisation - to 13 years in jail on treason charges, Russian news agencies reported Monday.\n\u201cA panel of judges found Dmitry Pavlovich Shabanov guilty \u2026 and sentenced him to 13 years in prison,\u201d the RIA Novosti news agency reported, quoting the supreme court of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR).\nShabanov, who was detained in April, is accused of passing confidential information to foreign intelligence services, Agence France-Presse reports.\nAccording to separatist authorities, Shabanov was recruited in 2016 by a former officer of Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service and an agent in Ukraine of the US Central Intelligence Agency.\nBetween August 2021 and April 2022, he collected \u201cinformation on the movements of military equipment as well as units of the Lugansk People\u2019s Army\u201d and \u201csent them to the CIA agent\u201d, the separatists said.\nThe OSCE has \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned the charges against Shabanov and Mikhail Petrov, another OSCE staffer detailed in April, describing the allegations as \u201ctotally unacceptable so-called \u2018legal proceedings\u2019\u201d.\nThe OSCE mission,

Others showed signs of having suffered violence.\nLast week, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced the discovery of a mass grave in Izium after it was recaptured from the Russians.\nAt one burial site, more than 440 graves dating between March and September 2022 were discovered.\nInvestigators have exhumed the bodies of at least 17 Ukrainian soldiers from one site. A cross over the grave bore the inscription: \u201cUkrainian army, 17 people. Izium morgue.\u201d\nThe authorities say there are more than 440 tombs because the last number entered on the crosses is 445. Some of the crosses are made from varnished wood and also carry names and dates.\nInvestigators say about 100 bodies have been exhumed.\nUkrainian officials suspect that some of the dead were tortured by Russian forces during their occupation of the north-east Kharkiv region.\nAt least two of the bodies recovered were found with their hands tied, AFP journalists said. One of the two \u201chad their hands tied, their jaw broken and two stab wounds in the back\u201d, a member of the Kharkiv prosecutor\u2019s office told AFP on condition of anonymity.\nThe remains have been identified as that of a pro-Ukrainian volunteer fighter, the official added.\nCivilians who died during fighting in March for control of the city have also been exhumed.\nAround 10 teams \u2013 each of around four people, including representatives of the prosecutor\u2019s office \u2013 have been at work investigating following the discovery of the graves.\nEmergency service workers in white overalls were handling the exhumations.\nKharkiv prosecutor Yevgen Sokolov, who is leading the investigation, said he did not have an exact number for those thought to have suffered violent deaths. Of the bodies so far exhumed, he said \u201cmost have wounds from shelling and explosions\u201d.\nOthers had suffered \u201cinjuries from sharp objects and showed signs of violent death\u201d, he said. Sokolov said one combatant had had \u201chis hands tied behind his back\u201d and another was found with \u201crope around the neck and broken limbs\u201d. He also said a body was exhumed \u201cwith multiple stab wounds\u201d.\n\u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t have bodies with bullets in their skulls but there is still a lot of work to be done,\u201d he said.\nIf the weather remained mild, he estimated it would take another week to finish exhuming the bodies.\n\nUpdated at 3.07pm BST\n\n\n 1.04pm  \n\nEurope\u2019s imports of thermal coal in 2022 could be the highest in at least four years and may rise further next year, analysts said on Monday, highlighting the extent of the energy crisis following sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports.\nEuropean imports of thermal coal this year could rise to about 100m tonnes, the most since 2017, according to Noble Resources International Pte Ltd, while commodities pricing agency Argus expects shipments to reach a four-year high.\n\u201cEurope is going back in time,\u201d Rodrigo Echeverri, head of research at Noble, told a conference.\n\nUpdated at 1.15pm BST\n\n\n 12.40pm  \n\nEuropean governments have outlined new measures on how they will cope with potential energy shortages this winter, with Russian gas flows still running at severely reduced rates amid the Ukraine war.\nReuters reports that Spain has drawn up plans that could force energy-intensive industries to shut at peak demand times.\nFrance said it was preparing to send gas to Germany from October, while Berlin said Europe\u2019s powerhouse was still in talks on state aid for ailing utility Uniper.\nRussia, which had supplied about 40% of the European Union\u2019s gas before its February invasion of Ukraine, has said it closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline \u2013 once one of Europe\u2019s major gas supply routes \u2013 because western sanctions hindered operations.\nEuropean gas prices have more than doubled from the start of the year amid a decline in Russian supplies.\nThe sharp drop in Russian fuel exports has left governments scrambling to find energy resources, but also to warn that power cuts could happen, amid fears of recession.\nIn France, exports of natural gas to Germany could start around 10 October, the head of France\u2019s CRE energy regulator said, following an announcement by president Emmanuel Macron that the two EU neighbours would help each other with electricity and gas flows amid the crisis.\nCRE chief Emmanuelle Wargon told FranceInfo radio:\n\nGas was (until now) only flowing from Germany to France, so we did not have the technical tools to reverse the flows and we did not even have a method to regulate prices.\u201d\n\nWargon added that \u201cexceptional\u201d measures this winter could include localised electricity cuts if the winter is cold and EDF\u2019s plans to repair corrosion-hit nuclear reactors are delayed.\n\u201cBut there will be no gas cuts for households.

Firefighters at 27 airports across Australia have called off a strike that threatened to ground all domestic and international passenger flights for several hours next week.

The 15-year-old was \u201cpinned underwater\u201d after her foot became stuck in wooden debris, Fire and Rescue NSW said. \u201cThe teen was in imminent danger of drowning, her face was bobbing in and out of the water,\u201d FRNSW captain Amon Burkill said.  If not for the quick actions of those firefighters entering the river, I\u2019m in no doubt it would have ended tragically.  A multi-agency rescue operation was launched just before midday after reports three children, including the 15-year-old, were in difficulty in the Hunter River, at the town of Denman. Rescuers were able to find and rescue two children who had clambered onto a log. The 15-year-old was found another 300 metres downstream, with her foot trapped in timber debris. \u201cShe was pinned underwater, struggling to breathe,\u201d FRNSW said in a statement. After quickly forming a plan to free the girl from the river, a firefighter entered the water and was able to untangle her foot from the debris. A second FRNSW rescuer fitted her with a flotation harness. The three children were later taken to safety by an SES team. The girl has since been taken to hospital for assessment.  Updated at 7.16am GMT    6.58am    New senator David Pocock on lobbying over IR bill Earlier this afternoon, independent ACT senator David Pocock was on ABC\u2019s afternoon briefing, where he was asked a pretty interesting question about lobbying. Pocock was asked if he had any \u201ceye opening\u201d moments during the process behind the IR bill, from both major parties, as well as \u201cexternal players\u201d such as business lobby groups or unions. Here is what Pocock had to say:  The whole lobbying thing has been eye-opening over the last six months but it reached a whole other level in the IR [bill]. I\u2019m committed to consulting. It is useful having access to experts, people representing workers, unions on the one side and small businesses and big business peaks. I\u2019ve spoken to them all and kept trying to come back to the policy and then consulted widely here in the ACT with small businesses, with people who live here, workers \u2013 and in the end the government was willing to give up a lot more ground than I thought they would. We\u2019ve landed in a place that I believe reflects what people of the ACT would want me to vote on. I\u2019m loving being able to talk to people from all sides of the political spectrum, working with in the Senate, and then with both sides of politics. I had some really constructive conversations. I made it clear, I\u2019m not here to rubber-stamp government policy. I\u2019m here to represent people of the ACT on issues and to interrogate whatever is put forward by the government, but I\u2019m not here to stand in the way. I want to be constructive.

On Friday afternoon, Airservices Australia announced it had struck an in-principle 12-month enterprise agreement with the United Firefighters Union Aviation branch and that the union will now withdraw its proposed protected industrial action it had planned for next Friday. Earlier this week, the union had announced firefighters planned to stop work at 27 airports across every state and territory, including Sydney, Melbourne and all capital city airports, on Friday 9 December between 6am-10am. At the time, the union said it was protesting safety concerns arising from low staffing levels, following months of negotiations over a new enterprise deal. The union had mentioned these safety concerns, and demands for minimum staffing level clauses. However in an Airservices Australia statement released on Friday afternoon, only new pay details from the in-principle deal were mentioned. Workers will receive a 4.9% salary increase, the statement said. Airservices Australia chief executive, Jason Harfield, said: \u201cAirservices is pleased to have reached this in-principle agreement with the UFUAV, which puts an end to proposed industrial action next week. This new agreement provides certainty for our ARFFs workforce, airlines and the travelling public. We commend all involved in reaching this new agreement.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted the United Firefighters Union Aviation branch for comment.  Updated at 6.30am GMT    6.11am         5.54am   Key event  Experts tip another rate rise before end of 2022 AAP is reporting that the Reserve Bank governor has left his options open ahead of the final cash rate decision of the year, with experts leaning towards another rate rise for December. Speaking on a panel of central bankers on Friday, Philip Lowe said it was possible to execute a soft landing for the economy. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be pretty easy to be knocked off it, and our priority will be to get inflation back to target over the next couple of years,\u201d he said at the Bank of Thailand and Bank for International Settlements conference. But Dr Lowe also doubled down on the lagging effect of interest rate rises.  It\u2019s quite possible that the lags will be longer this time, partly because of all the savings that people did in the last couple of years.  The RBA governor also revisited his thinking about longer-term inflationary patterns, arguing that the world was likely passing the era of consistently low inflation. Thanks to emerging supply-side challenges including deglobalisation and climate change, he expects to see inflation move up and down more dramatically. For Dr Lowe, the spike in interest rates could be described as the first test in a new economic landscape characterised by fluctuating inflation.  We really want people to believe and understand that when inflation moves away from target ... that it will come back. \u201cIf people don\u2019t believe that, then deviations of inflation from target will be more persistent, and it\u2019ll be harder to get it to come back.  Dr Lowe\u2019s words set the scene for the year\u2019s final cash rate decision on Tuesday. Many economists and experts tip another 25 basis point hike for December.  Updated at 6.02am GMT    5.49am    Woman hit in the face by thrown Guns N\u2019 Roses microphone A woman who was hit in the face by a microphone thrown by Guns N\u2019 Roses frontman Axl Rose has spoken out, saying it felt like she was \u201chit by a truck.\u201d Rebecca Howe said she \u201ccould have lost an eye\u201d when Rose threw the microphone at a concert in Adelaide. She told Channel 10 he threw it after playing the track Paradise City:  It hit me on the bridge of the nose and it felt like I had been hit by a truck. I instantly put my head down, and my brain was like \u2018oh my God, my face has been caved in.\u2019 I saw him throw it but I didn\u2019t see it coming. I was blindsided by all the lights and stuff, and then bang. If it hit me in the eye, I could\u2019ve lost an eye. I still can\u2019t believe it, out of 20,000 people, it was me.    Updated at 5.58am GMT    5.33am   Greens urge stronger health messaging as Covid surges  The Victorian Greens are urging the state government to ramp up pandemic health messaging to help stem the fourth Covid wave prior to an expected Christmas peak. The state recorded 26,971 new cases in the latest weekly reporting period, a 21% increase on the previous week. An average of 550 people were being admitted to hospital with the virus each day, an increase on 430 hospitalisations the week prior. It was the sixth consecutive week admissions with Covid rose. Prior to the fourth wave in October, there were roughly 150 patients in Victorian hospitals with the virus. The Greens are calling for \u201cintensive promotion\u201d of mask-wearing in crowded spaces and improving ventilation via air purifiers, open windows or moving outdoors. They\u2019ve also asked the state government to be \u201cprepared to adopt other measures\u201d like density limits and mask-mandates. Victorian Greens health spokesperson, Dr Tim Read, said the state \u201ccan\u2019t sleepwalk through another health crisis\u201d.  If we\u2019re serious about helping our ambulance and hospital system, we can\u2019t keep watching these numbers increase without doing something. Victoria went into this pandemic with fewer hospital beds per capita than NSW and after years of coping with thousands of Covid cases and Covid-induced staff shortages, our health workers are exhausted. Unless we retain some basic public health measures there will be nothing to slow the next increase in Covid which may not be far away. Asking Victorians to mask up in indoor spaces, use an air purifier or have a Covid booster, is preferable to asking them to wait longer for an ambulance or a hospital bed when they need one.    Updated at 6.31am GMT    5.13am    Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, taking over from the fantastic Emily Wind and Natasha May. There is still much to get through this afternoon, so let\u2019s dive in.      5.05am    Thanks for following along this afternoon, everyone! I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Mostafa Rachwani who will keep you updated throughout the rest of the day.     5.02am    It\u2019s the end of an era for Parliament House\u2019s newspaper room, according to National Radio News reporter Amanda Copp, who tweeted this sad discovery this afternoon.      4.55am    Saturn\u2019s largest moon revealed in greater detail than ever before NASA\u2019s James Webb telescope has released new images of Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan. The moon\u2019s surface has always been hidden because of its dense atmosphere but the Webb telescope\u2019s infrared capacity has captured the dark and bright patches on its surface. Titan is unique in the solar system. It is the only planetary body other than Earth that has rivers, lakes, and seas. Rather than water, they are made up of \u201chydrocarbons\u201d \u2014 molecules like ethane and methane. The two clouds seen by Webb validate long-held predictions that clouds form in the northern hemisphere during Titan\u2019s late summer, when the Sun warms its surface. Follow-up observations by the Keck Observatory also revealed clouds, confirming seasonal weather patterns.   Updated at 5.00am GMT    4.45am    Increased rainfall sees Christmas tree prices rise Aussies keen on a real Christmas tree might be left disappointed as prices are set to skyrocket due to 2022\u2019s extreme rainfall across NSW creating supply issues. Trees shorter than 182 cm are selling for up to $200, an almost 40 per cent increase on previous prices from last year. Sydney was hit by a third consecutive La Ni\u00f1a in 2022, recording more than 286mm of rain during its wettest October on record. Merlino\u2019s Christmas Trees in Sydney\u2019s inner-west says the wet weather has wiped out 40 per cent of their crops this year. Robert Darrigo, from Merlino\u2019s, said:  We had way too much water which caused a lot of root rot. It wasn\u2019t a very warm year so the trees didn\u2019t grow as much.  - from AAP For background on this and the supply of other Christmas items:   Updated at 4.53am GMT    4.32am   South Australia records 12 Covid deaths and 128 people in hospital  There were 9,684 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and eight people are in intensive care. Cases are relatively steady compared to last week\u2019s 9,000 new cases, with hospitalisations down from 140 in the previous reporting period.     4.20am    Home loan approvals decline in October as higher rates dim demand If the Reserve Bank is on the lookout for signs that its elevated interest rates are reducing demand in the economy, housing finance figures out today from the ABS will provide some more evidence. The value of new home loans that were approved in October tallied $25.8bn, down 2.7% for the month, and the lowest level since December 2020, according to RateCity.  The drop, smaller than the revised fall of 4.4% in September, means the value of new home loans was 17.1% lower than for October 2021. The $25.8bn total was neatly divvied up with two-thirds going for owner-occupied homes and one-third for investors. The number of owner-occupier first home buyer loans dropped again in October, down 3.2% from September and off almost 26% from the same time a year ago, RateCity said. A sign that there\u2019s still a bit of competition in the market is shown by the size of refinancing, with $17.84bn in loans between switched to new providers in October. While 1.1% lower than in September, the total remains almost 10% higher than for the same month a year earlier. Whether new or refinanced, mortgage holders are still shying away from fixed-interest loans. In dollar terms, fixed loans make up just 4% of the total compared with almost 50% in mid-2021, RateCity said.  Updated at 4.24am GMT    4.16am    Prime minister Anthony Albanese has taken to social media to reflect on his visit to Gough Whitlam\u2019s family home in Cabramatta, which was officially dedicated today to mark the 50th anniversary of Whitlam\u2019s election.  This morning I went to Gough Whitlam\u2019s family home to celebrate the anniversary of a famous victory, and the home\u2019s preservation. Fifty years ago, people all over Australia voted to change the direction of our nation. At around 11 pm, the street outside this home was filled with cheering supporters and was lit up by the flash of cameras, as Gough returned home and addressed the nation from this lounge room as prime minister-elect.    Updated at 4.21am GMT    4.06am    Tiwi Islanders celebrate \u2018historic victory\u2019 over Santos project Tiwi Islanders say they are celebrating the federal court\u2019s decision to reject Santos\u2019 bid to re-start drilling for its multibillion-dollar Barossa gas project. The full federal court upheld an earlier ruling that Santos\u2019 drilling approval should be set aside because the oil and gas regulator Nopsema failed to properly assess whether the company had consulted everyone affected by the proposed drilling. Tiwi senior lawman Dennis Tipakalippa said the court\u2019s decision would have significant implications for the Barossa gas project, with drilling stalled since early October and Santos now required to go back to the drawing board on their plans:  We want the whole world to hear our voice. We want the whole world to see our power. We have fought to protect our sea country from the beginning to the end and we will never stop fighting. Our sea is like our mother - we are part of the sea and the sea is part of us. Santos and every other gas company must take note that this is our country and we must be consulted.  Santos has been ordered to pay Tipakalippa\u2019s costs. Tiwi mayor and senior elder Pirrawayingi said \u201cthis decision shows that the spirits of our people are always with us\u201d. Environmental Defenders Office special counsel, Alina Leikin, called the decision a \u201chistoric victory\u201d and said the court had \u201cconfirmed unequivocally that Tiwi people have a direct and immediate interest in their sea country and that they must be consulted\u201d.   Updated at 4.15am GMT    3.54am    The two prime ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the swift conclusion of a comprehensive and ambitious EU-Australia Trade Agreement.  Once concluded, a trade agreement between the European Union and Australia would herald a new era in EU-Australia relations and offer significant economic benefits to both sides.  The leaders also condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine as \u201ca clear violation of international law and the United Nations Charter\u201d.  The prime ministers demanded that Russia immediately end its war and withdraw its forces from within Ukraine\u2019s borders. They expressed their commitment to work together with the international community to continue supporting Ukraine.  Albanese and Marin said fighting climate change and protecting biodiversity will require global cooperation.  We need to make rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and act urgently to adapt to climate change in order to reach the goals of the Paris agreement. We affirm our resolve to work with the international community to pursue efforts to keep 1.5 degrees within reach.  For those interested, you can read the full joint statement on the PM\u2019s website.  Updated at 4.14am GMT    3.46am   Australian and Finland strengthen ties  Prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has released a joint statement with Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, after their meeting earlier today. It marks the first visit to Australia by a Finnish PM. The statement says:  Leaders reaffirmed the warm and productive relationship between Australia and Finland, underpinned by a common vision based on equality, trust and shared values. They underlined the need to work together in strengthening their resilience as open and democratic societies and in fostering sustainable development. They agreed that managing complex supply chains, energy sources and investing in trustworthy critical and emerging technologies was needed to promote economic, political, social and environmental stability as well as human rights.    Updated at 4.09am GMT    3.38am   Tesla rolls out its first electric trucks  Vehicle giant Tesla has delivered its first electric semitrailers in the US, with chief executive Elon Musk promising the trucks would \u201clook like an elephant moving like a cheetah\u201d and provide a \u201cstep-change\u201d in transport and emissions. The Tesla Semi, delivered five years after it was first unveiled, promises to travel 800 kilometres on a single charge while fully loaded, and use four independent motors to reach speeds of 96km/h in just 20 seconds. Musk said producing a semitrailer may not seem to \u201cmake sense from a brand standpoint\u201d for Tesla but could make a significant impact on transport emissions.  In the US, there\u2019s 15 million passenger vehicles and 200,000 semi trucks so it seems like a small percentage but it\u2019s actually 20 per cent of US vehicle emissions because you\u2019ve got a huge vehicle and it\u2019s being driven all the time. When you factor in the number of hours driven and the weight that it\u2019s carrying \u2013 although it\u2019s only one per cent of vehicle production it\u2019s 20 per cent of vehicle emissions and it\u2019s over a third of all the particulate emissions. From a health point, particularly in cities, this is a huge impact so that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it.  Tesla also revealed it had developed a megawatt charger to recharge the vehicles \u2013 technology that would later be used with its Cybertruck \u2013 and the truck would feature traction control, regenerative braking, and an automatic clutch. - from AAP   Updated at 3.56am GMT    3.28am    Homicide squad commander praises investigators and Lynette Dawson\u2019s family Homicide squad commander detective superintendent, Danny Doherty, paid tribute to police investigators but gave particular credit to Lynette Dawson\u2019s family for their unstinting efforts to seek justice.  The family and friends of Lynette Dawson never gave up hope, they\u2019ve been the driving force behind this.  Doherty said Lynette Dawson\u2019s case would remain open, and urged anyone with information, particularly about the location of her body, to come forward to police.  Obviously, this is unfinished business, the case is still open because we haven\u2019t found her.    Updated at 3.35am GMT    3.25am    Thanks Natasha! Hello everyone, I\u2019ll be with you all for the next little bit on the blog.     3.22am    Thanks for following along, it\u2019s been a big day of news. I leave you in the hands of my lovely colleague Emily Wind. Have a great weekend!  Updated at 3.23am GMT    3.21am    Reporter:  You spoke about what Gough\u2019s legacy, obviously, meant for you and your family. What feelings do you have when you walk through these halls?  Albanese:  It\u2019s just a sense of honour that someone who was here celebrating with neighbours and the true believers with the Hills Hoist. It\u2019s a very humble home. The Whitlams were big on vision, but big in size as well. And you look at the size of the bedrooms there, where they were crowded in. And it just shows that it is a great country where people of humble background living here in the suburbs made a difference for all of the neighbours and the communities that have come to make western Sydney their home.    Updated at 3.28am GMT    3.13am    Whitlam home dedicated on 50th anniversary of election Today Gough Whitlam\u2019s family home in Cabramatta where he celebrated his 1972 election victory has been officially dedicated on the 50th anniversary of the win. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was at the ceremony:  It is fantastic to be here 50 years to the day when Gough Whitlam declared himself as the prime minister of Australia. The Whitlam government changed our nation, modernised our nation, laid the foundations for the best healthcare system in the world, opened up educational opportunities, changed the way that investment happened in our suburbs, advanced Indigenous reconciliation, and changed our relationship with the world. It is a very proud moment to be here for this restoration and the preservation, for all time, of a part of Australia\u2019s history. And it is important that we recognise our history, that we preserve it, and that we honour it for all Australians. And the Whitlam Institute and Western Sydney University will be able to do that into the future.   Asked about whether his own family home in Camperdown might be next, Albanese said:  Well, it is public housing already, of course. It is still there. But I do drive past there very regularly. And there\u2019s a lovely person lives there and it is now her home. And I think that it is important that we recognise our history.   Updated at 3.19am GMT    3.05am   WA records 14 Covid deaths and 185 people in hospital  There were 11,762 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 4 people are in intensive care. Cases have remained fairly steady since last week\u2019s 10,520 new cases. As of 4pm yesterday, there were 7,229 active cases in Western Australia.     2.57am    Wong on Taiwan joining CPTPP trade deal Both ministers were extremely cautious when asked whether they had a common position on the possibility of Taiwan joining the trade deal known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (a subject of a recent verbal stumble by Anthony Albanese that he later clarified). Mahuta said:  We have a number of applications to the CPTPP. We\u2019ve got the UK, China, Taiwan, Ecuador, and potentially another fifth country coming online. As a repository of those applications, New Zealand has consistently said we welcome applications into the CPTPP. And it must be a high quality, high standards agreement.  Wong added:  I make the same point that minister Mahuta finished on: that this is a high-quality agreement and any application obviously would be assessed on the basis of parties\u2019 capacity to comply with and observe the fullness of the quality of the agreement. Our focus, at the moment, is obviously the UK and I just make the point that any such application would require the consensus of the parties.  Let me explain quickly what the ministers are alluding to: the focus on high standards can be interpreted as a warning that China may not be able to meet those standards in light of the recent trade disputes with Australia. Meanwhile, Wong\u2019s reference to the need for consensus among all 11 current members is a reminder of the practical difficulties that would accompany either Taiwan or China being accepted unanimously. At this stage it appears the UK has the best chance and is first cab off the rank.   Updated at 3.04am GMT    2.53am    NZ welcomes review on rights for its citizens in Australia The New Zealand minister for foreign affairs, Nanaia Mahuta, says she is pleased with indications from the Albanese government about its review of policies towards New Zealand nationals living in Australia. The Australian government has previously said it does not \u201cwant people to be temporary residents forever\u201d and plans to announce improved pathways to citizenship by Anzac Day 2023. It has also suggested that it is looking at aligning the policy on voting in Australia with New Zealand\u2019s rules \u2013 Australians residing in New Zealand for more than a year can vote in local elections. Asked during her visit to Canberra today about Australia\u2019s review, Mahuta said:  We\u2019re certainly pleased with the indications that we\u2019ve had. This is an area where we have an opportunity to work together. But primarily, that\u2019s a matter for Australia to progress. The opportunity for New Zealand is to ensure that we are advocating in the best interests of New Zealanders who make a contribution here in Australia, and we\u2019ll continue to do so.  At the same press conference, the Australian minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, said:  The prime minister has made our position very clear. We want to progress issues that affect the lives of those New Zealanders resident in Australia in ways that recognise our deep friendship and that apply common-sense outcomes. That\u2019s what the prime minister said after his meeting with [New Zealand\u2019s] prime minister [Jacinda] Ardern and we will work through those with New Zealand.   Updated at 3.01am GMT    2.49am    New Zealand interested in Aukus cybersecurity projects New Zealand has expressed an interest in working with Australia and Pacific countries to boost cybersecurity - potentially under the Aukus banner. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and her New Zealand counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, addressed the media after they met in Canberra today. Wong said it was an \u201cexcellent, productive\u201d meeting covering a range of areas including the Indo-Pacific, the war in Ukraine, and Pacific regionalism. Wong said she appreciated New Zealand\u2019s support for Australia to host a UN climate conference in partnership with Pacific island countries in 2026. Mahuta said the two countries shared \u201cmany common perspectives\u201d. Asked about Aukus - which includes plans for nuclear-powered submarines, but also other work with the US and the UK on advanced technologies - Wong said:  I think New Zealand is aware of our rationale and our intention in relation to Aukus, which is about being able to ensure regional stability. At a time where there is a lot of competition and contest in the world, Australian comes to those arrangements, just as we come to our regional engagement, with the same perspective and the same objective. We want a region that is peaceful, that is stable, that is prosperous, and in which sovereignty is respected and all of our work - whether it\u2019s in our defence capability, or our diplomacy, or our engagement in education, on our labour movement position in relation to the Pacific - these are all about working towards that sort of region and ensuring all aspects of Australian power and Australian government engagement are directed to that end.  While the nuclear-powered submarines are clearly a joint project of Australia, the US and the UK, the three Aukus countries have signalled that other aspects of the security partnership could be done together with other close partners. Mahuta said:  The Aukus arrangements aren\u2019t a set of arrangements that New Zealand are a part of, neither do we seek to be a part of, however we have indicated that where there is a opportunity across the region to cooperate, for example, in areas such as cybersecurity, we remain open to those conversations.

Updated at 2.45am GMT    2.35am    \u2018No sentence is long enough\u2019: Lynette Dawson\u2019s family  Simms has taken some questions outside court, first saying he did not believe that Lynette\u2019s body will ever be found:  I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever give it up. His non-parole is 18 years. He\u2019ll be, what, 92, if he lives that long? I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll give up where she is.  Simms was asked if Dawson displayed any emotions today:  No. No emotions whatsoever.  Simm\u2019s wife, Merilyn Simms, said no sentence was going to be long enough:  No sentence is long enough for taking someone else\u2019s life. But it was very interesting to hear the way the judge came about making that decision. So, 24 years \u2013 wonderful. He may not live for 24 years, but I hope he lives for quite a long time.

Simms said he and his family would like Lynette to be \u201cremembered as Lynette Joy Simms\u201d and that her family \u201creally never believed this day would come\u201d:  At last, we have justice for Lyn, and that was our main aim. For our family, Lynette will always be remembered as a happy, loving, gentle sister, aunt, niece and friend. Chris Dawson discarded her. The Dawsons disregarded her. From today on, we would like her to be known and remembered as Lynette Joy Simms. No sentence is long enough for taking someone\u2019s life. Today is in recognition of the hard work so many people have done to get the resolution we needed. We want to pay special tribute to the family and friends who worked in an unofficial capacity over the last almost 41 years, being Helena, my mother, my sister Pat, my brother Phil, all the aunts and uncles and cousins, and Lyne\u2019s friends. The system was against us, but we got there in the end. Once again, a huge but inadequate thank you to all the contributing police, Judge Harrison, the incredible barristers and solicitors from the DPP, the media for their support, and especially to Hedley Thomas and his team for from The Australian, and also Ben Fordham. My hope is that the media and police will work collaboratively in future cases. We really didn\u2019t believe this day would ever come. What we need now is to find Lyne and put her to rest. It\u2019s our time to begin living our lives without having this hanging over our heads. Chris Dawson has had 40 years of freedom. Now, it\u2019s our turn.

The full federal court on Friday dismissed the company\u2019s appeal, upholding an earlier decision that the offshore gas regulator should not have approved drilling in the Barossa gas field, 265km north-west of Darwin. Tiwi Islander Dennis Tipakalippa in June launched legal action against Santos, claiming he was not consulted over the company\u2019s environmental plan for the Barossa gas field. The Munupi elder said he feared the project could damage his people\u2019s sea country. Federal court judge Mordecai Bromberg in September ruled in Tipakalippa\u2019s favour, finding the regulator should not have approved the environmental plan. He ordered for the approval to be set aside and drilling to be stopped, but Santos appealed the decision. The $US3.6bn ($A5.5bn) offshore natural gas development was expected to create up to 600 jobs and pipe gas 280km to the Darwin LNG facility when production began in 2025. The company has previously said the project, which was 43% complete and on schedule before the September court decision, is one of the world\u2019s lowest-cost new LNG supply projects.  Updated at 2.34am GMT    1.56am    Security sweep of Victoria ministerial offices was routine: DPC The Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC) has released a statement saying that a security sweep of all ministerial offices and cars conducted during the past week was routine, and planned several weeks ago. The statement follows a report in Herald Sun this morning, which claims the Andrews government ordered the \u201chighly unusual\u201d sweep just days after being elected to a third term. Victorian DPC secretary Jeremi Moule said:  Reports this morning that the security checks have been ordered by the incoming government are incorrect. The activities were planned several weeks ago and were to be implemented by the department regardless of the outcome of the election. Office security sweeps were undertaken on Friday and Saturday when they became available and vehicles from Sunday morning, also based on availability.   Updated at 2.32am GMT    1.51am    Chris Dawson\u2019s lawyer says his client \u2018maintains his innocence\u2019 Greg Walsh, Chris Dawson\u2019s lawyer, is speaking outside the supreme court following his client\u2019s sentence being handed down:  In respect of the sentence, and of course, ladies and gentlemen, there\u2019s no winners in a tragic case like this. Lynette\u2019s family have lost their daughter, their sister, their mother. And the extended family has also suffered, as has the community. So far as Mr Dawson is concerned, he now of course will spend in all probability the rest of his life in jail. And will not have the relationship that he otherwise would have had with his own children, and Susan, his wife, and extended family. As his honour found, it\u2019s a matter of enormous severity in the sense of seriousness. That\u2019s what I really mean. The murder of a loving and caring mother and wife is clearly an extremely serious crime. And his honour has recognised that. And in particular, not only the loss of her life, but the impact of that loss on the direct relatives and the wider community. As far as Mr Dawson is concerned, he maintains his innocence, I and his lawyer have acted in the accordance with his instructions and he maintains his innocence.   Updated at 2.30am GMT    1.46am    Penny Wong addresses Neil Prakash\u2019s arrival in Australia The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, spoke to the media in Canberra alongside her New Zealand counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta. We\u2019ll have more updates about their meeting shortly, but Wong was also asked about Neil Prakash\u2019s arrival in Australia to face terrorism charges. Wong told reporters:  In relation to Mr Prakash, I\u2019d refer you to the AFP statement. I can confirm that Mr Prakash was taken into custody, he obviously faces serious terrorism [charges]. He is scheduled to face a Darwin court today, an application will be made to extradite him to Victoria, and there he will be charged by the AFP-Victorian joint counter-terrorism team. The AFP has issued a statement that makes clear that there is no threat to the Australian community. Other than that, it\u2019s a matter before the courts, so that\u2019s as much as I\u2019ll comment now.   Updated at 2.27am GMT    1.42am   Penny Wong salutes 'the grace, the bravery and the dignity' of Brittany Higgins  The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, made some brief remarks at a press conference in Canberra when asked about the decision by prosecutors to drop charges against Bruce Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins. In the first trial, Lehrmann pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, denying that any sexual activity had occurred. Wong told reporters:  Given the serious health concerns that the DPP referenced today, I obviously am going to be very cautious about what I say, but I want to echo the prosecutor\u2019s comments recognising the grace, the bravery and the dignity that Ms Higgins has displayed.   Updated at 2.25am GMT    1.28am   Chris Dawson sentenced to 24 years in jail  Justice Ian Harrison has declared that Chris Dawson, convicted of murdering his wife Lynette, will be sentenced to 24 years in jail, with a non-parole period of 18 years.  Mr Dawson is not old by contemporary standards, but he will not live to reach the end of his non-parole period. I recognise the unavoidable prospect is that Mr Dawson will probably die in jail. Mr Dawson, would you please stand? For the murder of Lynette Dawson on or about 8 January 1982, I sentence you to imprisonment for 24 years, commencing on 30 August 2022 and expiring on 29 August 2046, with a non-parole period of 18 years. The first day upon which you will become eligible for release on parole is therefore 30 August 2040. I note the provisions of the act have potential application to you. Mr Walsh may be expected to provide you with further information about that. Are there any other matters before I adjourn? Mr Dawson, would you please go with the officers now.   Updated at 1.37am GMT    1.25am    Justice Ian Harrison:  His denial of responsibility for that crime has benefited him in obvious ways.  He references the fact that Dawson went on to marry and a have a child with JC.  Updated at 1.26am GMT    1.20am    Inside the courtroom of Chris Dawson sentencing Chris Dawson is sitting alone in the dock, wearing a green prison-issue tracksuit. Justice Ian Harrison has told the court Dawson killed his wife Lynette Dawson at their home in Bayview in January 1982 for the \u201cselfish and cynical purpose\u201d of allowing him an unfettered relationship with his babysitter JC.  Lynette Dawson was faultless and undeserving of her fate \u2026 she was also completely unsuspecting. Lynette Dawson was treated by her husband \u2026 as completely dispensable.  Justice Harrison described the crime as premeditated and planned, a \u201cself-indulgent brutality\u201d.  Updated at 1.25am GMT    1.17am   Judge to take into account \u2018self-indulgent brutality\u2019 in sentence of Chris Dawson  Justice Ian Harrison of the supreme court has begun to speak ahead of delivering the sentence of Chris Dawson, who was convicted of the murder of his wife Lynette Dawson. Harrison has noted the effect of Dawson\u2019s concussions on his consciousness, the fact he has shown no remorse and had no previous convictions. Harrison also said he would take into account the \u2018self-indulgent brutality\u2019 of the murder. My colleague Ben Doherty is in the courtroom and will bring you more on the sentencing.  Updated at 1.24am GMT    1.00am    \u2018Surprise\u2019 finding on lockdown opioid use The number of Victorians using opioid painkillers plummeted when Covid-19 restrictions first kicked in and picked back up after the state came out of a mammoth lockdown. The findings have surprised Monash University researchers, who initially expected more people to rely on opioid painkillers during the height of pandemic restrictions. Lead study author and pharmacist Monica Jung said:  We hypothesised mental health conditions experienced during the pandemic may have coincided with higher rates of people using opioids, particularly because stress can exacerbate pain. However, those numbers actually fell, perhaps due to fewer face-to-face medical consultations, cancelled elective surgeries, and fewer incidents of physical trauma because most of us were isolating at home.  The drop-off could have also been down to Victorians being unable to get medical appointments and prescriptions during the pandemic, Jung suggested. The study compared two periods in 2020 \u2013 the first, the week starting 23 March, during which stage-two restrictions kicked in and non-essential services were forced to shut their doors. The researchers looked at all 10 opioids listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, including morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl. The study has been published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. \u2013 from AAP  Updated at 1.07am GMT    12.50am    Magenta named Pantone\u2019s colour of the year for 2023 It exists between blue and red, warm and cool, to be found on a spectrum all its own.

Under the laws, consumers will have stronger protections from payday lenders, which offer consumers fast cash but can commonly charge over 200% in annual interest rates. The payday lending and consumer lease reforms passed the Senate late last night. The Consumer Action Law Centre\u2019s Gerard Brody said the measures would stop vulnerable borrowers from repeat lending and falling into debt spirals. Assistant treasurer Stephen Jones said Australians urgently needed protection from predatory lending over the Christmas period. The newly enshrined legislation includes a 10% cap on the amount of a person\u2019s income that can be taken up in loan repayments. The financial regulator will also be empowered to crack down on convoluted contract structures used to skirt responsible lending requirements. The new rules will also aim to stop the predatory marketing of these kinds of loans and consumer leases. \u2013 from AAP  Updated at 12.43am GMT    12.23am    The IR bill is now set to become law, despite a late filibuster effort from shadow employment Michaelia Cash in the upper house last night.

Updated at 12.31am GMT    12.14am    Greens release statement on criminal justice system after Lehrmann charges dropped Greens senator Larissa Waters, party spokesperson for women and democracy, has released a joint statement with senator Sarah Hanson-Young about the criminal justice system in the wake of this morning\u2019s announcement. ACT prosecutors have dropped charges against Bruce Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins. He had pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence throughout. The statement from Waters and Hanson-Young says:  The Greens support the work being done to identify problems with criminal justice responses to sexual violence and strengthen trauma-informed approaches and wrap-around services. In particular, we welcome the recent endorsement of the Work Plan to Strengthen Criminal Justice Responses to Sexual Assault by all attorneys general and the commitment of the ACT government to make victim-survivors\u2019 recorded testimony admissible. In light of the strength and resilience Brittany Higgins has shown and the change she has already driven to reform parliamentary culture, the Greens will push anew for this and other procedural protections to be rolled out nationally as a matter of urgency. At this time it is important to remember the toll that any sort of criminal proceedings take and the broader impact of intense coverage in deterring people from coming forward. This week the Senate established an inquiry into the ways that consent laws impact survivor experience of the justice system. We will be working through that inquiry to ensure survivors are supported to seek justice and start their recovery.

Other times she will be in the shower and will start to worry after noticing there is no more soap or shampoo. Jackson said:  You can\u2019t afford them all at once. Oh, God. It\u2019s horrible. Or a light blows. Sometimes I could have four light globes out. And you\u2019re swapping them from room to room.  Jackson, who lives in social housing in Hobart, is among about 800,000 people in Australia living on a jobseeker payment that has been set well below the poverty line. Her experience mirrors those explored in a new report, to be released by the Australian Council of Social Services and the University of New South Wales today, which investigates the lives of people in poverty in Australia. Read the full story here:   Updated at 12.05am GMT    11.50pm    December RBA rate rise becoming an even-money bet The next big economic news for Australia will land next Tuesday when the Reserve Bank board meets on interest rates. Quite a bit of Christmas shopping probably hinges on the outcome. A pause by the RBA would mean the cash rate sits at 2.85% until at least February when the board is next scheduled to gather.  For now economists are now mostly tipping the RBA will still lift its rate by 25 basis points to make it a record eight increases in as many months. If so, the 300bp increase since May would also make it a more aggressive spell of hikes since the second half of 1994 when the rate went up 2.75 percentage points. As of yesterday, investors were betting on about a 50-50 chance of a 25bp rise on Tuesday. The recent weakish economic numbers, such as a dip in inflation in October, has also encouraged some pullback in expectations of how high the RBA will go it before stops raising rates.  We\u2019ll also get September quarter GDP on Wednesday, making for the last big week of economic data for 2022.     11.41pm    The New Zealand foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta is in Canberra today where she has just participated in a welcome to Country, ahead of talks with Penny Wong.      11.33pm   Accused jihadist Neil Prakash in Australia  Accused Islamic State jihadist Neil Prakash \u2013 once considered the country\u2019s most wanted terrorist \u2013 has landed in Australia to face charges that could see him behind bars for life. The Melbourne-born former rapper was flown from Turkey to Darwin on a chartered flight on Friday morning ahead of a scheduled court appearance for extradition to Victoria. Prakash was arrested and jailed in Turkey after allegedly flying to Syria to fight with Islamic State. The 31-year-old is expected to face court in Darwin, where Australian Federal Police officers will apply to have him transferred to Victoria and charged with terrorism offences. Prakash could face a life sentence if found guilty. In 2016, he was wrongly thought to have been killed in a US military strike in the Iraqi city of Mosul, however later the same year Australian officials confirmed he was still alive and had been arrested in Turkey. Former home affairs minister Peter Dutton revoked Prakash\u2019s citizenship in 2018 over his alleged IS participation and on the grounds he was Fijian. Fijian immigration officials insisted Prakash, born to a Fijian father, had never held nor sought citizenship and refused to take him into the country. Prakash rose to prominence over his alleged links to several terror plots in Australia and use of social media to lure potential recruits to IS. In a statement, the AFP said its officers maintained a thorough framework to manage Australians facing terrorism offences and there was no threat to the community. \u2013 from AAP  Updated at 11.46pm GMT    11.23pm   Brittany Higgins in hospital  Brittany Higgins is in hospital and receiving treatment and support, her close friend Emma Webster said. In a statement, Webster described the last two years as \u201cdifficult and unrelenting\u201d. She said:  Brittany is in hospital getting the treatment and support she needs. The last couple of years have been difficult and unrelenting. While it\u2019s disappointing the trial has ended this way, Brittany\u2019s health and safety must always come first. Brittany is extremely grateful for all the support she has received, particularly from our mental health care workers.  Prosecutors have just announced they will not proceed with a retrial, saying it is not in the public interest because of the significant danger it would pose to Higgins\u2019 life.   Updated at 11.29pm GMT    11.08pm   Two independent medical experts say ongoing trauma of prosecution presents unacceptable risk to Higgins: Drumgold  Prosecutors have dropped charges against Bruce Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins. This is what the ACT director of public prosecutions Shane Drumgold had to say speaking from Canberra:  I closely considered the reasonable prospect to conviction test when I first examined the brief of evidence in the week of 21 June 2021 and I formed a clear view that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction and this is a view that I still hold today. The non-exhaustive list of public interest tests, include section 2.9 paragraph being the actual or potential harm occasioned to any person as a result of the alleged offence which in this context includes the actual or potential harm occasioned by the ongoing prosecution of an alleged offence. In short, I need to consider the harm that could be occasioned to a party, particularly a complainant from an ongoing prosecution. I have recently received compelling evidence from two independent medical experts that the ongoing trauma associated with this prosecution presents a significant and unacceptable risk to the life of the complainant. The evidence makes it clear that this is not limited to the harm of giving evidence in a witness box, rather applies whether or not the complainant is required to enter a witness box during a retrial. Whilst the pursuit of justice is essential for both my office and for the community in general, the safety of a complainant in a sexual assault matter must be paramount. In light of the compelling independent medical opinion and balancing all factors, I have made the difficult decision that it is no longer in the public interest to pursue a prosecution at the risk of the complainant\u2019s life. This has left me no option but to file a notice declining to proceed with the retrial of this matter which I have done this morning. This brings the prosecution to an end. Before concluding, during the investigation and trial as a sexual assault complainant, Ms Higgins has faced a level of personal attack that I have not seen in over 20 years of doing this work. She has done so with bravery, grace and dignity and it is my hope that this will now stop and Ms Higgins will be allowed to heal.   Updated at 11.22pm GMT    11.03pm   ACT DPP drops case against Bruce Lehrmann  Prosecutors have dropped charges against Bruce Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins. Director of public prosecutions Shane Drumgold has announced the shock move exercising his discretion to discontinue proceedings. The decision means the retrial of Lehrmann, expected in February, will not proceed. Lehrmann had maintained his innocence to allegations that he raped Higgins, a colleague and fellow political staffer, in the office of the then defence industry minister, Linda Reynolds, in March 2019. He pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, denying that any sexual activity had occurred at all.

AAP reports, Mahuta said:  We are closely aligned in our responses to regional and global challenges, and we share aspirations in common with fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum closer to home. I anticipate discussion on cooperation in the Pacific, including support for Pacific nations for mitigation and adaption to the impacts of climate change, and on the geo-strategic situation in the wider Indo-Pacific.  They will also discuss Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine and Iran\u2019s human rights violations in the wake of the deadly protests against its authoritarian regime.

Higher wages are a deliberate design feature of this government\u2019s policies.One of the first things we did as a government was help secure a pay rise for Australia\u2019s lowest paid workers. We have also supported aged care workers to secure a wage rise.  They also flagged further reform in the workplace relations space when the house sits again next year:  The Secure Jobs Better Pay bill is the next step in that commitment \u2013 but it won\u2019t be the last.The government will deliver a second tranche of workplace relations reforms next year to close the loopholes that are undermining job security and wage growth.   Updated at 10.11pm GMT    9.55pm    Albanese and minister for employment issue statement after passing of IR bill The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, have issued a joint statement following the Secure Jobs, Better Pay bill passing federal parliament just now:  By modernising the bargaining system we will see more workplace agreements, delivering better productivity and flexibility for employers and better pay and conditions for workers.We\u2019re bringing our workplace relations system up to date with a government that wants to get wages moving again.  They said the new laws also:  Reform the Better Off Overall Test so it\u2019s simple, flexible and fair. Put gender pay equity at the heart of the Fair Work Act. Ban pay secrecy clauses that hold back women\u2019s wages. Expand access to flexible rostering arrangements. Limit the use of fixed term contracts. Ban job ads that advertise below minimum rates of pay. Terminate WorkChoices \u201czombie\u201d agreements. Give the Fair Work Commission more powers to arbitrate industrial disputes.

Allegra Spender will not be voting for the bill (she will be abstaining) as she says she has concerns over the bill still, but will be holding the government to account if there are any unintended consequences. Dai Le said she wished there was longer for consultation, and that many small businesses in her electorate of Fowler were unaware of the bill. She says she will also be holding the government to account.     9.35pm    Guardian Australia\u2019s photographer at large Mike Bowers is in the lower house capturing its last sitting for the year as the IR bill receives final approval.

Updated at 9.37pm GMT    9.27pm    Adam Bandt and Zali Steggall speak Adam Bandt is highlighting the role of the Greens in the negotiations, thanking Tony Burke and his staff for their conduct during those negotiations. He then took issue with Peter Dutton\u2019s complaints that the bill will end the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) which Bandt is wholeheartedly in support of abolishing the commission, which he said gave people less rights than those in other industries, just because of where they worked. So he\u2019s happy to see the end of it. The Coalition manage a few guffaws in response, but Bandt gets some rah-rah from the Labor side of the chamber and balance is restored. The speeches move on to Zali Steggall who said she still has some reservations for small businesses, but she spoke to her constituents who said they wanted the ideology stripped from the debate. Steggall has some questions for the small business minister about the impact small business, which she is about to get to.

Albanese is asking the Opposition to \u201cname one\u201d small business which closed because of the increase in the minimum wage (the last time the Coalition said the world would end and businesses would close). Albanese says he is proud to pass this legislation on the 50th anniversary of Gough Whitlam\u2019s election win.

Shorter Burke: Things will be better now! We love workers. Wages should go up!  Shorter Dutton: This is the most terrible bill in the world. We love workers. Labor loves unions. So, the usual. Dutton is now arguing that the IR bill is an \u201cimposition\u201d because of the inflationary circumstances. I\u2019m not sure if he remembers that workers spend money at the businesses he is saying will close. Anthony Albanese is now speaking, accusing Dutton of an \u201cideological rant\u201d.     9.08pm     Senate amendments to IR bill about to pass House Tony Burke is on his feet and moving that the amendments be agreed to. The House is doing all the amendments together. Burke thanks David Pocock and the Greens for their negotiations and those who participated in negotiations, even when they didn\u2019t agree. The amendments are about to pass the House \u2013 then it\u2019s off to the governor general for royal assent.  Updated at 9.15pm GMT    9.07pm    Before the IR bill gets its final approval in the lower house this morning, Rishworth was asked how quickly those feminised industries can expect to see a pay rise:  Putting gender equity in the objectives of the Fair Work Act is a critical component to actually ensure those in feminised industries can fight for pay rises. By this legislation passing, it starts the process of enabling particularly low-paid feminised areas to actually use the Fair Work Commission to actually get a pay increase \u2013 of course that\u2019s what the multi-employer bargaining is about as well.   Updated at 9.13pm GMT    9.03pm    Good morning from Canberra. After a long night for the Senate, which Murph, Paul Karp and Mike Bowers stayed in for, to the bitter end, the House is back bright and early this morning to pass the Senate amendments. It was Labor\u2019s Christmas party last night, although we hear it was a fairly tame affair given everyone knew they had an early start. There is another big shindig tonight for Labor \u2013 it is the 50th anniversary of Gough Whitlam\u2019s election and the Whitlam family home will be officially dedicated. But first, there is the business of passing the Senate\u2019s amendments to the IR bill. The House is up and it is straight into it.  Updated at 9.14pm GMT    8.59pm    Rishworth defends superannuation stance There are still calls on the government to add superannuation payments to paid parental leave. Rishworth is asked if it\u2019s something the government is committed to looking at in this term of parliament:  We\u2019ve set up the women\u2019s economic equality taskforce to look at a range of issues. Along with our childcare changes and our paid parental leave, we have really put women\u2019s economic participation front and centre of this government, as a priority.   Updated at 9.13pm GMT    8.53pm    Rishworth calls for Dutton to \u2018be a leader\u2019 on Indigenous voice The Liberals have yet to state how they will be campaigning on the voice but the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has criticised a \u201cbewildering\u201d lack of detail. Rishworth has labelled Dutton\u2019s position \u201cdisingenuous\u201d \u2013 merely trying to create uncertainty about something that is essentially a \u201csimple proposition.\u201d  I think this is disingenuous by the opposition leader, there is plenty of detail of what a model would look like. His party is clearly divided. He needs to be a leader when it comes to this.   Updated at 9.11pm GMT    8.42pm    The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, is now speaking with RN Breakfast. She is today announcing funding for young children with a newly diagnosed disability or emerging developmental concerns. Rishworth says it will be a \u201ccomplement\u201d to the NDIS.  We\u2019ll be actually providing social and emotional support for children with a disability and their families things like playgroups \u2026 and other activities to ensure kids are best prepared for school. It is money that should be seen as a complement to the NDIS. We know there are a lot of children and adults living with a disability that don\u2019t qualify for the NDIS and we need to make sure there are supports and services in place for those people as well.  Patricia Karvelas:  There\u2019s been concern that some participants on the NDIS, particularly children, should be receiving care through the education system \u2013 will this funding help that?  Rishworth:  This funding is for 0 to eight-year olds, so it is about preparing them for school. This is not the sole responsibility of the NDIS, we need to get all our service system meeting the needs of children living with a disability. So, this money is part of that, but there is a lot more that needs to be done.   Updated at 8.51pm GMT    8.34pm    Fifteen minutes left in Costa Rica v Germany at World Cup It\u2019s all going off at the Qatar World Cup in the final round of Group E fixtures. Costa Rica have a live chance of upsetting Germany, but with 15 minutes to go anything is possible. You can follow that much as well as Japan v Spain on our dedicated live blogs:    Updated at 8.49pm GMT    8.30pm    \u2018It would be damaging\u2019 if Liberal party don\u2019t support the voice, Spender says The Liberal party have not yet said how they will campaign on the voice, even though their junior Coalition partner, the Nationals, have come out in opposition to it. The teal independents have all unseated Liberals in blue-ribbon seats and Spender believes if the Liberals go the way of the Nationals they will continue to turn away their base in these seats.  This is absolutely a crucial issue in my communities in every single politics in the pub or public event I had, people asked me about my support of the Uluru Statement of the Heart and the voice, and I was unequivocal. And I think absolutely it would be damaging to the Coalition \u2013 the Liberal party \u2013 if they rejected this. My community is really passionate about listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about what they want and ensuring they support that.   Updated at 8.48pm GMT    8.21pm    Spender does not believe model for voice needs to be legislated before vote The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, says there is a building bewilderment at the lack of detail on the voice, but Spender has told the program she does not believe more detail is needed because any change in the constitution should be about principles. Spender confirmed she does not believe there needs to be a model in legislation before a vote takes place.  I support the government in where it is going and I support that the parliament of the day will determine what that looks like. I think the constitution is about principles. And this is a question of changes to the constitution. This is not a question of changes of legislation. I don\u2019t agree actually with where Peters Dutton\u2019s coming forward. And I also think that there have been a number of reports including to the parliament, about the principles of the voice, which I think are very clear.  Spender is asked about David Littleproud\u2019s concerns about differentiations in representation of communities as diverse as Redfern and Cape York:  Look, I think, countries change and communities change and if we were trying to enshrine something today that was going to be perfect, it wouldn\u2019t be right for 50 years time necessarily if you\u2019re trying to get that detail of how the Cape York versus the Redfern communities are represented. I think the principle of this that the Australian people will be voting on, which is that should the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a voice to the parliament on on the policies and legislation that specifically affect them? And the answer to that is yes.   Updated at 8.28pm GMT    8.17pm    Labor briefs independents on voice to parliament Hello! Natasha May on deck with you now. The government has briefed a group of independent MPs providing more details about the referendum and the Indigenous voice to parliament. The member for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, was part of that briefing and has spoken to RN Breakfast this morning, saying it was given because \u201ca lot of us are passionate about support this\u201d.  This is something that will be there to support to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a voice on the services that affected them. That is the fundamental reason why I\u2019m supporting this is because we, you know, we spent decades with policies and laws that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but they do not have the voice in terms of making sure that this is actually what the community\u2019s want.   Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.03pm    Matt Kean attacks Morrison over secret ministries The New South Wales treasurer, Matt Kean, has given Scott Morrison a spray on Q&amp;A over his secret ministries, the ABC reports, and called for Australians to judge the former prime minister at the ballot box. He told viewers:  I strongly disagree with [Morrison] on what he did, with regard to assuming powers without telling the electors. Transparency and integrity is at the heart of our democracy. For people to have confidence in our system of government, our politicians and our political class need to be transparent with what we\u2019re doing and that\u2019s not what happened with Scott Morrison. The best way to deal with these issues is letting the public decide.   Updated at 8.19pm GMT    7.46pm    Don Farrell flies to Europe for free trade talks The trade minister, Don Farrell, is flying to Europe to seek progress on a free-trade agreement with the EU. Farrell will visit Paris, Brussels and Berlin in a trip that also includes Bern in Switzerland and London. In a statement, he said he would use meetings in the first three cities \u201cto advocate for the conclusion of important negotiations for an ambitious and comprehensive Australia-European Union (EU) trade agreement\u201d, describing it as \u201cone of our highest trade policy priorities\u201d. The discussions would also include how Australia could support Europe\u2019s energy transition, including through the development of critical minerals and green hydrogen supply chains.  My visit will also signal the Australian government\u2019s support to our friends and partners in Europe as they face challenges associated with Russia\u2019s illegal, immoral and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.  Farrell said he would open the new Australian embassy to Switzerland in Bern. He said he would use his stop in London to \u201cadvance the Australia-UK free trade agreement, highlighting that Australia has completed all domestic requirements to implement the agreement, and encourage the UK to finalise remaining steps to ensure it enters into force early next year\u201d.  Updated at 8.19pm GMT    7.10pm   Welcome  Good morning and welcome to the live blog. My colleague Natasha May will be along shortly but first the stories making news overnight. The top story from the end of the parliamentary session was success for Labor in passing the industrial relations bill to overhaul workplace bargaining. The reforms \u2013 the biggest for decades \u2013 passed the Senate last night with support from the Greens and David Pocock, defying a late Coalition filibuster attempt led by former employment minister Michaelia Cash. The trade minister, Don Farrell, said: \u201cIt gives us the opportunity to really, really get wages moving again.\u201d It will get final approval in the lower house this morning. There was also late-night Senate success for territory governments who finally regained the right to make their own laws about assisted dying after senators voted to overturn a 25-year-long ban. Senators cheered and hugged as the territory rights bill passed and finance minister and ACT senator Katy Gallagher branded it \u201ca really significant and historic moment\u201d. The ACT\u2019s second senator David Pocock said the bill came off the back of years of advocacy and stoic people coming forward and telling their stories. Our medical editor, Melissa Davey, has exposed the way in which vaping has led to spiralling levels of nicotine addiction among young people. She has more terrific reporting this morning after listening to the tragic stories of parents and doctors grappling to help children deal with the crisis. We also have an explainer about how bad the problem has become and how teenagers have become addicted in the first place.  Updated at 7.13pm GMT "

                    "body": "  3.59pm    We are about to close the live blog. Thank you for following developments here in Sharm el-Sheikh during the first week of Cop27. These are the highlights from today:  Russian oligarchs and executives from multiple companies under international sanctions are among the lobbyists attending Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh. US climate envoy, John Kerry, said his country was \u201ctotally supportive\u201d of moves to address loss and damage, one of the most contentious issues at these talks, and \u201c100% ready\u201d to discuss the issue in detail. Mexico has announced an improved greenhouse gas emissions target, though it is still far short of what is needed, according to activists. A demonstration by a few hundred protesters was permitted inside the Cop27 venue in Egypt although they have not been allowed to march en masse in the streets. The four Indigenous and youth activists from the US who briefly interrupted Joe Biden\u2019s speech yesterday with a war cry and banner have had their Cop accreditation revoked.    Updated at 4.01pm GMT    3.35pm   Kiribati president: we need money to physically raise our islands  There are few countries more in the crosshairs of the climate crisis than Kiribati \u2013 a small, low-lying island nation in the Pacific Ocean that has struggled to get the help it needs from wealthy countries to avoid being submerged by the seas. Its president, Taneti Maamau, has an audacious plan to physically raise the islands to protect them but this will take billions of dollars and rich countries have been slow to respond with climate finance, he said. \u201cThey have to honour their commitments and pledges,\u201d he said of developed countries. \u201cThey need to open their ears more clearly, and their minds. They know what the issues are but I don\u2019t know what is holding them up.\u201d Maamau said he listened to Joe Biden vowing to act on the climate crisis at Cop27 but said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the same voice will hang on for the next four or five years. It\u2019s midterm elections in the US.\u201d \u201cThey should act, because time is short for us,\u201d he added. \u201cSome prefer to negotiate but we say no, it\u2019s time for action. We demand action now. For too long we have waited and waited. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d   Updated at 3.48pm GMT    3.25pm    As food day continues, you\u2019ll be hard pushed to attend an event without hearing buzz phrases such as \u201cequitable transition\u201d, \u201csoil health\u201d and \u201cregenerative farming\u201d. But in reality, two conflicting visions for food systems are unfolding at Cop27 on agriculture day. In the negotiating rooms, the agenda is mostly focussed on making industrialised agriculture bigger and better, which means more public-private support for fossil fuel fertilisers and tech solutions for climate resilience. This is also the narrative at the Food Systems Pavilion, where green fertiliser, carbon mapping and carbon markets, and methane reducing additives were among the innovations discussed during today\u2019s climate resilient panels. In a Dragon\u2019s Den inspired event, judges heard pitches from climate tech entrepreneurs whose ideas included a digital app connecting subsistence farmers with suppliers, a roadmap for \u201csustainable fertliser\u201d in Africa as an emergency response to food insecurity, and satellite mapping to guide pastoralists.  Earlier in a decarbonisation panel, Rob Cameron, the global head of public affairs at Nestl\u00e9, the world largest food and drinks company, said the firm had developed its own regenerative agriculture model. \u201cWe\u2019re on it because we need to move fast. It\u2019s good that others are moving slowly and consulting with Indigenous people and small farmers \u2026 eventually we will converge,\u201d said Cameron. Nestle, which has pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, last year generated almost as many greenhouse gases as Nigeria. Betty Chinyamunyamu, the CEO of the national smallholder farmers association in Malawi, told Cameron that farmers were part of the solution, and should not just be considered as recipients. \u201cWe need more collaboration and mutual benefits. Everyone must be a winner, there should not be winners and losers.\u201d After running through three buildings, getting lost and tripping up, the Guardian made it to the Food4Climate pavilion where the vision is about transformation, sustainable, healthy food systems and agroecological farming as an alternative to the current industrial system. A two-hour panel discussion on subsidies is a hard sell at this stage of the week, but it\u2019s what\u2019s propping up the fragile global food system that is failing on the environment, food security, human health and animal welfare, according to the panellists. Here are a couple of jaw dropping stats: about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the food system \u2013 71% of those are down to agriculture and land use change (deforestation, fertilisers, methane emissions). Subsidies play a major role in deciding what and how food is produced, yet at least 90% of the $540bn in global food subsidies have been deemed harmful to the planet, according to UN research.  Much of the world\u2019s population is either undernourished or overweight, signalling that we\u2019re not producing or eating well. \u201cSubsidies are a major change agent. They make it hard for farmers to make changes, and stop consumer driven market changes from naturally taking place. This is not a level playing field,\u201d said Stephanie Haszczyn from the Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return (FAIRR) initiative. Subsidies are not on the Cop agenda, but they should be, said Patty Fong from the Global Alliance for the Future of Food. \u201cFarmers are locked into an industrialised system and can\u2019t get out of it. We are eroding sophisticated traditional knowledge about Indigenous varieties and weakening community resilience. Neither farmers nor consumers are benefiting.\u201d One more shocking food fact to finish with: despite the climate crisis already battering food supplies, only 3% of public climate finance has so far gone to food, and today\u2019s announcements suggest that much of the new money coming out of Cop27 will be from the private sector.  Updated at 3.41pm GMT    3.08pm   US \"100% ready\" to discuss loss an damage - Kerry  John Kerry said the US was \u201ctotally supportive\u201d of moves to address loss and damage, one of the most contentious issues at these talks, and \u201c100% ready\u201d to discuss the issue in detail. \u201cWe have engaged with our friends to work through the proposals,\u201d he told a press conference at Cop27 on Saturday. \u201cWe want to engage.\u201d He said that Joe Biden, who visited the talks briefly on Friday, was also supportive. \u201cWe are 100% ready, [the president] has said, to discuss the issue of loss and damage. That\u2019s why it\u2019s on the agenda. We want to come to closure.\u201d Loss and damage refers to the impacts of extreme weather so severe that countries cannot adapt to them, and the negotiations revolve around how to provide financial assistance for developing countries afflicted by extreme weather, which can destroy their infrastructure and tear apart their social fabric. Discussions of loss and damage as \u201ccompensation\u201d to developing countries from the rich, or \u201cliability\u201d on the part of developed countries, as some activists have sought to frame the issue, are specifically excluded from the negotiations, and have been since the 2015 Paris agreement. Asked by the Guardian when the US would start paying into a finance facility for loss and damage, and whether China should also pay into such a facility, Kerry said: \u201cIt\u2019s not fully defined, what is a facility. There are all kinds of different views on what it could be. No one can sign up to something on it, not yet \u2026 We are not at the [financial] facility discussions yet.\u201d  He added: \u201cBut we want to engage on something very real.\u201d On the issue of whether China, whose emissions are far larger than any other developing country, should pay for loss and damage in the poorest nations, he did not name China but referred to such countries indirectly. \u201cThere are a whole bunch of countries that have also contributed to where we are, so how do we manage that?\u201d He went on: \u201cWhat we want to make sure is that we come up with something that satisfies people who are serious, and that we will come out with an agreement [in which] we are confident what the financial arrangements should be.\u201d He pledged: \u201cWe will find a way to have financial arrangements that reflect the reality of how we are all going to deal with the climate crisis. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d Kerry also sought to reassure those concerned that countries were backsliding this year from commitments made at Cop26 in Glasgow to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. \u201c[Sameh] Shoukry [the Egyptian foreign minister who is president of the talks] does not intend to be the country that hosts a retreat from what was achieved in Glasgow,\u201d he said. \u201cMost countries here have no intention of going backwards.\u201d But he said countries that had not set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in line with the 1.5C temperature limit agreed in Glasgow. He did not name the countries he meant. On the question of US relations with China, he said there had been informal discussions between the countries at Cop27, but no formal meetings. Joe Biden is expected to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, next week when the G20 meet in Bali from Tuesday. Kerry added: \u201c[We are] waiting to see how things go at the G20.\u201d  Updated at 3.28pm GMT    2.59pm   Half time reports  Thank to you everyone who has sent through their half time reports on Cop27. Please continue to send comments and questions to @pgreenfielduk on Twitter or patrick.greenfield@theguardian.com.  Fanny Petitbon from the NGO CARE France told our environment editor, Damian Carrington, that negotiators must reach an agreement with substance on loss and damage, a key point of division between countries in week one at Cop27.  Now that we have a foot in the door, we must smash it open and secure a loss and damage finance facility [and] deliver critical support for populations who bear the brunt of climate impacts, especially women and girls in the global south. The time for endless talking is over.  Kate Norgrove from WWF UK says that the climate summit has produced little so far and that governments are not taking the necessary action on global heating.  So far sadly all we have seen is woeful inaction on net zero and protecting the planet. We are deeply concerned by slow progress at the summit in agreeing the future of [action] on agriculture. Our food system contributes around one third of greenhouse gas emissions and is also the number one cause of biodiversity loss \u2013 it cannot be kicked into the long grass any longer.  On agriculture day at Cop27, several people said that governments needed to do more on farming reform, referencing the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture, a UN decision that highlights the potential of farming to help tackle global heating.   While in the conference venue, IUCN press officer Matthias Fiechter and Christina Isherwood would like to see the Cop27 organisers make it slightly warmer. Although we are in the middle of the desert, it gets cold inside the pavilions, especially in the afternoon and evening.    Updated at 3.08pm GMT    2.30pm    Back in the UK, the debate over windfall taxes on oil and gas companies \u2013 which have been posting record profits since the war in Ukraine broke out \u2013 rages on. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has been briefing to the press that the government has decided to raise the windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to 35%. Currently, the UK government has put an extra levy of 25% on the firms, on top of the existing 40% tax, bringing the total tax to 65%. The rise would bring it up to 75%. Though raising the levy by 10% would be welcomed by green groups, it still does not go as far as the oil and gas super-producer Norway, which has an overall levy of 78%.  The thinktank Green Alliance previously worked out that hiking up our tax to meet Norway\u2019s could raise \u00a333.3bn extra by 2027, plugging a hole in government finances and helping keep energy bills low. However, the idea has clearly triggered the fossil fuel companies, who call the proposed levy \u2013 which would still be below other country\u2019s including Norway\u2019s \u2013 a \u201csupertax\u201d. Offsure Energy UK, which represents the oil and gas companies, has said they would be \u201cdriven out\u201d of investing in the UK if the tax was raised, and accused Hunt of \u201cthreatening\u201d them. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re completely taken aback by this, coming just days before the chancellor gives his fiscal statement. Our industry plays a critical role in providing reliable and responsible supplies of energy to the UK, with all the benefits that brings in generating taxes, secure energy and jobs for UK workers.\u201d However, these complaints could be regarded as slightly empty, as there is a sunset clause on the windfall tax of 2025, and there is a loophole which allows companies to claim back tax if they invest in the UK. This meant that Shell, for example, paid no windfall tax.  Updated at 2.46pm GMT    2.22pm   'The legitimacy of the loss and damage has never been as high' - Johan Rockstr\u00f6m  It\u2019s half-time at Cop27, so to get some thoughts on how it is going so far, I caught up with Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who has been attending Cops for almost 20 years. \u201cI came into this Cop with very low expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at an all-time low on trust\u201d between nations, he said, due to geopolitical tensions, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the energy price crisis, economic gloom and politicians backing off from climate action, for example, in his native Sweden.  The issue of loss and damage, the compensation demanded by poor nations for climate destruction, is prominent at Cop27, but has long been divisive. \u201cThe global north and the global south have very big difficulties in coming to a consensus on how to handle it. But, for every year that passes and emissions rise further, climate extremes get worse and worse,\u201d he said. Scientists can now rapidly attribute the influence of global heating to more severe and frequent climate disasters, Rockstr\u00f6m noted: \u201cSo the legitimacy of the loss and damage has never been as high as today.\u201d But Cop27 has gone better than he expected: \u201cI\u2019ve been positively surprised that so many heads of state have come to COP, such as President Biden. That in itself is a truly important thing, as it shows the climate transition has passed the [political] tipping point. We are at the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel-driven world economy. There\u2019s no going back any more. The question is will we do it fast enough?\u201d He is also relieved that \u201cnothing has blown up so far\u201d. \u201cI remember at the halfway point in Paris [in 2015], the 2C was off the table. The fear was also that this would be a Cop where all civil society would be shut out and the youth would have no voice, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d Looking forward, Rockstr\u00f6m spelled out the outcomes he was hoping for by the end of Cop27. \u201cNumber one is that we come to a settlement on loss and damage, with the constructive countries in the north giving enough to the most vulnerable developing countries, so everyone feels they leave with a reassurance we are taking things seriously.\u201d He said there also needed to be significant progress on commitments to cutting emissions, by the ratcheting up of the pledges that most countries were meant to have already done by Cop27: \u201cIt\u2019s so we can come back towards a feasible plan to hold to the 1.5C target.\u201d Lastly was the money, Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cWe need to have a serious discussion on how we can start scaling carbon pricing markets and use this to raise the possibility of filling up the funds.\u201d The $100m by 2020 first promised by rich nations in 2009 has yet to be delivered, with the US, Canada, Australia and the UK billions short of their \u201cfair share\u201d, and very little pledged to loss and damage.  Updated at 12.07pm GMT    1.59pm    Marina Silva, who was Brazil\u2019s environment minister under Lula\u2019s first presidency during which there was a large drop in deforestation in the Amazon, has been speaking with reporters at Cop27. She said it was not going to be easy to slow deforestation rates in the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, especially as many of the people that could help do so were under threat by the current government.  Lula\u2019s government is determined to implement policies aimed at rigorously combating deforestation. The goal is to fight all criminal practices to achieve zero deforestation in all Brazilian biomes. A very big concern is what is happening now in the Amazon. It\u2019s not an easy process. There was a dismantling of all environmental policies, but we believe that by rearranging the budget, the teams on ground resuming the plan, which has already worked in the past and reduced deforestation by 83% in almost a decade, and updating these policies we are going to achieve a good result.   The incoming Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is set to attend Cop27 next week, with the transition of power under way from the outgoing far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro. Silva discussed a proposed alliance of rainforest countries, which would include Indonesia and the DR Congo, saying she wanted to help protect the world\u2019s forests, not just Brazil\u2019s.  Brazil won\u2019t make money a condition for protecting its forests [under Lula]. That is a difference between us and the previous government\u2019s approach. The previous government always said that \u201cto protect the forests, the native peoples, we must be paid\u201d. Brazil has already shown that it can [stop deforestation] with its own efforts. We want partnerships, we want cooperation, to develop the bioeconomy in the area of \u200b\u200bscience, technology \u2026 We are not doing this with conditions. But we think that countries that are middle- and low-income countries need [more money], and Brazil will be committed to seeking these resources and without the anxiety of wanting to compete for these resources.   Updated at 2.49pm GMT    1.39pm   Russian oligarchs and lobbyists from sanctioned companies at Cop27  Russian oligarchs and executives from multiple companies under international sanctions are among the lobbyists currently attending Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, reports the Guardian\u2019s Ruth Michaelson. Among those at the pivotal climate talks are the billionaire and former aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska, who is under UK sanctions, and the billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, the former head of the Russian fertiliser company the EuroChem group, who has been targeted with individual sanctions by the European Union which he disputed, calling them \u201cabsurd and nonsensical\u201d. Gas giant Gazprom, currently under American and EU sanctions, has sent six delegates to the crucial climate talks, alongside the managing director of Sberbank, which is also facing sanctions in Washington and Brussels. Representatives from oil company Lukoil, mining company Severstal, and Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works are also in attendance, all of which are also currently under US sanctions. The Gas giant Gazprom has sent six delegates to the talks, alongside the managing director of Sberbank. Both are under US and EU sanctions.

Please send comments and questions to @pgreenfielduk on Twitter or patrick.greenfield@theguardian.com. We are keen to get your halftime reports on how you think Cop27 is going and your hopes for week two. Thanks!   Updated at 2.50pm GMT    1.01pm    Patricia Espinosa, the UNFCCC executive secretary from 2016 to 2022, isn\u2019t just here attending events, she\u2019s also promoting her new consultancy firm OnePoint5 \u2013 a reference to the temperature rise target that seems increasingly hopeless given the 1% rise in global emissions last year, and the seemingly unabated investment in new fossil fuels projects. Espinosa is more hopeful: \u201cI think that the science is very clear, we need to aim at 1.5, and we have examples that it is feasible and people are committing. I was just at the UAE pavilion, where the minister launched the pathway for net zero with a specific commitment by 2030, 2040 and 2050, so it can be done.\u201d The UAE, which will host Cop28, has 70 oil and gas representatives among its delegation including three fossil fuel CEOs. Scientists agree that rapidly slashing fossil fuels is the only way to keep hopes of 1.5 alive. \u201cWe need to have those industries also on board,\u201d said Espinosa. Not everyone agrees. \u201cClimate criminals should not be in this space deciding the solutions,\u201d said Aderonke Ige, associate director of Corporate Accountability. At the end of the first week, it\u2019s clear that climate activists are furious at the UNFCCC allowing polluters \u2013 fossil fuel companies, banks that enable them and Big Ag that relies on them \u2013 to be omnipresent in Cop spaces while frontline communities and small scale farmers are not only largely absent from the formal talks, but struggle to even get access to the summit. The Guardian asked Espinosa if Cop had become too corporate: \u201cIf you look at the fact that we really need every company in the world to change, I wouldn\u2019t say so. And actually, I hope that they go faster and push the governments in the right direction. I think they are also realising that they\u2019re the survival of their business.\u201d  Updated at 1.14pm GMT    12.50pm    Tzeporah Berman, who is heading the push for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty (see 9.44am), has tweeted pictures of the towel art she has been returning to at her hotel after the conference each night:  G\u00f6k\u00e7e Mete, another delegate, responded with an image of more towel art from what looks like a different hotel.       12.28pm   Mexico improves climate targets  Mexico has announced an improved greenhouse gas emissions target, though it is still far short of what is needed, activists have said. Here\u2019s the Associated Press\u2019s report:   Mexico announced on Saturday it is raising its target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and boosting the rollout of renewable energy, though it remains a regional laggard on climate action.  Foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico would aim to reduce emissions by 35% compared with doing nothing by 2030. That\u2019s up from an unconditional pledge of 22% cuts it had made two years ago. To achieve this goal, Mexico will double its investments in clean energy over the next eight years, expand protected forest areas, boost electric car use and reduce methane emissions from its natural gas industry. Unlike many national climate targets, Mexico\u2019s does not define cuts in relation to a specific baseline year but compared to what\u2019s project under a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario.  My colleague Nina Lakhani wrote earlier this week about Mexico\u2019s inadequate carbon pledges and the regressive policies of president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Read more here:   Updated at 2.11pm GMT    12.07pm   Protests inside the venue  A demonstration by a few hundred protesters has been permitted inside the Cop27 venue here in Egypt \u2013 they have not been allowed to march en masse in the streets. Speakers raised loss and damage, the compensation poor nations are demanding for climate destruction, the rights of women and children, and of political prisoners. The speakers were introduced by a campaigner wearing a \u201cFree Alaa\u201d T-shirt, in support of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the British-Egyptian citizen on hunger strike in an Egyptian jail. \u201cWe are not silenced \u2013 we are unheard,\u201d said Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate activist from the Philippines. She also raised the failure of rich, polluting nations to pay for loss and damages: \u201cThis is their debt to us and they have to pay it to us.\u201d \u201cYou will never get rid of us,\u201d said another speaker. \u201cWe will get stronger and, when we are gone, our children will replace us.\u201d Placards in the crowd included \u201cPay your climate debt\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t gas Africa\u201d, \u201cTrade unions 4 just transition\u201d, \u201cReparations for damage to water\u201d and \u201cWomen of the territories are healers of the Earth\u201d. The chants taken up by the crowd covered \u201cThe people united will never be defeated\u201d and, referencing political prisoners, \u201cFree them all\u201d. Sin\u00e9ad Magner, 28, from Tipperary in the Republic of Ireland, is part of the women and gender constituency, a group of NGOs. \u201cRight now we are destroying nature in the relentless pursuit of profit, but also on the backs of women,\u201d she said. Unpaid work by women in farming, caring and elsewhere is worth $11tn a year, she said. Magner said it felt powerful to joining with activists at Cop, but said the summit was becoming \u201ca circus, like a business expo\u201d. She said: \u201cPeople are losing faith in the process.\u201d    Updated at 12.14pm GMT    11.34am   \"I am a vegan who loves the taste of meat\u201d - Guardian editor tries cultivated chicken  It is food day at Cop27 and it is clear from the science that the climate crisis cannot be ended without a big cut in meat eating in rich nations. I\u2019ve written a lot on the huge damage meat production causes, and about going vegan as a result. But now I have eaten meat for the first time in four years \u2013 cultivated meat. The Singaporean clay pot in front me looks appetising \u2013 it may also be a glimpse of the future. The \u201cwhole chicken pieces\u201d are Good Meat\u2019s latest innovation, grown from cells in a food facility and requiring the slaughter of no birds. It is my first taste of cultivated meat and I am a little nervous. I\u2019ve lost the taste for dairy milk and fish since going vegan. But the smell from the little barbecue is encouraging \u2013 I\u2019ve missed barbecues.  The chicken pieces are served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, broccoli and rice, with a little chilli, a deliberately simple dish. \u201cWe are not trying to hide behind anything,\u201d says chef Chris Jones. He wants the meat to be the focus when people try it for the first time. So what is it like? The first thing I notice is the texture, firm and with proper bite, a little crispy on the outside. The flavour is authentically chicken, subtle but unmistakable. In both respects, it is far superior to the various plant-based chickens I have tried. They have all been perfectly palatable, but wouldn\u2019t fool a carnivore. The chicken tastes like thigh meat, more flavoursome and moist than breast meat, and that\u2019s not an accident. \u201cIt\u2019s a better flavour profile,\u201d says Jones, who works in product development for Good Meat, and says it cooks just like regular chicken. The promise of cultivated meat is that it can provide a no-compromise alternative to regular meat, without the vast environmental damage. \u201cWe are really proud of this chicken,\u201d says Jones. But we always want feedback and are looking to make it better, he tells me. My feedback is simple: get the scale up, the price down, and get it on to more plates. Good Meat was the first company to sell cultivated meat to the public, in Singapore. The company matches the price of their meat with regular meat for Singapore restaurants and food shacks, which means taking a loss. \u201cWe are not making money on it at the moment,\u201d says Andrew Noyes, who head global communications at Good Meat. \u201cBut it is important to get it out there and into people\u2019s mouths, and get them talking to their friends and families.\u201d He says the key will be getting regular people, like the ones he grew up with in rural West Virginia, to eat cultivated meat. The company is building the world\u2019s largest vats for cultivated meat and is in the process of getting regulatory approval in the US and Qatar. The latter, like Singapore, is very reliant on food imports, making the small footprint of cultivated meat attractive. Cultivated beef is next in the product pipeline, Noyes says, and Israeli firm Aleph Farms just debuted its cultivated steak. In the UK, the chicken pieces I was served would be called goujons, and they are the third generation of the product that first went on sale in Singapore as a chicken nugget. They are 75% meat and 25% proprietary plant protein mix, as per the regulatory approval. I am the first to try them at Cop27 \u2013 the \u201cguinea pig\u201d, Jones jokes \u2013 but delegates will be served the chicken across this weekend, culminating with a ministerial dinner on Monday. One issue with cultivated meat has been the use of a serum from cow foetuses in the cell growth medium. Noyes says they now use an animal-free serum in research and development, and will make the switch in Singapore when approved by regulators. As I leave, I bump into Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, Good Meat\u2019s parent company \u2013 he has just arrived at Cop27. \u201cI am a vegan who loves the taste of meat,\u201d he tells me. It turns out, so am I.  Updated at 2.09pm GMT    11.04am    After six years as the big cheese of UN climate negotiations, Patricia Espinosa has been enjoying walking the halls of power not quite as an ordinary Joe and apparently isn\u2019t closely following the negotiations. \u201cIt has felt just amazing. I knew that as the [UNFCCC] executive secretary that I was missing so much, and it\u2019s been a really wonderful experience.\u201d Espinosa might not be paying close attention, but we\u2019re starting to see developed countries push back against this year\u2019s hot topic, loss and damage, after developing nations laid out a unified case for why a funding mechanism separate to climate adaptation and mitigation is needed to address the climate catastrophes that can\u2019t be averted. The US in particular has been accused of being a \u201cbad faith actor\u201d due to its long track record of disrupting and delaying progress on the issue. \u201cYes, I can understand why people are saying that. Their reluctance on having an agenda item on loss and damage, and the fact that we are only now starting to really seriously talk about it is very surprising, because the losses and damages have been there for all these years.\u201d But, and it\u2019s a big but, while developing countries and climate justice activists want a firm pledge to create a loss and damage mechanism at Cop27, Espinosa thinks we\u2019re not there yet. \u201cIt is possible that there is a need to have some more conversations about what we mean by loss and damage and what we want to address.\u201d Back to the US, which has also been accused of bullying countries and getting special treatment \u2013 for example, having way more experts and advisers in meeting rooms than allowed. \u201cI used to recommend to the chairs of the different groups that they should remind everybody that this is a harassment-free space, and that it is not acceptable to vote to cross certain lines. It\u2019s not that I want to justify any specific country \u2026 people need to be open about it.\u201d Last but not least, once again we\u2019re seeing developed nations focussing on loans \u2013 not grants \u2013 for developing countries. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not fair. The issue of finance is really at the centre of the process and the fact that the pledge for mobilising $100bn has not been delivered is really very disappointing. It is very clear that the international financial system is not responding to the current needs of the world, especially of the most vulnerable countries that are bearing a lot of the costs. So that has to change.\u201d  Updated at 11.13am GMT    10.49am   Lack of enthusiasm for Biden and Pelosi  There has been grumbling among climate activists over what they regard as insipid appearances by Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi at Cop27. Biden and Pelosi spoke strongly on Friday about the need to confront the climate crisis but neither dwelled on what is known as loss and damage, the animating issue of these talks for developing countries hit hardest by droughts, flooding and other climate impacts. The US has yet to meet its prior promises for climate finance and has previously stymied the concept of loss and damage. Pelosi\u2019s press conference was particularly galling, with the speaker of the US House of Representatives holding a sort of rote committee on domestic issues with fellow Democrats and only taking one question from the press afterwards. Biden, meanwhile, was interrupted by US indigenous activists demanding an end to fossil fuel extraction at home. \u201cThe president, members of congress and the state department have come to this international forum on climate change proposing false solutions that will not get us to 1.5C,\u201d said Big Wind, 29, a member of the Northern Arapaho tribe in Wyoming who was part of the protest. Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said the US\u2019s \u201cradio silence on loss and damage finance, offering insurance instead of real money while vulnerable countries have ramped up their demand for a finance facility proves once again how out of touch Biden is with the reality of the climate crisis\u201d. The climate group 350.org said there was a \u201cglaring\u201d absence of loss and damage in Biden\u2019s speech and pointed out the hypocrisy of the US president urging other countries to stop financing fossil fuels while The US continues to pour billions of dollars into overseas oil and gas projects. \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s leading polluters, the pledges made by United States\u2019 President Biden fall well short of the expectations of communities facing devastation from the impacts of the climate crisis,\u201d said Charity Migwi, Africa regional campaigner for 350.org. \u201cReal climate action from a \u2018climate leader\u2019 would entail phasing out fossil fuels, providing much-needed loss and damage finance, and supporting the just transition to renewable energy in Africa. This would send a strong signal to other industrialised nations to take urgent action.\u201d  Updated at 12.06pm GMT    10.34am    More photos are coming through of protests outside the conference centre this morning.     Updated at 10.39am GMT    10.06am   Indigenous activists have accreditation revoked  The four Indigenous and youth activists from the US who briefly interrupted Joe Biden\u2019s speech yesterday with a war cry and banner have had their Cop accreditation revoked.  Jacob Johns, 39, a Washington state-based community organiser from the Akimel O\u2019otham and Hopi tribe, said the decision to oust them set a terrible precedent for the UN climate negotiations. \u201cWe come to this global platform to be heard because in America we are criminalised for defending air, water and environmental rights, and even though the president said in his speech that Indigenous people have the solutions, it was tokenism; we are not listened to.\u201d \u201cWhen we raise our voices we are deemed a security threat, it\u2019s ridiculous and exposes the hypocrisy of these negotiations,\u201d Johns added. The protest lasted just a few seconds, before the \u201cPeople vs Fossil Fuels\u201d banner was confiscated and the four protesters sat down. According to John, an Egyptian security official asked why they were screaming and wearing feathers, before they were escorted out of the plenary hall into a backroom by UN security staff. Johns said: \u201cThe UN security said that our war call had put people\u2019s lives in danger, and we were now deemed a security threat. Our badges were pulled and we had to leave.\u201d Johns, who is here with Climate Action Network, and Jamie Wefald, 24, Big Wind, 29, and a fourth unnamed individual, who are here with SustainUS, are appealing against the UNFCCC decision. Johns raised money through small individual donations to attend Cop27, and has been closely following negotiations on loss and damage, article 6 and Indigenous peoples. \u201cI\u2019m here as an organiser focused on policy work, and as an Indigenous person, not as a victim. We were calling out the blatant greenwashing by Biden, who was here selling false solutions like carbon offsetting and corporate partnerships that will not solve the problems we are facing. For my voice not to be heard would set a terrible precedent.\u201d The Guardian has requested comment from the UNFCCC.  Updated at 12.06pm GMT    9.44am    The proposed fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty is raising its profile at Cop27, with the US senator Edward Markey becoming the first US politician to back the call. The UN talks have set plenty of targets to cut fossil fuel emissions, but none to cut their supply. That\u2019s the gap the treaty aims to fill, addressing the root cause of the climate crisis. Without such a treaty, Tzeporah Berman, the chair of the initiative, told the Guardian \u201cit is like trying to cut with one half of the scissors\u201d. The treaty idea was inspired by nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaties and began with discussions between Berman and Mark Campanale, the founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, in 2016. The first article calling for the treaty was published in the Guardian in 2018, written by Andrew Simms and Peter Newell. The US is one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of fossil fuels and Markey told delegates at Cop27: \u201cThe US cannot preach temperance from a bar stool. We cannot tell other countries what to do if we\u2019re not doing it ourselves. That\u2019s why today, I am publicly supporting the call for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.\u201d There is far more coal, oil and gas in company and government reserves than can ever be burned if global heating is to be kept to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Markey, a long-time supporter of climate justice, has also told the campaigner and writer Bill McKibben that he intends to organise Democratic senators to demand the firing of the World Bank president, David Malpass. Malpass, a Trump appointee, has been mired in controversy over his commitment to climate action, and faces calls from many nations for major reform of the institution. Read more on the treaty and its growing support in this explainer:   Updated at 10.04am GMT    9.24am    A report released early this morning by campaigners Reboot Food finds that enough protein to feed the world could be produced in an area smaller than London.  The report suggests that if animal protein was grown through fermentation in tanks, rather than livestock in fields or barns, it would be a 40,900 times more efficient use of land.  The technology to make this happen is still at an early stage, but rapid advances have been made in recent years. My colleague Helena Horton has the full story here:       9.02am    There is a heavy police presence in Sharm el-Sheikh for a protest outside the conference centre. At midday local time (10am GMT) we are expecting to see a march through the conference centre itself, but it is not clearly how tightly policed that will be.    Updated at 10.05am GMT    8.47am   Food, agriculture and adaptation day at Cop27  Today is food day in Sharm el-Sheikh, the first ever dedicated day to agriculture and adaptation in a Cop - which is mindblowing given that a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from industrialised food systems and the devastating effects the climate crisis is having on farming and food security. Big agri-business and industrial agriculture is set to receive significant support from some governments in the main negotiating halls, where we expect to hear lots about \u201cclimate smart agriculture\u201d and tech-driven solutions that will largely tinker with the current industrialised systems rather than push transformative change. One to watch is the session on the US-UAE initiative \u2013 the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) which has already garnered at least $8bn in private-sector support. Small-scale and Indigenous sustainable farmers who produce 70% of the world\u2019s food will not play a big role in the main negotiations but, outside the halls, will call for a fair share of subsidies and additional climate finance to build more diverse and resilient food systems that the IPCC says help to buffer temperature extremes and sequester carbon. Outside the main negotiations there are dozens of food-focused side events taking place, and the Guardian will attempt to bring you a flavour of these throughout the day. Just as a quick reminder on why climate and food matters: 37 million people face starvation in the Greater Horn of Africa after four consecutive droughts; unprecedented floods battered Pakistan\u2019s major agricultural regions; and record-breaking temperatures throughout Europe have led to drastically reduced crop yields. Add to that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which has caused global shortages and price hikes in wheat, oilseeds and fertiliser, underscoring the fragility of the fossil-fuel dependent food industry that has sacrificed diversity, sustainability and resilience for mass production and profits.  Updated at 12.05pm GMT    8.27am    Bill McGuire, the author of the recent book Hothouse Earth, has written for the Guardian this morning about his pessimism that the target of keeping global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will be met.  In retrospect, it is clear that having a specific target, rather than fighting to stop every fraction of a degree in temperature rise, has actually been counterproductive. There is a perennial problem with targets, and that is that they are always still reachable \u2013 until they aren\u2019t. In this way, they can be used to justify inertia right up until it is too late. And this is exactly how fossil-fuel corporations, world leaders and others have used 1.5C \u2013 as a get-out-of-jail card to justify inaction on emissions. Continuing to present this temperature threshold as an attainable target provides a fig leaf for business as usual. Take it away, and this dangerous jiggery-pokery is exposed for all to see.  You can read the full piece here:   Updated at 10.11am GMT    8.22am    Good morning, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of day six of the Cop27 climate talks taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh. As we reach the end of the first week, Saturday\u2019s theme is \u201cadaptation and agriculture\u201d. It\u2019s also traditionally the day most focused on protest, although that will be limited this year due to the Egyptian government\u2019s draconian crackdown on protests. However, there will be lots of other actions around the world. On Friday, Joe Biden made a flying visit to the conference, where the US president made a speech saying world leaders \u201ccan no longer plead ignorance\u201d and that \u201cthe science is devastatingly clear \u2013 we have to make progress by the end of this decade.\u201d My colleague Oliver Milman was there, and you can read his report here:  You can also catch up on the rest of the day\u2019s events here.

On Tuesday the SES\u2019s chief of operations, Tim Wiebusch, said October was both Victoria\u2019s wettest month on record and the busiest for his volunteers. \u201cOctober was the biggest month on record for volunteers, and this is off the back of what is now regarded as Victoria\u2019s wettest month on record,\u201d Wiebusch said during a state control centre briefing. \u201cSES volunteers have now responded to 13,689 requests for assistance during October.\u201d The previous record was set a year earlier during the June 2021 storms, when there were more than 10,700 requests for help, largely in the Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges. Two Victorians had died in the floods, which began in mid-October, while thousands of homes had been inundated and millions of dollars worth of crops damaged.

Residents in flood-affected communities had also been warned of a gastroenteritis outbreak due to contaminated flood water.  Wiebusch said the flood emergency was \u201cfar from over\u201d. \u201cWe still have water storages that are at capacity, we\u2019ve got catchments that are now saturated, and we still have the climate drivers of La Ni\u00f1a and also the negative Indian Ocean Dipole, which means that we are likely to see above average rainfall for at least another six to eight weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will only take another large rainfall event for us to see our rivers in Victoria go back to major flood levels.\u201d He said communities along the Murray River would be at particular risk of moderate to major flooding in the coming days. Thousands of sandbags had been distributed in Swan Hill, though Wiebusch said it was likely the town centre would probably be spared. It comes as flood-affected businesses, charities and primary producers will be able to receive up to $200,000 in grants as part of an $877m support package announced by the state and federal governments on Tuesday. Under the scheme, grants of up to $50,000 will be made available to eligible businesses and not-for-profit organisations to aid recovery efforts, including rebuilding infrastructure and replacing damaged assets. Primary producers and rural landholders will be eligible for grants of up $75,000, while medium and large-sized businesses directly affected by the floods will be able to receive up to $200,000. This is in addition to concessional loans of up to $250,000, already announced by the federal government. Affected sporting and recreational clubs will also be able to receive $5,000 to assist with their recovery as part of the new package, while $22m has been allocated to support services to facilitate the development of recovery plans, assist in grant applications and provide mental health support. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in a statement the additional grants would \u201censure Victorian business can rebuild with confidence\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure flood-affected business owners and communities have the support they need to rebuild and return to trade as quickly and safely as possible,\u201d said the premier, Daniel Andrews.  Federal government support payments of $1,000 for an adult and $400 for a child have been available for residents of dozens of local government areas for several weeks, while the Victorian government has provided one-off payments of $5,000 for affected small businesses and $10,000 for primary producers. Any grant received through the existing Victorian programs will be included in the maximum amounts available in the latest round on offer. Victoria\u2019s emergency services minister, Jaclyn Symes, said the government would contact those who had applied for the initial grants to let them know they were eligible for additional funds. In addition to the $877m package, the state government will spend $152m to support flood-affected Victorians with housing, household bills and legal support."

                    "body": "A fortnight after facing each other in the Women\u2019s Super League, the two Manchester clubs came up against each other in the FA Cup. The WSL match was a tight affair, which City dominated and edged courtesy of a sublime chip from 20 yards out by Caroline Weir. With United sitting fourth in the WSL table and City fifth, the tie would be a tight one to call especially as league form naturally goes out of the window in any derby cup clash.   Manchester City fans await the arrival of the teams, including Ellen White (below left) and Lauren Hemp (below right).      Amongst the City fans waiting outside Leigh Sports Village were John (above centre right) and David (above centre left). John said: \u201cIt\u2019s my first time I\u2019ve come to watch this \u2026 yeah it\u2019s usually the men\u2019s team. This old man here now (David) has started to watch the women\u2019s and he loves it. So hopefully it\u2019s a blue win.\u201d  A mum with two children, the daughter is a City fan and the son is a United fan. When asked for a prediction of the score \u2013 daughter: I think 2-1. Son: err \u2026 2-1 to United. Mum: I\u2019m going 2-1 United. (Her City fan daughter groans).         The match was broadcast live on BBC Two, with presenting duties being taken by Alex Scott (top right), Rachel Brown (middle left) and Willie Kirk (middle right). The team\u2019s WSL match in October 2021 attracted a record peak audience of 1.1m on BBC One and there were also 114,000 live streams of the 2-2 draw on BBC Sport online.   United started brightly, pressing and harrying their neighbours and took the lead after 13 minutes when captain Katie Zelem\u2019s corner looped in at the far post. City\u2019s attempts to get back into the game during the rest of the first half were stymied by United\u2019s impressive defensive display with the visitors being restricted to a couple of half-chances.   Some of the 2,335 fans who attended the match at the Leigh Sports Village.       City made two changes at half-time with Vicky Losada and Jess Park making way for Hayley Raso and Caroline Weir and they made an instant impact, with Raso providing the cross which Lauren Hemp slotted home at the far post. The visitors continued to pile on the pressure and had their noses in front eight minutes later when Ellen White pounced on a weak header back to her keeper by United full-back Hannah Blundell, calmly rounded Mary Earps and slotted home. On the hour mark another United error led to another City goal when Earps allowed Weir\u2019s left-footed shot to squirm under her and inside the near post. Khadija Shaw added a fourth in the 79th minute with her first touch after coming on, smashing the ball into the roof of the net from two yards out after Hemp\u2019s shot was parried into her path by the United keeper.      Manchester United\u2019s Diane Caldwell picks the ball out of the net after White scored City\u2019s second goal (top), Weir fires home the third and celebrates with fellow goalscorer Hemp (middle) and Shaw (above) celebrates scoring the fourth goal with teammates. City\u2019s substitute Julie Blakstad surges forward as the visitors search for a fifth goal (below). Manchester United\u2019s goalkeeper Earps puts a disappointing match behind her as she signs a young fan\u2019s England shirt (bottom).     It was derby delight once more for City who made it to the quarter-finals courtesy of a stunning second half display which led to a thumping 4-1 triumph over their neighbours. The Manchester side will again face north-western opponents in the quarter-finals when they host Everton.

                    "body": "  9.09pm   Richard Jolly on Liverpool and J\u00fcrgen Klopp       8.08pm    Here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s report from the City Ground.       8.07pm    Liverpool are in their 25th FA Cup semi-final, though they have not been in the final since 2012, and they last won the competition in 2006. Wembley hasn\u2019t really been Anfield South in recent years, but the League Cup and now that date next month with City, those days might be coming back soon.      8.01pm    Diogo Jota speaks to ITV after the game.   It was a tough game they are a great team, they played with a lot of intensity. [Offside goal] Yeah, I thought it was tight, you never know. They had one big, big, chance and they gave us a proper challenge. It was a really tough game but we are in the semi-final;. We fought, we fought really hard.       7.56pm    This was the moment that swung it, though there were others, too. Forest fans will rue the missed chances and perhaps the penalty that never was.      7.54pm   Full-time: Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool  A match befitting of the occasion of 23 years apart, some real effort by Forest, Liverpool given a fright as they go through to face Manchester City in the semi-final. The FA Cup has been very good this season, and now the biggest guns will be in the last four. And Crystal Palace. Forest gave everything, but Liverpool\u2019s quality told, and Jurgen Klopp is congratulating Forest players on their efforts.    Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.51pm    90+5 min: Just a few seconds away from Wembley for Liverpool now...     7.50pm    90+3 min: That penalty, that miss from Zinckernagel, the Yates header just now, Forest have had their chances. And there will be post-match rage about the non-penalty. Tinfoil hats aplenty....but what\u2019s this? Cafu has one, the ball dropping down, his control perfect, his shot just wide. Not bad for a 51-year-old....     7.48pm    90+1 min: Liverpool trying to kill this one off by wasting time, there\u2019s been a few scares for them on the way to this narrow lead.      7.47pm    90 min: On ITV, the rarity of a losing player getting man of the match as Lee Dixon chooses Forest\u2019s Joe Worrall, who has given everything for the cause. Five minutes added on.      7.46pm    89 min: Forest go again, and Johnson skips to the wing, with four waiting in the middle. Yates gets on the end of it but the header is straight at Alisson.      7.43pm    87 min: Van Dijk is down after a clash with Cafu. He\u2019ll be OK but Liverpool will be taking their time.      7.43pm    85 min: There\u2019s a penalty shout...Yates skates past Alisson and goes down. There\u2019s calls for VAR, and it looks as if he deliberately leaves his boot to be hit. It\u2019s waved on by the referee. Could Yates have kept going? We\u2019ll never know.    Updated at 8.03pm GMT    7.41pm    84 min: Surridge, on as sub, is pulled back by Kounate. Liverpool still not finding this at all easy.      7.39pm    83 min: But: a free-kick for Forest, James Garner will take, and the ball is smuggled away by Jota, the match-winner as it stands. Forest are not going to take this lying down.      7.38pm    80 min: Poor Zinckernagel had to watch that from the subs bench as he was replaced by Mighten. Liverpool found a way, with Tsimikas, unable to find a pass all day, releasing the previously quiet Jota. That\u2019s so tough on Forest.      7.37pm   Goal! Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool (Jota, 78)  Tsimikas cuts in, and bends his pass, Jota bends his run and knocks in. There\u2019s a delay for VAR and a hint of offside but that was cruel on Forest. So close to that Zinckernagel miss.    Updated at 7.41pm GMT    7.34pm    76 min: Oh no, that was the one. Lovely ball finds Johnson in space and it\u2019s there to be hit for Zinckernagel. And he does hit it, but wide. Oh no, what a miss.    Updated at 7.41pm GMT    7.31pm    75 min: Van Dijk smashes out of play as Davis threatens him. The gliding Dutchman has not found it easy against the former Villa man. Not at all.      7.30pm    73 min: Oof, the glimmer of a chance as Johnson robs Tsimikas and the ball is there to be crossed. It ends up in Alisson\u2019s arms but Liverpool have lacked a bit of fluency after all those changes, memories of Sven Goran Eriksson swapping out half a team and his teams looking disjointed.      7.28pm    71 min: The sight of Thiago strolling and the no-look pass is amidst us, and mesmeric. Except, his next touch is to almost play in Keinan Davis. That\u2019s a blow to his passing stats.      7.27pm    70 min: Forest are trying to win this in the 90, too. It\u2019s been a fine game despite a lack of goalmouth action. At one end, Luis Diaz makes a pretty theatrical dive and escapes what might have been a yellow.      7.24pm    68 min: Firmino\u2019s pass almost sets up Luis Diaz for a goal with his first touch but the ball runs beyond him. At the other end, Van Dijk has to wake up and stop Brennan Johnson getting a shot in.      7.22pm    66 min: Liverpool\u2019s team looks distinctly stronger with that quartet added. Looks like Jurgen Klopp wants to avoid extra time, it seems.      7.21pm    64 min: Here come four Liverpool subs (count \u2018em).  Oxlade-Chamberlain goes off, looking annoyed, so does Elliott, on come Diaz and Minamo. Thiago replaces Fabinho. Keita off for Henderson.  Forest make one change: off goes Lolley, and on comes Cafu, the Brazilian legend....  Updated at 7.21pm GMT    7.18pm    62 min: Van Dijk and Davis is turning into something of a battle. The Forest forward is a handful.      7.17pm    60 min: Johnson is climbed all over by Gomez. It looked clumsy and it was also deliberate, so Gomez is rightfully booked. A free-kick to be bent in by Garner from the left-hand side? No, it comes to Zinckernagel who can\u2019t beat Alisson\u2019s wingspan.      7.15pm    58 min: Johnathan Kaszynski: \u201cI really feel for Oxlade-Chamberlain. His career was finally coming together and he just hasn\u2019t recovered from that injury. Unfortunately this is not his level anymore.\u201d  It\u2019s true he\u2019s never recovered the form he showed during that 2018 run in the Champions League. And that feels a long time ago now.      7.14pm    57 min: Joe Gomez wins a corner for Liverpool, and Tsimikas takes - of course - Van Dijk hooks it back in, and Horvath clears as Kounate climbs to reach the ball.      7.12pm    55 min: Garner steps up to clear some danger. This tie is on something of an edge. Liverpool have struggled without being anything like overpowered. Forest are seeking that one chance to find a way past.      7.10pm    53 min: A chance soon comes, Jota getting a whiff of one and Horvath saves well, just as he does Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s ball deflects into his path. Liverpool stepping it up now? It seems so.      7.09pm    52 min: Spence forces a corner, and the Forest fans really get behind their men. They get a throw when Tsimikas heads away. Liverpool yet to get into the other half?      7.07pm    50 min: Liverpool try to gain a foothold, they are in danger of being caught like Arsenal at the City Ground where Forest picked up momentum and won the tie.      7.06pm    48 min: An early Forest break sees Johnson try to play in Yates, it results in a free-kick where Davis is caught offside by a well-organised offside trap. Then there\u2019s another offside just as Alisson looks to have fumbled the ball with Keinan Davis lurking. Forest seem to be pushing up and pressing hard.    Updated at 7.10pm GMT    7.02pm    46 min: More Mull of Kintyre and back away we go at the City Ground, can it be as breathless as that first half where no time was added on as the ball was in play for almost the entire 45 minutes.      6.51pm    Here\u2019s the weekend\u2019s FA quarter-final reports. The semi-final draw produced the winner of this tie versus Manchester City and then Chelsea v Crystal Palace.      Updated at 6.51pm GMT    6.47pm   Half-time: Nottingham Forest 0-0 Liverpool  It\u2019s an even contest in that Forest are holding their own and Liverpool are not getting to do anything like they\u2019d want to. The chances have been scrappy, with Forest snatching at a couple on the counter and Liverpool\u2019s best opportunities coming from their opponents\u2019 lapses of concentration.    Updated at 6.49pm GMT    6.45pm    45 min: Tsimikas, clearly assigned the role of dead-ball specialist, makes another mess of one, and it\u2019s cleared easily. Joe Gomez then takes a great deal of time over a throw-in. Liverpool are not at the races at all. And that\u2019s half time.   Updated at 6.46pm GMT    6.43pm    42 min: Jurgen Klopp looks somewhat unamused and bemused. Forest have given as good as they have got and defended like demons...but Gomez gets a chance as Colback, again, slips, but whacks the ball over the bar. Gomez has never scored a goal in professional football.      6.42pm    40 min: A familiar face in the crowd: Forest legend/Manchester United horror story, Garry Birtles, the lad from Long Eaton who was pioneering the bearded look way before the late.2000s hipster, more Bob Grant than Shoreditch thatch.      6.39pm    39 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s turn to put in a weak, very clearable pass, and then foul Brennan Johnson. Not his day just yet, \u201cThe Ox\u201d, one of the least Ox-like players you could imagine.      6.38pm    37 min: Liverpool pressure, plenty of it, but not a great deal of quality in their final ball.      6.37pm    35 min: Tsimikas, to nobody\u2019s surprise, falls over when he\u2019s in a good position on the edge of the Forest box.      6.34pm    33 min: Keita and Oxlade-Chamberlain try to release the ever involved but not quite at it Tsimikas and the ball rolls out. Lolley speeds down the other wing and his ball to Johnson misses the target. Forest\u2019s best hopes rely on those two players down the flanks.      6.32pm    31 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain digs out a pass towards Firmino but Horvath is again quick and safe as he quells the danger.     Updated at 7.02pm GMT    6.30pm    29 min: Oooh, Colback almost plays Firmino in with a backpass but Horvath stands tall and bails out the midfielder, and Worrall completes the job. Soon after that, Tsimikas gets the ball and shoots from distance. His radar is well off at the moment.   Updated at 6.36pm GMT    6.28pm    27 min: Forest break to loud noise, the move started by Lolley before Johnson cuts back and they decide to hold the ball. \u201cWhere\u2019s your famous atmosphere\u201d was sung by the Liverpool fans. It\u2019s here, actually. Deafening.      6.26pm    25 min: All Liverpool now, and Forest doing an awful lot of chasing. Spence gets a rare chance to speed down the other end but a calm, collected Van Dijk comes across and scoops the ball from danger.    Updated at 6.27pm GMT    6.24pm    23 min: Liverpool corner, Tsimikas takes again, and again the ball is cleared. The Greece defender tries another cross and that\u2019s cleared. Virgil van Dijk has to jog back home to central defence having been nowhere near the ball.      6.22pm    22 min: A wildcat attack by Forest with Zinckernagel again providing the final pass. Lolley fires wide and wastefully, plenty of power, not enough direction.      6.21pm    21 min: Forest\u2019s defence has been sat increasingly deep, and held its shape with plenty of cover ahead of them. Liverpool dominating possession now, Forest\u2019s attacks will come on the counter.      6.20pm    19 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain corner, with Fabinho surging into the space but unable to connect. One from the training ground, and one that\u2019s gone to waste. On the touchline, Jurg looks a bit annoyed by that.      6.18pm    17 min: Gomez again cuts in, he\u2019s being given licence to do so, and shoots from distance. Horvath, the American goalie, claims it at the second time of asking but no real danger.   Updated at 6.36pm GMT    6.15pm    15 min: Tsimikas tries one from distance and it dips and swerves just over. Forest speed down the other end. Zinckernagel sets up Yates, who has time to shoot but not enough to prevent a defender coming across to deflect behind. It\u2019s a crisp, competitive cup tie. Joe Garner tries to give it a goal but whacks over the bar.   Updated at 6.15pm GMT    6.13pm    13 min: Gomez does a decent impression of \u201cTrent\u201d in speeding up on the overlap, causing panic as he does but then hitting it behind his teammates. Tsimikas then takes his second corner of the game and it\u2019s even worse than his first. \u201cTrent\u201d and \u201cRobbo\u201d both missed so far by Liverpool.      6.11pm    11 min: Liverpool attempt to play the ball around, try and take the sting from Forest. It eventually comes to Jota, and Worrall steps across for a superb piece of anticipation.      6.09pm    9 min: Hurried clearance by Van Dijk and it needed to be. More Forest pressure as Johnson speeds to the line, Lolley has the goal gaping but chooses to cross. That was a chance to hit the target, one passed up but Liverpool are struggling a little.      6.07pm    7 min: Jurgen Klopp is already up and issuing instructions, Liverpool yet to find their stride. Oxlade-Chamberlain plays the ball for Firmino to chase but it\u2019s overhit. It was a bit hurried, as if he felt under pressure.      6.06pm    5 min: Forest pushing up and in numbers. Steve Cooper hasn\u2019t set his men to defend deep. A cup tie is there to be won, after all.      6.04pm    4 min: A long time since these supporters were singing at each other, and the Liverpool fans are playing their part. An early dart from Johnson, the Forest youngster, and he gets to the right-hand side of the box, his cross going into Alisson\u2019s hands. Him versus Joe Gomez is a contest to watch.      6.02pm    2 min: Liverpool win an early corner, taken by Tsimikas and cleared as Jota lurks. The ball comes back out, and Keita chips the ball through Elliott seems set to score but the offside flag goes up.     6.01pm    1 min: And away we go in the FA Cup quarter-final after the players take the knee. Hell of an atmosphere at the City Ground, very loud indeed.      5.59pm    The pre-match sound of U2\u2019s Beautiful Day ringing out as the teams come out seems apt for a tie being screened on ITV in the UK, if the wrong competition for The Premiership. It\u2019s followed by Welcome To The Jungle. Stadium DJs never play the latest hip sounds, do they? (Not that I\u2019d know what they are, but the playlist always stops around 2004, with only the Killers, Beyonce, Pharrell Williams, Amy Winehouse\u2019s Valerie and Mark Ronson escaping through. Mull of Kintyre rings out at the City Ground now, as is traditional, even if Silly Love Songs is a superior track.      5.46pm    Ian Copestake on that 5-0 game from 1988. \u201cNot only am I one of those fans of a certain age, but I still possess the VHS tape of the drubbing that came out a few months later!\u201d Even as someone with no affinity for either club I must confess I watched that game back many times over and had the tape for a few years myself.  Matt Dony: \u201cForest have got Cafu on the bench? That\u2019s a lot of experience to bring on...\u201d Can still do a job, the lad. This Cafu is a 27-year-old midfielder from Guiamares.   Updated at 5.48pm GMT    5.38pm    So, there will be no Liverpool v Manchester City FA Cup final. Instead, and if Liverpool get past Forest, they can thwart each other\u2019s treble/quadruple bids in the semis.  A prediction, should it happen: at least one of the managers will select a weird team as if to duck the contest. The likes of Ferguson and Wenger used to do that and it\u2019s become quite commonplace since when the rest of us want them to go hell for leather at each other at Wembley.  What that will mean is it could be City v Liverpool on consecutive weekends - first in Premier League on 10 April and then the following weekend. That\u2019s the type of schedule that can heat up a rivalry that\u2019s never quite got to the Fergie/Wenger levels. Klopp and Guardiola are perhaps a little too polite.     Updated at 5.57pm GMT    5.35pm   FA Cup semi-final draw  It\u2019s drawn by Robbie Fowler on ITV Manchester City will play Nottingham Forest/Liverpool Chelsea will play Crystal Palace The ties to be played at Wembley on 16/17 April.      5.33pm    The last time they met in the FA Cup, that fateful day at Hillsborough in 1989, has been remembered in the City Ground today.      5.31pm    And from the Forest side here, that rivalry of the late-70s.       5.29pm    Fans of a certain age will remember this Liverpool v Forest encounter, a high point of Liverpool\u2019s last great era.       5.26pm    The managers speak to ITV.Steve Cooper: \u201cReady as we can be, we have to believe in ourselves. We\u2019ve gone to a back four, I don\u2019t mind saying that, we\u2019ve picked some injuries up but I am believe in the next man up. [On the Hillsborough display put on at the City Ground] The 97 should never be forgotten, and rightly so.\u201d  J\u00fcrgen Klopp: \u201cThey are in the quarter-final for a reason. Home games are useful for them. I think we know what to expect, hope we are ready for it. Robbo is ill, it\u2019s finally got him. Mo felt an injury again. Sadio, they have some massive games coming up. Hopefully it works out.\u201d    Updated at 5.28pm GMT    5.22pm    They may not need \u201cTrent\u201d today but this is a significant absentee for Liverpool, a player replaced by Joe Gomez, who is not the same sort of player at full-back.       5.16pm    Steve Cooper isn\u2019t quite Clough but he\u2019s the latest man entrusted with reviving Forest, and he\u2019s making a decent job of it, having beaten Arsenal and Leicester in this season\u2019s competition. Great profile by Ben Fisher to read here on someone with some history with today\u2019s opponents.   For Cooper, it all started at Wrexham when his manager, Brian Flynn, encouraged the full-back to pursue coaching and he became the club\u2019s head of youth development. In the early days he juggled taking the under-18s at Wrexham with playing part-time for Rhyl, Bangor and The New Saints. By the age of 27, he had his Uefa pro licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Liverpool liked what they saw and appointed Cooper as a youth coach.       5.13pm    One of the reasons the Clough word wasn\u2019t mentioned is that Jonathan Wilson went back there in his Observer column.   The decline of Forest from European champions to top-six challengers in the 80s tends to be put down to Clough\u2019s falling out with Taylor, and that clearly was a major factor, but so, too, were basic issues of finance. Of course mistakes have been made, some of them major, and, of course, things might have been different had different decisions been taken, but Forest\u2019s post-Clough decline has essentially returned them to the status they held before he took over.       5.06pm    Liverpool have made seven changes. Only Alisson, Virgil Van Dijk, Fabinho and Diogo Jota retain their places from the midweek win at Arsenal. Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are omitted from the squad entirely as Harvey Elliott and Roberto Firmino join Jota up front. Nottingham Forest have made just the one change from the team that beat QPR 3-1 in midweek. Joe Lolley replaces Scott McKenna for Forest  Updated at 5.11pm GMT    5.05pm   Here are the teams  Liverpool: Alisson, Gomez, Konate, Van Dijk, Tsimikas, Fabinho, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Elliott, Jota, Firmino. Subs: Adrian, Thiago, Henderson, Jones, Minamino, Diaz, Origi, Matip, Beck.  Nottingham Forest: Hovath, Spence, Figueiredo, Worrall, Colback, Davis, Zinckernagel, Johnson, Yates, Lolley, Garner. Subs: Samba, Mbe Soh, Bong, Laryea, Cafu, Ojeda, Mighten, Silva, Surridge.   Updated at 5.08pm GMT    5.00pm   Preamble  Who will complete the final four of the FA Cup? A tie of historic significance, a trip down memory lane will decide it. It\u2019s not since the last century, 1999, that Forest and Liverpool faced each other and by then the rivalry of the late-1970s/early-1980s and a less heated revival at the end of the 1980s was a distant memory, even if Liverpool were in the doldrums themselves by 1999. The modern Forest are in the hunt for promotion, but their cup run has seized the imagination and the agenda for now. The Liverpool of 2022 are meanwhile going for the type of quadruple that even the teams of the 1980s would have thought beyond their ken. J\u00fcrgen Klopp seems to have decided the cups are worth going for; that wasn\u2019t always the case. The City Ground awaits, a stadium where a visit does conjure memories of glories past, mostly because the place has barely changed in many years. And to draw this preamble to an end, you will notice that we have not actually mentioned his name until the very end: Brian Clough.  Kick-off at 6pm UK time. Join me.   Updated at 5.00pm GMT "

Here were the major developments of the day \u2013 the fifteenth anniversary of the national apology to the Stolen Generations  Anthony Albanese used his speech to argue for the referendum as the next stage in Australia\u2019s reconciliation process. The opposition leader Peter Dutton expressed regret for boycotting the apology as part of his response to the Closing the Gap implementation report, saying he \u201cfailed to grasp the significance\u201d of the day. Foreign minister, Penny Wong, has claimed the former Coalition government \u201cstuffed this market\u201d in a discussion about Australia\u2019s energy system, as she and Senate sparring partner Simon Birmingham took their positions again in estimates. The home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo has issued an apology to the government over the failure to renew the instrument designating Nauru as a regional processing country. Pezzullo said that the Nauru instrument sunsetting was first mentioned in a list in January 2021 of regulations that would lapse, but the department \u201cfailed to monitor and track\u201d it. And Dutton used the start of Question Time to ask the prime minister whether his election commitment to allow people on temporary protection and safe haven visas to apply for permanent residency would lead to an increase in \u201cpeople smuggling arrivals\u201d.      7.38am    Burney tells new cross-parliamentary group of the \u2018magic\u2019 of voice referendum The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, says a yes vote in the voice to parliament referendum would lead to \u201cunifying us in a way that\u2019s never been done before\u201d, urging supporters to back the campaign in a speech to a cross-parliamentary group boosting the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Labor MP Gordon Reid, Liberal MP Bridget Archer and crossbencher Allegra Spender are co-chairs of the new parliamentary Friends of the Uluru Statement group, launched tonight at Parliament House. A wide range of politicians attended, including a large number of Labor MPs but also Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Liberal MP Jenny Ware, and independents Kate Chaney and Helen Haines. Julian Leeser, shadow Indigenous Australians minister, arrived a little later after a shadow cabinet meeting The group heard speeches from Burney, special envoy on the Uluru Statement, Pat Dodson, and yes campaign spokespeople Dean Parkin and Thomas Mayo.  Burney thanked the cross-party group of supporters \u201cfrom the bottom of my heart\u201d.  First Nations people will be recognised in our nation\u2019s birth certificate. And when that happens, imagine the Sunday morning after a successful referendum. We\u2019ll probably wake up very early and feel very different, because this country will be different. It will be a nation that has finally recognised, it will be a nation where everyone will feel part of that change. That\u2019s the magic of this referendum.  Dodson said he believed Australians had \u201ca knack for being generous and transformative when it counts\u201d in big moments. \u201cWe\u2019re faced with another big moment. I\u2019ve seen a few moments come and go and be lost,\u201d he said, calling the Uluru statement and the voice concept \u201cgenerous\u201d. Spender said she experienced \u201cshivers\u201d when hearing the Uluru Statement read aloud. Archer said it was \u201can easy yes\u201d for her to accept a co-chair position with the group, saying it was \u201cincumbent\u201d on MPs to meet the Uluru Statement \u201cin the spirit it\u2019s given\u201d.  I commit to walking with you to hopefully a brighter future this year.  The Liberal party is still to commit to a party room position on the voice. In a speech today, Opposition leader Peter Dutton said those questioning the Indigenous voice to parliament were \u201cnot hardhearted\u201d.   Updated at 7.52am GMT    7.33am    Meanwhile, the ABC has been experiencing major outages on its websites and apps this evening, including iView. The sites appear to be back up and running now.    Updated at 7.40am GMT    7.22am    Bureau cancels cyclone warning for Gulf of Carpentaria The Bureau of Meteorology has cancelled a tropical cyclone watch in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The BoM:  Over the next few days, the monsoon trough extends across the top end and Gulf of Carpentaria, with a low embedded in the trough near Groote Eylandt. A severe weather warning for damaging wind and heavy rainfall has been issued for the eastern top end, including Groote Eylandt. The Northern Territory emergency service are urging everyone in the affected areas to stay away from flooded drains, rivers, streams and waterways and not to drive into floodwaters.   Updated at 7.24am GMT    7.09am    On this day fifteen years ago \u2013 a rare bipartisan moment when Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke were still with us. It\u2019s also a pertinent reminder that a commitment to treaty for First Nations people was first promised by a prime minister back in 1988, when Hawke received The Barunga Statement from Aboriginal elders. More than three decades later, no leader on either side of politics has succeeded.   Updated at 7.22am GMT    7.01am    Independent MP backs government decision on TPVs  Independent MP Zoe Daniels appeared on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing earlier discussing topics of the day, including the federal government\u2019s fulfillment of its election promise on temporary protection visas (TPVs). She said Australia was on the \u201cright side of history\u201d.  It is important because members of my community and all the other crossbench communities have been coming into our offices saying please help on this issue of TPVs and shared visas and they are saying: what is the story? Am I eligible for this new one and how long will that take and how is it going to work? My understanding is that those whose visas are soon to come up for renewal will be prioritised at the front of the queue, and so others might have to wait a few weeks. The surveys show 75% of Australians want more humane treatment of these people. So I think we are on the right side of history there.  The decision, affecting around 19,000 people, results from years of advocacy by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. Its director Jana Favero appeared before Daniels, describing the events as an \u201cemotional day\u201d for people waiting over a decade in legal limbo.  We cannot underestimate how significant this is, and that people are finally able to rebuild their lives, finally call Australia home and most importantly finally able to start that pathway to family reunion. It won\u2019t happen overnight, it is a process \u2026 because it is coming on top of ten years of being denied that family reunion. So yes, it will take time but today we really just want to have a celebration of joy for those 19,000 people who have great news that has been much awaited.   Updated at 7.11am GMT    6.43am    Tragic end in search for missing man In Queensland, police have located the body of a 49-year-old man who was reported missing in Lake Tinaroo. The man was found shortly before 3.30pm within the search area where he went missing while swimming yesterday in the Tablelands. Emergency services were called to Church Street just after 11am on Sunday to reports that a man had gone missing in the lake. Police say the man was assisting two children return to shore when he failed to resurface. The children were assessed by paramedics on scene, and were uninjured. Police will prepare a report for the coroner, however there are not considered to be any suspicious circumstances.  Updated at 6.51am GMT    6.34am    Meanwhile, back in Canberra:    Updated at 6.44am GMT    6.24am    Depth of Snowy 2.0\u2019s \u2018surface depression\u2019 as much as 70m  As we flagged earlier today, Snowy Hydro was due up in senate estimates today, with a grilling about its latest delay likely. One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts (like us) was keen to know about the hole, dubbed by Snowy as a \u201csurface depression\u201d at a key tunnelling site at its giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project near Lake Tantangara. Former acting boss, Roger Whitby conceded that \u201cnot a great deal of distance\u201d had been drilled by the huge tunnel boring machine (dubbed \u201cFlorence\u201d) in the past three months. Actually, it has lately been stalled, as Snowy told us last week. In fact, the distance between the tunnel and the hole to the surface is in the order of 50-70m, Whitby said. Roberts, who was once into mining himself, acknowledged that such a connection was no small thing, as he wrapped up his questions. Snowy is working through the issues \u201cclosely\u201d so that Florence is no longer bogged, Whitby said. We may find out a bit more later about what it\u2019s going to take to un-bog the borer.  Updated at 6.43am GMT    6.13am    Burney urges Coalition to \u2018embrace the voice\u2019 Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, spoke with Dana Morse on the ABC this afternoon on the fifteen-year anniversary of the Apology to the Stolen Generations. Asked about a \u201cpretty pointed comment\u201d by opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who didn\u2019t attend the breakfast for the Apology this morning \u2013 despite conceding he made the wrong decision to not be in the chamber when it occurred \u2013 Burney said it was a \u201cmistake\u201d Dutton didn\u2019t attend.  There were 400 people there and the prime minister made it, so I can\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t have made it. He spoke in the chamber today about the mistake that he made 15 years ago, and that\u2019s a good thing that he made that clear. But at the end of the day, he didn\u2019t go, and he has an opportunity now to support the voice, and let\u2019s hope he takes it. I am urging the Coalition, the Liberal party, to embrace the voice as many, many, many Australians have, and to not use this as a political football. This is above politics, this is about the Australian people.   Updated at 6.28am GMT    6.05am    Tehan criticises government decision on TPVs Shadow immigration minister Dan Tehan appeared on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing following question time today, reflecting on the federal government\u2019s decision to allow around 19,000 people on temporary protection and safe haven visas to seek permanent residency.  Do you acknowledge that this is the fulfilment of a commitment, and should not come as any surprise to anyone?  Tehan said the Coalition wanted to see \u201cfull disclosure\u201d on whether the decision to take the individuals out of legal limbo would \u201clead to the boats starting again\u201d.  The current prime minister stood beside Kevin Rudd, the then prime minister and said that these people would not settle in Australia. Now here we have them changing their mind. The problem is that all this will be sent to the people smugglers, and they will be thinking about OK, how are we going to test the wheel of the government \u2026 that\u2019s why that advice is so important.  Asked if going out and touting the return of the boats was actually running the risk of encouraging the actions he was discouraging, he replied, \u201cwe want to be \u2026 very clear that no one wants to see the 1,200 people drowning at sea\u201d.   Updated at 6.16am GMT    5.56am    Many thanks to Amy Remeikis for keeping us abreast of another big news day. I\u2019ll be with you for the next little while.     5.54am    Caitlin Cassidy is going to take you through the evening. And Murph, Josh, Paul and Daniel are still working on stories, so make sure you check back for those, as well as everything else the Guardian brainstrust is putting together. Thank you to everyone who read today, and for your time below the line \u2013as well as your messages. For those who asked questions, I\u2019ll get back to you this evening. I will be back on for Politics Live early tomorrow morning \u2013 but until then, please, take care of you.     5.52am    Bill Shorten takes opportunity to lambast previous government on robodebt  Just needed to wait for the transcript of this one, but for those asking, here is what Bill Shorten, minister for government services, was asked during QT. (Shorten has been taking dixers on robodebt to provide updates on the royal commission) Q: What has the royal commission into robodebt uncovered in relation to warnings of the i scheme\u2019s unlawfulness? Shorten:  Madeleine Masterton appeared as a witness to the royal commission with Victorian Legal Aid on the 31st of October last year. For the record, she\u2019s a clinical research nurse, a credentialed diabetes educator. She\u2019s obtained a Master of Nursing Society, University of Melbourne, a Bachelor of Arts, University of Western Australia, a grad certificate in Diabetes Education, Deakin University. She worked part time during attaining these degrees and intermittently received modest Centrelink payments. She\u2019s also, although it doesn\u2019t go on her CV, a victim of the previous government\u2019s unlawful robodebt scheme. She received her illegal robodebt letter in mid-2018. She eventually rang Victorian Legal Aid, who supported her in an action against the government. To stop her, on the 27th of March 2019 the government received the Masterton Advice, Exhibit 21731, which I hold in my hand. Now this advice only came to light because of the royal commission. Senate inquiries were unable to get this advice. It\u2019s another example that without the royal commission, which those opposite oppose, we wouldn\u2019t know what I\u2019m about to tell you. The advice said the applicant would have good prospects of succeeding in a claim for relief on the basis the use of the apportioned ATO data will not establish that she owed a debt under the Act. Now, magically, as happened on 76 other occasions, the government recalculated the debt down to zero when someone took them to court. But the Masterton case had wider-ranging implications for the scheme as a whole. The advice further notes, and I quote: \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the above our analysis suggests that there are wider legal risks involved in the Commonwealth solely using apportioned data to determine whether a debt is owed to the Commonwealth in relation to the payment of social security depending on a fortnightly income test.\u201d The government were told, the former Coalition government were told unequivocally, you\u2019ve got a problem with this scheme. They were unequivocally told on many occasions, but in this case with the Masterton advice which the government, the former government, did not want us to see, it spells it out, spelled it out in March of 2019, 240 days before the member for Fadden, just about the last of the robodebt ministers still here, took any action on it. What\u2019s remarkable about Madeleine Masterton, she didn\u2019t want to be the subject of these issues. But she does say this at the close of her statement - the outcome of the class action is not compensation for the meals skipped, school trips foregone, the stress and fear and despair that some families, individuals no doubt experienced. She says, and I think she speaks for all of Australia: \u201cI would like to hear remorse from the robodebt architects for causing such harm.\u201d  Those opposite knew and they did nothing about it for four-and-a-half years.   Updated at 6.11am GMT    5.48am   Perth HQ of Woodside defaced in protest over Burrup development  A West Australian musician has defaced the Perth headquarters of fossil fuel giant Woodside, in protest over the alleged destruction of ancient First Nations art in the Burrup peninsula. Protester Trent Rojahn used a fire extinguisher filled with yellow paint to coat the glass frontage of the Mount Street headquarters, then used spray cans of paint to write the slogan \u201cDisrupt Burrup Hub\u201d, \u201cFuck Woodside\u201d and \u201cSix billion tonnes\u201d on the building\u2019s front doors. The incident took place at 9.30am local time on Monday. Police arrived shortly after and handed Rojahn a move-on notice. No charges have yet been laid. The action comes just three days after the Australian government nominated the Murujuga rock art \u2013 situated in the area where Woodside operates gas and fertiliser plants \u2013 for Unesco world heritage status. Prior to the protest, Rojahn released a statement saying the yellow paint represented Burrup Hub\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. There are more than one million rock art paintings on the peninsula with some thought to be 50,000 years old. The protest group Disrupt Burrup Hub took responsibility for the incident, saying in a statement that the rock art faced \u201ctotal destruction within decades\u201d if Woodside did not cease its operations in the area. A spokesperson for Woodside said the incident was now a police matter and referred the Guardian to WA Police. \u201cWoodside respects people\u2019s rights to protest lawfully and supports constructive engagement on all issues of importance to the communities where we live and work,\u201d a Woodside statement said. This is the second protest against Woodside from the group this year. In January, Perth artist Joana Partyka sprayed the Woodside logo in yellow paint on Frederick McCubbin\u2019s colonial masterpiece Down on His Luck, held in the Art Gallery of WA \u2013 a protest subsequently endorsed by McCubbin\u2019s descendants. On Friday, Partyka pled guilty to criminal damage and was ordered to pay $7,500 in fines and costs.   Updated at 6.56am GMT    5.37am    That \u2018conversation\u2019 continued: Watt: I know you\u2019re here to hold a torch for that. Antic:  No, no, no, no, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here to pick out extraordinary statements like the Department of Home Affairs has got time in between, well, cybersecurity and other anti-terrorism. Which one minister? Which one do you think is, on a hierarchy of priorities, which one would you pick? \u2026 Well, look, I guess the original question was: is this parody? Is this a joke? And the answer, well, no one\u2019s no one\u2019s asking you. We\u2019ve already heard some \u2026   Watt:  There\u2019s multiple questions. But senator Antic, the whole reason that the National Emergency Management Agency was here earlier this morning, is that it sits within the Home Affairs Department. And that is based on the decision of this government that climate-induced natural disasters, which the overwhelming majority of scientists tell us \u2026  Antic:  Could you point to one?  Watt  ... are going to increase, are a threat to our country. And that means that just as the Home Affairs Department is the correct agency to be considering the potential impact of cyber attacks on our country or terrorism attacks on our country. This is a threat to our country that is appropriately dealt with by Home Affairs.  Antic:  One last question. Thank you for that, I appreciate that glowing clarification. Well Mr Pezzullo is it safe to say that the department has been captured by leftist ideology?  Watt: (laughing) I\u2019m looking forward to hearing this answer. Pezzullo:  Chair, I would seek some guidance from you. My understanding is that I\u2019m here to explain our performance and the expenditure of public monies. I\u2019m really, I don\u2019t even know where to start.  Antic:  Just start with a yes or no. \u2026 It was a serious question. Because I find that extraordinary.  Watt: That\u2019s your assertion. Antic:  Whether it\u2019s my assertion or not, I think the Australian people would be find it extraordinary that the Department of Home Affairs is, is spending time away from cybersecurity, counterterrorism \u2026  Pezzullo:  I can assure you that we\u2019re not.  Antic:  So, do you want to just answer that question?  Pezzullo:  Well, on the presumption that it wasn\u2019t a rhetorical question.  Antic:  No, it\u2019s not a rhetorical question. It was not a waste of time. It\u2019s a reasonable question. I know that the left in this building think that everything relates to their issues. That\u2019s not the case. The average Australians don\u2019t think that. They\u2019re worried about real issues.  Pezzullo:  Thank you for clarifying that your question to me was not rhetorical. We are captured by nothing other than the public interest. We serve the public interest under the Public Service Act. We serve the government of the day and we faithfully execute impartially and apolitically its policies. Thank you.  Antic:  Lovely summary statement.  Greens senator Nick McKim gets the call: Pezzullo:  Please don\u2019t ask me if I\u2019ve been captured by leftists again.  Watt:  He will ask if you\u2019ve been captured by rightwing extremists.  McKim:  No I won\u2019t. I already know the answer.   Updated at 5.50am GMT    5.30am    Senators Antic and Pezzullo go head to head To those watching estimates \u2026 we salute you! Here is Liberal senator Alex Antic being very serious and taking everything very seriously, in estimates today: Antic:  Thanks, chair. I do I just have a couple of quick questions about \u2026 Mr Pezzullo, your opening statement here, which I have in front of me, you made mention of the fact that the department\u2019s work extends to dealing with the effects of climate change.  Pezzullo: Yes. Antic:  And to better position Australia to deal with the increasing exposure and vulnerabilities to nationally significant crises, including those due to climate change. With the greatest of respect \u2013 is that comedy? Parody? Or is that serious?  Pezzullo: I\u2019m not, are you referring to a question that you\u2019ve asked me? I don\u2019t understand. Antic:  No, no, no, the suggestion that the Department of Home Affairs is somehow prioritising the issue of climate change. Is that a serious \u2026?  Pezzullo:  I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, the increasing frequency and severity of weather events were responsible in supporting the Minister for Emergency Management, who happens to be at the table, with policy and legislative advice. My colleague, the coordinator general of NEMA (The National Emergency Management Agency), that was questioned this morning then delivers programs. I genuinely don\u2019t know how to respond to a rather oddly put question. You asked me whether it\u2019s comedy. It\u2019s my job. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t really understand what you\u2019re asking me?  Antic:  Well, so you\u2019re meaning to tell me that the Department of Home Affairs is prioritising the effects of climate change?  Pezzullo: When you say prioritising, it\u2019s one of the things we work on.  Antic: It\u2019s clearly a priority. So where would you put climate? Where would you put climate change in amongst the following? Counter terrorism, cybersecurity, migration visas, refugee humanitarian statements?  Pezzullo: I mean, I balance my work, the resources that government affords me across all of the national risks that we assist the government in managing. Antic:  And what role does the Department of Home Affairs play in in respect of climate change.  Pezzullo:  So we\u2019re running the national resilience taskforce, which was set up after the election, which is looking at both security as well as climate-induced national resilience challenges, which can extend from one end of the spectrum \u2013 to natural disasters and the impact on communities of frequent more persistent and more severe weather events \u2013 right through to supply-chain blockages and the issues that might arise in relation to the global access that we have to markets as a result of conflict. And you\u2019re seeing that play out, for instance, in the Ukraine war with Russia\u2019s illegal invasion, right through to what might happen in terms of impact on our critical national infrastructure where we were the subject of cyber attacks.  Antic:  So you say that human-induced climate change is, is somehow a credible threat to Australia\u2019s home affairs? It is the contention?  Pezzullo:  I think it\u2019s a credible threat to Australia and where the Home Affairs Department is.  Antic:  Does the department take a view that that climate change is human induced?  Pezzullo: Yes. Antic:  Does it really?  Labor senator Murray Watt: Most scientists do. Antic:  Do they? Most scientists? That\u2019s a false statement. (ed note: it is not)    Updated at 5.44am GMT    5.19am    Interesting disclosures in the Senate Further to an earlier post about senators\u2019 disclosures of interests, it seems that a few people in the upper house have made some errors recently \u2013 glass houses and all that. If you\u2019ll remember, Labor senator Jana Stewart gave Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie some stick for disclosing that she received Australian Open tennis tickets in January 2022 without disclosing who gave them to her, prompting the Labor senator to muse whether this was a breach of rules requiring quick disclosures and useful detail. Liberal senator Richard Colbeck hit back with criticism that sports minister Anika Wells hadn\u2019t disclosed some events she attended at the end of 2022. After an afternoon tea break in the finance and public admin hearing in Senate estimates, Colbeck came back with an addendum - McKenzie had updated her register again this afternoon, and said that the January 2022 tennis tickets were actually gifted in 2023, so she\u2019d made a mistake and her disclosure didn\u2019t fall foul of the timing rules. The Nationals senator has also updated her register to note the tickets came from Hancock Prospecting. McKenzie also added more details to other disclosures that she got cricket tickets from Westpac and Cricket Australia, and other tennis tickets from Tennis Australia. Wells, too, has updated her form. The sports minister noted she got FIFA World Cup tickets from FIFA, AFL women\u2019s grand final tickets from the AFL, cricket tickets from Cricket Australia, and accommodation in Qatar for herself and two staff (for four nights) from the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Updated at 5.26am GMT    4.52am    \u2018We have no plans\u2019 (for privatisation): Perrottet New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has refused to rule out further privatisation if the Coalition is re-elected in March. As the government sought to launch an attack on Labor\u2019s plan to remove a controversial public sector wages cap on Monday by insisting it would put major infrastructure projects at risk and add to the state\u2019s growing budget deficit, Perrottet was forced to address his own plans for future sales of public assets. Despite treasurer, Matt Kean, last week appearing to rule out selling off public assets, the premier on Monday would only say the government had \u201cno plans\u201d for privatisation. Asked about the difference in his own response to Kean\u2019s, Perrottet said:  I\u2019m not getting to semantic word games. I\u2019ve made it very clear. We have no plans. What we have is a long term economic strategy to keep NSW moving forward that has been our approach, it\u2019s a balanced approach to financial management in our state, a combination of affordable and sustainable debt position, asset recycling, lower taxes. That ensures the budget remains in a strong position, and we can continue to invest in the things that matter to people across our state.\u201d  Labor has campaigned on a promise to scrap the government cap on public sector wages, while also banning future privatisations. On Monday, Perrottet held a lengthy press conference with Kean in which he presented treasury analysis which he said showed wage rises in line with inflation would cause an $8.6bn hit to the state budget. The analysis \u2013 was also printed on the front page of Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph on Monday \u2013 is based on the assumption that all public sector workers would receive a 7% pay increase in the 2023-24 financial year. Labor has not said it would increase wages in line with inflation.   Updated at 5.14am GMT    4.52am    Greens senator Nick McKim had the next question and Murray Watt (the minister representing the minister for home affairs) quipped something along the lines of whether he would be asking if the department had been captured by rightwing ideology. McKim said he knew the answer to that already.  Updated at 5.13am GMT    4.46am    Australia gets 76 senators and this is one of them      4.44am    Albanese to host prime minister of Vanuatu this week Anthony Albanese will have another guest this week \u2013 the prime minister of Vanuatu, the Honourable Alatoi Ishmael Kalsakau, and Madame Ellene Kalsakau will be visiting Australia from the 14th to the 16th. It\u2019s the first time a prime minister from the republic of Vanuatu has visited since 2018. Prime minister Kalsakau will be accompanied by a delegation including minister of tourism, trade, industry, commerce and Ni Vanuatu business development, Matai Seremaiah, and minister of agriculture, livestock, forestry, fisheries and biosecurity, Nakou Natuman.And yes, climate will be on the agenda.   Updated at 4.59am GMT    4.40am   Coalition \u2018stuffed\u2019 the energy market, Wong says  Foreign minister, Penny Wong, has claimed the former Coalition government \u201cstuffed this market\u201d in a discussion about Australia\u2019s energy system, as she and Senate sparring partner Simon Birmingham took their positions again in estimates. The finance and public administration hearing has finally turned to officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, arriving there a few hours late after the morning\u2019s witnesses ran well over time. Birmingham, the shadow foreign minister and former Senate leader, came in off the long run with a series of questions about freedom of information requests for the PM\u2019s diary, feedback on the \u201cvalues based capitalism\u201d essay from the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the government\u2019s December plan to address supply and price issues in the energy market. Wong called the opposition\u2019s criticism of Chalmers\u2019 essay \u201chysterical\u201d, with Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet officials saying they didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d received any feedback on it. As Birmingham asked about the government\u2019s interventions in the energy sector, by putting price caps on coal and gas, Wong shot back \u201cyou stuffed this market!\u201d  Our position is affordable supply. It might not be yours,\u201d she said.  We didn\u2019t really get any updates on FOI requests for Anthony Albanese\u2019s diary, as Birmingham noted numerous requests for that information from journalists and others.  Updated at 5.00am GMT    4.39am    Anthony Albanese stayed in the chamber for Russell Broadbent\u2019s statement. He adds at the end:  On behalf of the government, I congratulate the member for Monash on his contribution here.  Not just in that speech, but over a long period of time.  The member is a sincere representative of his local community.  He\u2019s someone who has demonstrated across a range of issues his compassion for his fellow Australians, and today he has once again brought great honour to this chamber.       4.38am    Russell Broadbent:  Reflecting on the 40th anniversary of the Ash Wednesday fires, at staging point Akoonah Park, Beaconsfield my truck was stopped and told to stand aside by the district group officer until the wind change passed. Two trucks in front of mine, Panton Hills and the Narre Warren trucks were on into the ridge to protect upper Beaconsfield. All crew perished in the ensuing inferno. Back at the Pakenham station, my father-in-law, the brigade captain NN Webster, took the mayday call. He was never the same. None of us were. This I know of that time \u2013 when the blood of the victims, the ash of the forests, and the sweat of those facing the foe, when drowned in our tears, new life did spring forward. But until the day came in the new dawn, when the sun would rise again over the southern hills of the Great Dividing Range to a clear smokeless sky, we had work to do. Men, women and children to care for. Fires to suppress and communities to rebuild. But most of all, Mr Speaker, most of all, we had a lot of grieving to do. A lot of grieving to do. And grieve we did. Arm in arm, hand in hand, tear drop by blood-filled teardrop. Here\u2019s to you, fireman, Sam, and all who traveled with you.   Updated at 4.46am GMT    4.29am    Question ends. Three more to go this week. Russell Broadbent is giving a statement on indulgence      4.23am    And what do you know \u2013 question time is STILL going. Anthony Albanese seems to want to drag out the torture for all of us lately for reasons known only to him, and I assume, Toto.     4.16am    The Liberal MP for O\u2019Connor, Rick Wilson, has a question for Amanda Rishworth:  In question time last week, the minister responded to a question from my friend, the member for Durack, and informed the House that the antisocial behaviour being experienced in the former Cashless Debit Card site in the Kimberley was due to catastrophic flooding in the region. In the Goldfield electorate, there has been no flooding. Can the minister explain why there has been increased harm as participants come off the Cashless Debit Card trial in my region?  Rishworth:  I thank the member for his question because, of course, those opposite continue their ideological love of the Cashless Debit Card. When there was evidence after evidence that it was not making a difference. When it comes to the Goldfields area, I am aware that the shire of Leonora has reported an increase in antisocial behaviour in their community, including an increase of hospital visitations, which has been attributed to an increase of people coming to the community from the NG Lands, noting that these lands were never in the Cashless Debit boundaries. So, to suggest that somehow that the influx of people from areas outside the Cashless Debit Card site is somehow linked to the removal of this card is disingenuous and wrong. I also understand that the towns of Laverton and Kambalda have also had an increase in antisocial behaviour which, has been linked to the population influx which, of course, is not unusual for this time of year. And that most of the increase were from people from areas that were never in the Cashless Debit boundaries. Across the region, in response to this population influx that happens at this time of the year, the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder has implemented its Summer Response Strategy, which has seen several return-to-country trips taking place to help those who have come into town and unable to get back home. I know that the Summer Response Strategy is also including...  Michael Sukkar pretends to have a point of order:  Mr Speaker, point of order on relevance. The minister is running out of alibis very quickly.  Milton Dick has had enough:  The member for Deakin has been continually disrupting question time today. He\u2019s had multiple warnings and now he\u2019s disrespected the chamber with abuse of standing orders. He will leave the chamber under 94(a). \u2026 That will be the final warning with someone abusing standing orders. It has been continually happening. Question time will not occur with that behaviour.  Rishworth:  Thank you, Speaker. I was updating the House on the Summer Response Strategy, which has been ensuring that people in the Goldfields region are able to get back home to country. And this also includes the wrap-around supports that these people need. Of course, the coalition continues to try and draw a desperate link to anything to do with the Cashless Debit Card. And, of course, we heard it in the chamber today, with the member for Riverina somehow suggesting that income support has been abolished in the Northern Territory. This is simply not the case. But while those opposite continue to deliver misinformation and confusion around the country, our government will continue to do the things that work, provide the support that works, that helps people within communities.   Updated at 4.23am GMT    4.08am    Darren Chester is back on the front bench and has a question for Anthony Albanese: My question is to the prime minister and I refer to the reports from the St Vincent De Paul Society showing combined gas and electricity bills for the average household have soared past $4,000 in Victoria, including in Gippsland, and average household gas bills will increase by $675, or 45%, this year. Why have these households still not seen any relief? Prime minister, why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? Albanese: I thank the member for Gippsland for his question and I congratulate him on his re-elevation back to the frontbench. Now, I\u2019m not sure if the member for Gippsland was here in December because he did represent Australia very well with the member for Dunkley, I know, at the United Nations. And he wants to go back, Mr Speaker! Mr Speaker. And if I sat with a mob who voted against cheaper prices, I\u2019d want to go back too. I\u2019d want to go back too, Mr Speaker. But this is what the Reserve Bank of Australia put out last week about gas prices. \u2018Wholesale electricity and gas prices decline in response to the announcement of the temporary price caps on domestic gas and thermal coal and energy price relief plan on 9 December 2022. Futures markets now suggest that wholesale electricity and gas prices will be lower in 2023 and 2024 than previously expected.\u2019 That is exactly, exactly what the Reserve Bank of Australia said last year. It\u2019s a pity that those opposite voted against, voted against that measure.  Updated at 4.16am GMT    4.05am    Independent MP Dr Sophie Scamps has a question for \u2026 Ed Husic: My question is to the industry and science minister. It has become all too common to undermine the very foundations of our democracy. The National Reconstruction fund bill poses the establishment of a board that will oversee the disbursement of $15bn \u2013 the relevant ministers are set to appoint all the board members themselves. How can the minister assure the Australian people that this board will be truly independent of government? Husic, with a rare non-dixer question to answer says:  I just want to thank the member for Mackellar. I appreciate not only the question but for the entire crossbench, if I may say, the constructive way in which you have worked with us on this. We think this is a moment for nation building. The National Reconstruction fund is a significant investment in capability and we want people to feel like they\u2019ve got a part to play in setting this up for the longer term because it will be important for the economy and for communities well into the future so it is important to be able to take those. We\u2019re not going agree on everything, obviously, but people expect the parliament will work collaboratively which is exactly what is happening from there. Not from here (the opposition) but certainly from there.    If I may say to the member for Mackellar, there are two big motivations in terms of setting the fund up. One was obviously to attend to those supply chain issues and to learn the lessons from the pandemic \u2013not to say we have picked those lessons up and then do nothing afterwards rather rebuild capability in those priority areas. The second thing, member for Mackellar, that we wanted to ensure that what we saw in the last term of parliament, huge amounts of money be allocated not in the national interest but in political interest [didn\u2019t happen] You saw the grants, you saw the rorts, we were all shocked by that and we wanted to do better stop so this is why we announced and particularly the prime minister, when this was announced in March last year, emphasise the independence of the board. That these decisions would be made in a way that would be independent of political decision-making and that you would have people of capability making it. And if I could go to the heart of your question, we want to make sure that all the investment decisions will be solely made by the board and in terms of the composition that you referred to, the legislation has listed skills that we think the two responsible ministers- myself and the Minister for Finance, have to have regard to in making the appointments. Experience in things like banking and finance, venture capital. Private equity. Economics industry policy, have that industrial background that is really important. And just like the successful CSC opposed by those opposite, we want to make sure that the NRF operates along those lines where decisions made in the national interest, not a colour-coded spreadsheet inside. Not the way they made them. We want to make sure that these decisions get made in the national interest for the longer term benefit of the country, rebuilding manufacturing, creating jobs. Unlike those opposite, no to jobs, no to manufacturing, no to regional opportunity.   Updated at 4.21am GMT    3.56am    The Liberal MP for Hughes, Jenny Ware, has a question:  When the government passed its energy market intervention it promised direct relief to the energy bills of millions of Australians. Three months later, nothing has been delivered and last Friday, the New South Wales government said it is yet to receive the support it was promised from the Albanese government\u2026  There is so much noise, Milton Dick has to ask for silence before she finishes and the last line is\u2026  Prime minister, why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?  Anthony Albanese:  I thank the member for Hughes for her question. It goes to two issues. One issue is the attitude of the New South Wales government towards our planet past the parliament in December and the second is what about relief? The member for Hughes was amongst those who voted against the $1.5m, voted against it. Never, ever to be received. And when it comes to the New South Wales government, the New South Wales treasurer and energy minister said this \u2013 we are not on the side of energy bosses, we are on the side of consumers and businesses. Who was he talking about was on the side of energy bosses? Those opposite who voted against the plan, voted against price caps and already had an impact on prices as was identified last week.   Updated at 4.08am GMT    3.52am    Stephen Bates, who is still haunting the pro-tie brigade of parliament by proudly freeing his collar, has a question for the treasurer:  People in my electorate of Brisbane are struggling to see a doctor as the number of bulk-billing GPs in my community plummets. Treasurer, will you scrap the $250bn stage-three tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, including politicians and pretty much everyone in this room, and assist people with real cost-of-living relief such boosting GP bulk-billing payments and bringing dental into Medicare?  Jim Chalmers:  As the member knows, the government\u2019s position on stage-three tax cuts hasn\u2019t changed. But what we will do is we will pick up and run with the two other suggestions central to his question. I want to commend the minister for health for the work that he is doing in our cabinet and in our government to do whatever we can to strengthen Medicare. We understand that primary healthcare is in the worst nick that it\u2019s been in since Medicare came in 40 years ago. And so a lot of the government\u2019s efforts, a lot of the government\u2019s time, a lot of the government\u2019s resources is working under the leadership of the minister for health to strengthen Medicare and strengthen healthcare in this country. And as we have said before, we have already set aside substantial funds for that task, and if there\u2019s more that we can responsibly do in in area, obviously we will consider doing it. And when it comes to the rest of the member\u2019s question about cost-of-living relief, you know, we understand that Australians, whether it be in Brisbane in your part of the world, or right around the country, people are under pressure. And that\u2019s why a central part of our three-point plan to address inflation is relief, cost-of-living relief for people doing it tough, whether it be their energy bills, whether it be their medicines, whether it be early childhood education, whether it be fee-free Tafe, whether it gets wages moving again - these are all essential parts of the government\u2019s work to try and put downward pressure on inflation because people are faring, it\u2019s very difficult for people in the economy right now when we\u2019ve got these cost-of-living pressures coming at us from around the world but felt around the kitchen table. And so this government will work with anyone in this country and on the crossbench to deliver responsible cost-of-living relief as part of that three-point plan. Relief from cost-of-living pressures, repair our supply chains, and show restraint in the budget so that we can deliver some of these priorities in the most responsible way.  In case you missed it, Murph\u2019s podcast with the prime minister also addresses this question on stage-three tax cuts. It is towards the end \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t give a lot of hope for people holding out for a change on this.   Updated at 4.02am GMT    3.49am    David Littleproud has to ask this question twice because there are so many interjections as he gets about into the second half of it:  I refer to Labor\u2019s first round of the Mobile Phone Black Spots Program, opened this month in 54 target locations. Why is it that 74% of these target locations are in Labor Party-held electorates? How is this fair and accountable for bushfire-prone communities across regional Australia, desperate for better mobile coverage?  Anthony Albanese:  Well, I will ask that the minister for communications to add to the answer, but I should give credit where credit is due to the minister for energy, who suggested I should give you both Barilaros on that question (there is much laugher and Milton Dick calls them to order)    Because, frankly, frankly, to the leader of the National Party, to come in here and ask a question about pork-barrelling\u2026 \u2026When the fund that was half funded by the federal government and half-funded by the New South Wales government, when the leader of the National party in New South Wales sat down and changed the rules and changed the guidelines, so that the bushfire-affected communities in the electorate of Macquarie got money taken away from them, and they looked at the colour-coded map to exclude [Labor electorates]\u2026 What a disgrace from the National Party. The party of sports rorts. The party of community [pool] rorts. The party\u2026 I walk Toto sometimes... (Toto is his dog)  At this point, Paul Fletcher has a point of order on relevance and Dick tells Albanese to get on with it: Albanese:  But the extraordinary gall of the leader of the National Party to ask this question, I mean, you know, I sometimes \u2026 When you go for a walk near the Sydney Harbour Bridge, past North Sydney Pool, you pass a project that was funded under the regional scheme because some people from the country might swim in it sometimes! You have got to be kidding. The rounds, of course, that we did are about election commitments that were made. That were made and now they\u2019re open. That\u2019s what occurs. That\u2019s what occurs. That is why it\u2019s happened in this way. But for the leader of the National Party, who I know is embarrassed by the performance of the New South Wales Nats, to ask this question is just extraordinary.  (There is no time left for Michelle Rowland to answer)  Updated at 3.58am GMT    3.42am    Paul Fletcher did have a point of order on relevance on that last dixer that Bowen took though:  I will concede it was a tightly drafted question. How is this program helping Australia\u2019s status as a renewable energy superpower? How has it been received? How has it built on existing achievements? Absolutely nothing about, \u201cWould the minister please give his usual incoherent spray...?\u201d  So things are going really, really well.     3.37am    Chris Bowen joins in on the national reconstruction fund dixer-palooza, and you have to wonder \u2013 who is any of this aimed at? The opposition aren\u2019t going to change their mind based on a dixer blow out, and it is not as though Australians watch question time as a general rule. In terms of social media posts, it is not exactly engaging content. But we continue.  Updated at 3.46am GMT    3.35am    Angus Taylor has another question for Anthony Albanese, which brings the by now, rote groans, because it\u2019s not a question for Jim Chalmers (Taylor doesn\u2019t ask Chalmers questions is the \u2018joke\u2019).  Taylor:  In May last year, in response to a single rate rise, the prime minister said Australians were facing a full-blown cost of living crisis. Given that the RBA has lifted rates eight times since May, will the prime minister now accept responsibility for a cost of living crisis on his watch? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?  Albanese:  I agree with the bloke who said it is clear the world has changed dramatically, even in the past few months was to we have seen a rapid shift to an inflationary environment. He said that in September. I agree with my predecessor who said there is not a lot we can do about things that are happening overseas that are impacting on our economy.  And his leader currently said nobody wants to see interest rates go up but it is a reality of a world where there is inflation. I think Australians understand that. There is a lot of pressure, upward pressure, on interest rates at the moment. That happened when interest rates started to go up, which was on their watch.   Updated at 3.53am GMT    3.30am    There is another dixer on the topic of the day (for Labor at least) the national reconstructive fund. Richard Marles takes this one, which includes this \u2018burn\u2019 on the opposition:  This is another example of the yawning gap between their announcement and their delivery. Highly productive when it came to fanfare, completely hopeless when it came to outcome. All about the half-time entertainment, never about the game.  The AUDACITY! On the day Rihanna\u2019s return to the stage was interrupted by a football game no less.  Updated at 3.39am GMT    3.26am    Sussan Ley to Anthony Albanese:  The IMF has expressly warned against Labor\u2019s $45bn in off budget spending because it will lead to higher inflation, which of course pushes interest rates up. Given the typical Australian mortgage has already increased by $1,400 a month under Labor, why is the prime minister ignoring the experts and implementing policies that will push these costs up even higher? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?  Anthony Albanese: I thank the deputy leader for her question that goes to why is it that the Labor government is fulfilling the mandate that we received last May to establish a series of funds to make a difference to our country? Now, the national reconstruction fund and what it will do to benefit the economy \u2013 if you have a product that I spoke about before, lithium, you can put it on a ship, export it off, wait for it to be made into a product, of a battery, or everything that goes into a solar panel is also of course produced here. We can import it back and take solar panels is a good example. Currently, over 85% of the world\u2019s solar panels are produced in one country. If things continue to project, that figure will rise to over 95% in a decade. Now, if you think about the role that renewables plays and how vulnerable that makes the world to supply chains, it makes absolute economic sense for us to, where possible, make products like that here. It is a matter not just of creating jobs here, it is a matter not just of creating a higher economic growth here, it is also a matter of our national security and our resilience, our capacity to stand up for ourselves, and that\u2019s why we support the national reconstruction fund with $15bn in it. We also have legislation before the house one hour housing Australia Future Fund. Both of those policies announced in budget reply speech is at a time where opposition leaders used to come up with policy. Both of those announced, both of those taken to an election, and both of those that we got a mandate for. Now, that will produce and increase supply of housing. Now, when you build housing, you create jobs... Ley tries to raise a point of order on relevance, and Milton Dick tells Albanese to get on with the answer. Albanese:  The housing Australia Future Fund will not only produce increased social housing. And 4,000 of those homes is reserved for women and children escaping domestic violence. A good social policy. Because last night and tonight and the next night, women and children searching a safe haven from a circumstance not of their arising will be forced to sleep in their car or in a park, or worse still, return to a dangerous situation. That is why we identified this as a major issue. This is about building a national economic resilience. This should be policies that those opposite support. We have a clear mandate for them, and we clearly will continue to support them.   Updated at 3.29am GMT    3.24am    So many dixers that could be press releases. They were bad when the Coalition did them and they are bad now. While still a backbencher, the now Speaker Milton Dick headed an inquiry into how to make QT better, which included ditching dixers for something that would be a better way for all of us to spend our time \u2013 particularly for communities who would maybe like to have some questions answered \u2013 something akin to what the UK parliament does during QT. Alas, we have not seen any regime changes.  Updated at 3.27am GMT    3.18am    Allegra Spender has the first of the crossbench question:  Today, 19,000 refugees received the wonderful news that they would be granted permanent protection in Australia. However, a further 12,000 were not covered by this announcement. Some instead were covered by a failed FastTrack program. These people have lived here for a decade and I contributing to our society and they are some of the most vulnerable in our community including women for Afghanistan and Iran. What is their pathway to permanent protection?  Andrew Giles gets the call up:  I thank her for her question and her interest which she has consistently demonstrated since coming to this place on these issues of people seeking asylum and, frankly, how we can be a nation that shows our better side for the world and, indeed, in this place shows a way in which we can work through difficult policy questions in a manner that is worthy of the Australian people. I do want to make a couple of points in response to her question, however. Firstly is that the prime minister has made clear that what we announced today is a statement that gives effect to a long-standing commitment, a commitment for which the Albanese Labor government has a clear mandate from the Australian people; to recognise that this group of people and as members opposite will know, this is a group of people who arrived long before, before I should say, operation sovereign borders. Perhaps they should reflect that in some of their commentary if they are to act responsibly in our national interest, in our shared interest in ensuring that our border remains secure. I say that to members opposite. But what our announcement does is it contemplates the circumstances of all people in this cohort. It does that and I will brief you on the details later in the day. Let me say this; we contemplate the circumstances of all these people including a large number, 10 years on, who are yet to have a primary decision, in a manner that is consistent with due process that fundamentally comes back to this we believe that it is people who are ultimately found to have been owed protection who should be able to access this pathway.   Updated at 3.23am GMT    3.15am    Peter Garrett is in the gallery. The speaker Milton Dick gives him a shout out.     3.13am    Karen Andrews has the next opposition question and she is INCENSED. INCENSED I tell you!  I refer to the fact that this prime minister has spent decades as an activist seeking to change Labor policy on border protection including campaigning against return backs, offshore processing and temporary protection visas. Can the prime minister guarantee that he has not received any advice that the government\u2019s watering down of operation sovereign borders is likely to result in more people smuggling arrival?  (I mean, young Albanese would probably have quite a few things to say to current Albanese and not all of them favourable given his shift from hard left to the centre, but then again, Matt Canavan says he was a Marxist during uni, so you know) Anthony Albanese:  I can guarantee that we will implement the precise policy which we took to the election. The precise policy which, which is the policy that I support because I am the leader and we took it to the election and I have not seen a need to swear myself into other portfolios. Because, because when you lead your party to an election and when as we did last May, implement the policies that you put in place and you do not, you do not run around and undermine your ministers like your leader did to you when you were the Minister. I can also guarantee that we will not be sending out shonky text messages on the date of the next election.   Updated at 3.22am GMT    3.09am    Jim Chalmers says some things that could have been a media release. Moving on.     3.05am   Question time begins  We are straight into it. And first up Peter Dutton has a question for the PM:  Has the ... government received any warning from agencies officials or foreign governments this decision could lead to a increase in people smuggling arrivals?  Anthony Albanese: This Government will continue to be tough on borders without being weak on humanity. (There are quite a few interjections at this, but Albanese continues, going through how it was a Labor election promise) He then says:  This only applies to people from 2013 or before. So what we have in terms of those people is that during the nine years in which they were in office, the nine years, not one of those people was sent back. Not one, to Afghanistan or Iran \u2013 if they are arguing that they should send back and if it had only they had a fourth term they would have acted and sent them back and they should stand up and argue that that is the case.  Dutton has a point of order \u2013 on relevance. Has there been any warnings? Albanese doesn\u2019t answer that part of the question:  We were clear before the election that we would do exactly what we told the Australian people we would do for the election and we have a mandate for it.   Updated at 3.22am GMT    2.43am    Disability royal commission received 9,000 complaints, hearing told The disability royal commission has received more than 9,000 accounts of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation, a hearing has been told. Kate Eastman SC, counsel assisting the royal commission, told the inquiry on Monday it had received 9,094 accounts through submissions and private sessions as at 3 January 2023. She said 1,198 \u2013 or 13% \u2013 related to service providers or support workers and that, of those alleged incidents, 53% were instances of violence or abuse. The figures come after the NDIS watchdog\u2019s first own motion investigation looked at about 7,000 \u201creportable incidents and complaints concerning supports to people with disability\u201d among people living in group homes run by some of the largest providers in the country. Those complaints were received between 1 July 2018 until 30 September 2022. The royal commission is holding one of its final hearings this week in Brisbane, exploring the role of NDIS providers, including whether organisations that have faced scrutiny during the inquiry have taken steps to improve their services. The commission held its first hearing in September 2019.  Updated at 2.55am GMT    2.35am   Pezzullo apologises to government for 'regrettable, significant' Nauru lapse  The home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, has issued an apology to the government over the failure to renew the instrument designating Nauru as a regional processing country. Pezzullo said the lapse was \u201cregrettable, significant\u201d and \u201cshould not have occurred\u201d. Pezzullo said there were \u201cseveral\u201d warnings within or to the department from January 2021 onwards that the instrument was due to lapse. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt, representing the home affairs minister, helpfully noted that these were prior to the election of the Albanese government. Pezzullo assures Greens senator Nick McKim there were \u201csufficient alternative legal authorities\u201d to keep people on Nauru, or send them there if needed. McKim asks: which sections of the Migration Act. Pezzullo refuses to say, because the government got AGS advice, and even nominating the sections of the Act could indirectly disclose that advice. Pezzullo takes it on notice, pending a public interest immunity claim from the minister.     2.34am    Here is how Peter Dutton opened his speech during the Closing the Gap motion:  Mr Speaker, nations have complex histories. Histories defined by achievements. Histories marked by blemishes. And our country is no exception. A mature nation, though, doesn\u2019t cherry-pick from its past; it doesn\u2019t rewrite, or cancel parts of our history out. Rather, a mature nation is one which speaks truthfully \u2013 and in totality \u2013 about its history. One which embraces both the light and dark chapters of its national narrative. Australians have every right to be proud of so much that was accomplished by our forebears. For they helped build the modern nation in which we are so lucky to live today. But we also acknowledge that our forebears committed serious wrongs. The wrongs committed against the stolen generations were acknowledged by prime minister Rudd when he delivered the national apology in this place in 2008. He offered that heartfelt apology, without qualification, on behalf of the government and the Parliament of Australia for the actions of successive governments under successive parliaments. For the laws and policies between 1910 and 1970 which saw thousands of children forcibly taken from their families, and for the hurt, the humiliation, the pain, the grief, the suffering, the loss and indignity inflicted upon the stolen generations, their families left behind, and their descendants. The national apology was a profound moment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who had been affected. For Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike. And for our nation. Mr Speaker, 15 years have passed since the apology. This is an occasion for delicate reflection. The national apology was about Australians acknowledging the sins of the past \u2013 \u2018the cold, confronting, uncomfortable truth\u2019, as prime minister Rudd put it. And in that acknowledgement, accepting the flaws and failings inherent in our historical character with the maturity of a modern nation.   Updated at 2.56am GMT    2.26am    Question time is just over 30 minutes away \u2013 so make sure you grab yourself a little treat now.     2.08am   Department was aware Nauru would lapse in January 2021: Pezzullo  The home affairs secretary, Michael Pezzullo, has come back into Senate estimates with new facts about the designation of Nauru as a regional processing country. Pezzullo said that the Nauru instrument sunsetting was first mentioned in a list in January 2021 of regulations that would lapse, but the department \u201cfailed to monitor and track\u201d it. That\u2019s significant \u2013 because the Coalition was still in office and would be for another 16 months. The 1 October 2022 date came and went meaning Nauru lapsed, but the department didn\u2019t notice until 15 December and provided preliminary advice about the problem late that evening. Pezzullo exculpated Albanese government ministers, by noting prior to then the home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, asked on \u201cat least seven occasions\u201d that all administrative arrangements to support operation sovereign borders was in place, and that the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, had also asked for advice about sunsetting instruments. Pezzullo advised that the repeal of the instrument had \u201cno impact\u201d on operations, and \u201cappropriate powers remained available\u201d.  Updated at 2.16am GMT    2.06am    Our Victorian colleague Benita Kolovos has pointed out this tweet \u2013 Alan Tudge doesn\u2019t vacate the parliament until the end of this week, but the preselection jostle is WELL underway.      2.03am   Right-wing terror threat \u2018has moderated\u2019  Earlier, Asio chief Mike Burgess was also asked by the Greens senator David Shoebridge about the small number of right-wing extremist groups listed as terrorist groups in Australia, and whether this is disproportionate to the threat. Burgess said where Asio put its resources was not driven by who was on the list and who was not. And he said some groups were \u201cvery clever\u201d and were very careful to do things to avoid getting formally listed:  I can assure you where we know about them we prosecute them to the fullest extent of our capabilities and law.  Burgess said the threshold for formal listings was set in law, and it was a matter for parliamentarians if they wanted to amend that. Burgess pushed back at the idea that Asio may be playing down the threat of right-wing extremism \u2013 and he gave an update on the current share of the priority domestic counter-terrorism caseload:  My organisation will focus on those who have ideology that believe violence is the answer. It was my agency, and me in my first threat assessment, which was now four years ago, where I actually raised the fact that Asio had seen a rise in nationalist and racist violent extremism. So it was my agency that called this out\u2026We have seen a rise in the number of cases. It did get to 50:50 with our religiously motivated violent extremism cohorts but actually has since moderated. So we\u2019re in the territory of 70:30 - 70 religiously motivated, 30% ideologically motivated, and most of that [latter category] is nationalist and racist violent extremism. So we will - my agency will - go where the threat is. Like you\u2019re suggesting, I\u2019m concerned by the rise in these forms of ideologies and why they have risen.   Updated at 2.12am GMT    2.02am   Asio says \u2018productive year\u2019 rooting out espionage \u2018problems\u2019  The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, told a Senate estimates hearing this morning that his agency had \u201ca very productive year last year removing espionage and foreign interference problems from this country\u201d.  But he said he would not talk about that in detail in public. Burgess made the comment during a series of questions from One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts about reports that China had previously set up a secretive \u201ccontact point\u201d in Sydney. (These claims were first raised publicly last year.) Burgess said he was \u201cnot aware of that\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re assuming it\u2019s true\u201d. He said he relied on his agency\u2019s own data rather than media reporting. Burgess also told the hearing the threat of espionage and foreign interference was real:  It comes from a range of countries - and I think it\u2019s unhelpful for me to call out specific countries.   Burgess also made clear that members of a range of diaspora communities in Australia \u201care not the problem\u201d. He said foreign governments and foreign intelligence services were \u201cthe focus of myself and my agency\u201d.     1.59am    King Charles $5 note controversy resurfaces in Senate estimates Back in the finance estimates hearing, we\u2019re back on the controversy about King Charles not being featured on the new $5 bank note. Paul Singer, the Governor General\u2019s official secretary, said David Hurley\u2019s office found out about it when the Reserve Bank issued a press release publicly on 2 February. Singer said:  There was no consultation with my office. The first I became aware of the decision was the media release from the Reserve Bank.  Singer said he wrote to his counterpart in Buckingham Palace that day, saying he wanted to forewarn the monarchy. He declined to detail the Governor General\u2019s reaction, but said that Hurley \u201cprobably shared my surprise\u201d that they only learned by press release. Liberal senator Dean Smith asked Singer whether he would describe this episode as \u201ca gross lack of courtesy\u201d. Singer said any such comments should be left to others.  Updated at 2.20am GMT    1.58am    Now let\u2019s see what else happened during that hour.  Updated at 2.27am GMT    1.58am    I will bring you some more from these speeches a little later today \u2013 and our video team is working at creating some clips, in Mike Bowers\u2019 absence, to take you into the chamber.  Updated at 2.27am GMT    1.57am    Opposition reiterates support for royal commission into abuse of Indigenous children The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Julian Leeser, has also reiterated his support for a royal commission into the abuse of Indigenous children in his speech to the parliament:  Despite the progress in other areas, some of which are reported in today\u2019s interim Closing the Gap report, this is an Australian failure. It\u2019s a shared Australian failure. In all too many places, alcohol is filling the most unspeakable crimes against women and children and this cannot be allowed to continue. That\u2019s why I support the leader of the Opposition\u2019s call for a royal commission into the abuse of Indigenous children. In many cases, these are the grandchildren and great grandchildren of the Stolen Generations. The member for Maribyrnong was right to call for a royal commission into aged care, a royal commission that Prime Minister Morrison agreed to. The prime minister when opposition leader was right to call into a royal commission for suicide. Prime minister Morrison agreed to it. The leader of the Opposition is right to call for a royal commission into the abuse of Indigenous children and the prime minister should agree to it as well. Royal commissions are never comfortable, I understand that, but frankly there are a whole lot better and facing regional failure after regional failure and simply continuing with more of the same. The prime minister and minister have spoken passionately about the voice. I share that passion. But it\u2019s in our national interest to heed the voices of Indigenous Australians that are speaking now. We must pay attention to the Voices that do not already have a platform in Australian public life and we must heed the calls of children who simple yearning is for a normal life. The sort of life we\u2019d hope for any of our own children. If we\u2019re to break the cycle we cannot afford to ignore these voices any longer.   Updated at 2.02am GMT    1.44am    Linda Burney finishes with:  This is about getting things done and importantly, for people to hold us to account. Governments are better when they listen and when they are held to account. Holding governments to account was not done in the era of the stolen generations. One wonders if there had been a voice at the time. Nor was anyone listening. Today in 2023, a new generation has the chance to do things differently, to create a better future. It is up to a new generation of Australians to help close the gap. We are a great country and we can be even greater if we get the next steps right. By making a lasting different through practical action, one that gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Australians a voice. Let us seize this moment and take Australia forward for everyone.   Updated at 2.04am GMT    1.43am    Linda Burney has highlighted some of the issues the new funding \u2013 just over $400m \u2013 will address. This includes providing safe drinking water. In 2023, there are communities in Australia where there is no safe water supply. Burney:  I want to focus on the first announcement the prime minister has made, $150m over four years to support First Nations water infrastructure and provide safe and reliable water for remote and regional communities. It is a disgrace that in 2023 in Australia there are first Nations communities that do not have reliable access to safe drinking water. An absolute disgrace. It is almost impossible for some people to imagine what it is like to live your whole life in a place where the water is not safe, where dialysis machines cannot work because of the water is not clean enough, and we all know of the enormous problem of renal failure in our communities. And I want to thank the minister for the environment and water for her commitment on this.   Updated at 1.58am GMT    1.42am    Anthony Albanese also became very emotional while speaking about senator Pat Dodson\u2019s experience as a child, hiding in the grass from authorities, as they came to take children away:  When I think of the 1967 referendum and the apology, two great steps forward that we have taken together as a nation, I look to friends and colleagues who embody those moments. I look to my dear friend, minister Burney, who was a young child when it was decided her people were worth counting as Australians. A vote where Australians were offered a choice to right a wrong and they seized it. And I look to senator Patrick Dodson ... as a boy in Katherine, he hid in the long grass when the welfare officers and the police came to take his mates away. Think about that! What a terrifying moment for a child. What a formative moment in a life. He\u2019s seen some of our nation\u2019s story play out before his eyes and yet senator Dodson looks back over our modern history and reminds me that amid the wrongs, there was also such kindness. And that is the spirit of generosity that he brings to his task as a special envoy for reconciliation and implementation of the Uluru statement. A very big-hearted Australian spirit. In 1967, 90% of Australians voted to remove a harmful, discriminatory relic. In 2023, our generation can go one better. Instead of removing a provision that no longer speaks for who we are, we can make a positive change that speaks for the future that we seek to build together.   Updated at 1.58am GMT    1.38am    Linda Burney:  One harrowing story was from Paul. Paul\u2019s mother was tricked into putting him into a home while she recovered from a serious illness. He was made a ward of the state and his mother\u2019s consent was never sought. His adopted family rejected him after seven months and Paul was placed in an orphanage and later with an abusive foster family. In his submission, Paul said, \u2018my mother never gave up trying to locate me. She wrote many letters to the state authorities, pleading with them to give her son back. Birthday and Christmas card were sent care of the welfare department. All of these letters were shelved. The welfare department treated my mother with utter contempt, as if she never existed\u2019. The apology delivered by prime minister Rudd was at its core, about healing, healing deep wounds, closing a painful chapter of denial of our history and opening a new chapter of our collected story, a better chapter.   Updated at 1.58am GMT    1.36am    I will bring you more from the speeches from Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton soon. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, is now speaking.  \u2018One sweet day all the children came back, back to where the heart go strong, back to where they belong, the children came back, back where they understand, back to their mother\u2019s land, the children came back\u2019. The late, great Archie Roach first performed took the children away more than 33 years ago. Archie spoke of the truth that for many years was denied, denied by governments, and denied by parliaments. Children were removed from their families because of the colour of their skin and it was government that did it. Most Australians did not know of this reality. For decades, there was a stubborn silence, but many of those women have suffered a private pain of unbearable loss. It was and is one of the darkest chapters in our history. In 1991, the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody found that of the 99 deaths investigated, 43 were people who had been separated from their families. By 1997, the Bringing them Home report which took evidence from hundreds of people from across the country made 54 recommendations. The report found that one in 10 and one in three Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families between 1910 and 1970, in most of our lifetimes. One of its key recommendations was for an apology to be given by governments. WA was the first state to issue an apology on the 27 May, 1997, closely followed by New South Wales in June of the same year and by 2001, all states and territories had issued apologies. The only holdout was the Australian government under then prime minister John Howard. Recently I went back and looked at some of the account in the Bringing them Home report. So many tales of heartbreak, of lives changed forever.   Updated at 1.57am GMT    1.34am   Peter Dutton explains why he boycotted the national apology  The opposition leader is addressing why he boycotted the national apology 15 years ago as part of his response to the Closing the Gap implementation report (a warning, this includes a reference to the death of an Indigenous woman)  I want to speak directly to those in the gallery today and further afield who are part of the stolen generation and those who are descendants or are connected to the issue and I want to say in an unscripted way \u2013 I apologise for my actions and as the prime minister is frequently able to point it out that I didn\u2019t attend the chamber for the apology 15 years ago. I have apologised for that in the past and I repeat that apology again today. In 2008, I had been out of the Queensland police force for about nine years and I was still and probably truthfully to this day lived with those images of turning up to domestic violence incidents where Indigenous women and children had suffered physical abuse, certainly mental abuse, I remember clearly attending Palm Island where I brought back the body of an Indigenous woman in a body bag who had been thrust off a cliff to her death and I remember thinking at the time that those incidents were still occurring on a daily basis in 2008. And the judgement that I formed was that if we were to make an apology, it needed to be at a time when we had addressed and we had curbed that violence and those incidents. I failed to grasp at the time the symbolic significance to the stolen generation of the apology. It was right for prime minister Rudd to make the apology in 2008. It\u2019s right that we recognise the anniversary today, it\u2019s right that the government continues its efforts and in whatever way possible, we support that bipartisan effort.   Updated at 1.58am GMT    1.30am    Anthony Albanese finishes with a plea to support the voice:  This can be a moment of national unity. An extraordinary opportunity for every Australian to be counted and to be heard, to own this change and be proud of it and truly lead with the spirit of a fair-go. We are a nation of goodwill and good heart. I believe there\u2019s no challenge that is beyond us. Many Aboriginal people across the country celebrate the rising of the Morning Star, it\u2019s like ushering in a new phrase of life for the oncoming generation. It is a transformative time of song and celebration - marking joy in the ongoing survival of their peoples. The people of Australia through the invitation embodied in the Uluru statement have been asked to travel on this journey. We have a chance to add a bright new season to the calendar and a future that embraces all of us.   Updated at 1.58am GMT    1.23am    The opposition side of the chamber isn\u2019t as full as it could be for this Closing the Gap address.  There seems to be quite a few missing. Outside business can keep people away from the chamber, but where possible, for statements like this, people try to reschedule.      1.15am    Anthony Albanese:  It is easy to say the apology did not fix everything. That is true, it did not. But what single thing can? What moment can? There is no step that can on its own get us to our destination but we keep taking steps and we keep walking. One of the apology\u2019s great achievements was to keep alive the faith and decency and the hope for reconciliation [from] the Uluru statement from the heart. The apology can never be the end of a story but the close of the chapter and the beginning of a better one. Not everyone supported the apology 15 years ago, though some have since expressed their regret. There is a long way to go. Just how far is spelt out each year in the Closing the Gap report. As of next year, the report will be issued as it was intended in conjunction with the apology anniversary. When it was tabled a few months ago, the gaps not only persist but some are getting bigger. The report lays out forensically one lopsided statistic after another, in health, education, incarceration rates and especially damning, life expectancy. These are not gaps, they are chasms. It is clear that not enough support has been directed towards organisations to deliver for communities. It is clear that we have left too swiftly from a climate of federal intervention to simply telling communities, you are on your own. We have seen this in Alice Springs and in so many communities beyond.   Updated at 1.59am GMT    1.12am    Closing the Gap statement returned to start of parliament year The Albanese government has returned the Closing the Gap statement to the beginning of the parliament year (it had been moved by the previous government in recent years). The announcement was made ahead of time ( you can catch up here if you haven\u2019t seen it). Here is part of Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech:  On this day, 15 years ago, members of the stolen generations came to this parliament which for so long had cast its shadow is a pinnacle of a system that had failed them. Historically, governments of all persuasions have failed Aboriginal and Torres Strait people, yet those members of the Stolen Generations came here, with such grace. So much had been taken from them but their hearts had so much to give. I say to them, your courage showed us that when we are brave enough to acknowledge failure we can find the strength to take the next step forward together. The apology was the first act on the first parliamentary sitting day of the Rudd government. It was certainly my proudest moment in this chamber and from prime minister Rudd we heard the words that reverberated across Australia, \u2018I am sorry on behalf of our nation.\u2019 Contrary to the doomsayers, it was a positive moment for the nation, a moment of unity, a moment on the road to healing and unburdening. And for everyone who had put themselves through the ordeal of reliving their childhood, and I thank those men and women who spoke to me this morning about their experience, this was confirmation that their voices had at last been heard. Like prime minister Keating before him, prime minister Rudd understood that until a nation acknowledges the full truth of its history, it remains burdened by its weight. In acknowledging the past, prime minister Rudd said we were, to quote him,\u201d lay claim to a future that embraces all Australians\u201d, all Australians. Truth can be hard for those speaking it, for those listening but it is ultimately what lets us move forward as one.   Updated at 1.59am GMT    1.06am    The national director at Democracy in Colour, Neha Madhok has responded to the TPV announcement \u2013 making the point, which has been made by some others, that the announcement does not cover everyone.  The government must ensure that wait times aren\u2019t too long for people who have already had to wait years for an announcement like this.What we find really problematic and concerning is that just last week, Labor decided to send 100 people back to offshore detention. This is at direct odds with the idea that they support people seeking safety and asylum. The federal government must have consistently humane policies affords people on temporary visas dignity and stability.Democracy in Colour\u2019s migration with dignity campaign is calling for greater pathways to permanency options for anyone seeking asylum, and more broadly, access to support and services for people who are living on temporary visas in Australia, and shorter and fairer processing times for everyone on a temporary visas.  The Migration with Dignity campaign is calling for:  An overhaul of the permanent residency points system to stop discriminating on the basis of race by default and create clearer pathways to permanent migration. The ending of corporate ties to temporary migration sponsorship and stopping the privatisation of the visa system. Allowing working migrants access to basic welfare services such as medicare.   Updated at 1.59am GMT    12.54am   Nauru lapse caused by 'human and administrative error': Pezzullo  The home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, has begun giving evidence at Senate estimates. Pezzullo said since 1 July there has been a 360,000 reduction in the visa waitlist that is now below 600,000. Pezzullo said that the sunsetting of Nauru as a regional processing country was the result of \u201chuman and administrative error within the department\u201d. It lapsed on 1 October, was redesignated by the minister on 5 February and approved by parliament on 7 February. The Liberals want to ask about Nauru right away, arguing it is a cross-departmental matter. Pezzullo agrees and says he\u2019ll get onto it immediately after lunch. So there\u2019s a one hour break, then back into Nauru at 12.50pm.  Updated at 1.17am GMT    12.46am    In case you didn\u2019t see this yesterday, Vanessa Turnbull-Roberts wrote this piece about being removed from her home as a child:      12.44am    Bridget McKenzie\u2019s register of interests under spotlight The finance and public administration committee has been going around the rules of politicians\u2019 disclosures on their register of interests, with some controversy as Labor senator Jana Stewart put the scrutiny on the disclosures of Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie.  Stewart asked the Department of the Senate about the rules on disclosures, noting that McKenzie had declared \u201c2 x Australian Open Tickets - 19 Jan 2022\u201d two weeks ago. The Senate representatives noted senators had to declare gifts of a certain price threshold, within 35 days. Stewart mused that declaring hospitality from 19 Jan 2022, in February 2023, was outside the 35 day window. While noting that McKenzie has declared a large number of gifts that fell well below the price threshold, including books, pins and chocolates - but also pointed out that not all the gifts included a note of where those gifts had come from. Coalition senators on the committee raised complaints about Labor senators getting most of the time to ask questions, noting that estimates is traditionally a time where non-government senators get lots of time to scrutinise the government. The Senate representatives noted that the McKenzie example wasn\u2019t the only time where senators had potentially failed to meet the disclosure rules. Liberal senator Richard Colbeck then got the call, clarifying that the rules for MPs in the House of Representatives were very similar to those in the Senate. He also pointed out that sports minister Anika Wells, as of today, appeared to not have updated her register since visiting a cricket game in Hobart and the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in November. The Senate representative said there were \u201ccases across both houses where the strict terms of the resolutions may not have not been complied\u201d.Liberal senator James McGrath hit back at the Labor line of questioning, interjecting: \u201cjust check when PMO [the prime minister\u2019s office] send you these things, to say \u2018have we crossed out Ts and dotted our Is\u2019?\u201d \u201cLabor don\u2019t have a clear record here.\u201d  Updated at 1.04am GMT    12.44am    NSW emergency official grilled over local economic recovery program In Senate estimates, Labor\u2019s Nita Green has been asking National Emergency Management Agency officials about the local economic recovery program, the subject of a damning NSW auditor general\u2019s report that funds were diverted away from Labor seats. Green asked the deputy co-ordinator general Rina Bruinsma about the fast-tracked projects stream. Bruinsma said that state and territory governments were responsible for identifying projects, the commonwealth then only checked if they met funding requirements. The threshold was raised to $1m, which Green said was \u201cquite important\u201d for the audit\u2019s finding of who got funding. Bruinsma said Nema only became aware of this after the fact. Asked who made the decision, Bruinsma said her understanding is that project funding went through the NSW cabinet process, including their expenditure review committee. She said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t definitively say it was a cabinet decision\u201d. She said:  But that wasn\u2019t provided to us. Under the framework the commonwealth wasn\u2019t necessarily privy to all the processes to identify projects ... In order for NSW to receive their share of the funding it had to go through NSW cabinet.  Green suggested it wasn\u2019t just the NSW minister but also the NSW ERC who made the decision.  Bruinsma:   I can\u2019t speak on behalf of the NSW government ... It was in that context, is all I\u2019m saying.  After concerns were raised over the first round, the NSW government invited a commonwealth observer for subsequent rounds.  Updated at 12.53am GMT    12.43am    Covid angst and volatility has reduced, Asio says The Greens senator David Shoebridge asks about Asio\u2019s past findings that specific issue-motivated violent extremism grew through Coivd-19 and its associated lockdowns \u2013 including sovereign citizen beliefs and anti-vaxxers. Shoebridge asks whether that landscape had changed in any way.  The Asio chief, Mike Burgess, tells the Senate estimates hearing:  In response to those people who were agitated by Covid measures and the introduction of more volatility to the mix of people who might be driven by their own grievances \u2013 and I stress I\u2019m focusing on the small number of those that might think violence is the answer; for everyone else they\u2019re entitled to be agitated about these things \u2013 the volatility has reduced somewhat, in particular around the Covid [measures], so there\u2019s less angst these days. We\u2019re not subject to mandates. Some of that feeling does live on but the number of cases we\u2019re looking at, they\u2019ve reduced significantly. Whilst I said in my opening remarks that we have lowered the threat level, it is true there are less people in this country who want to conduct acts of violence in the name of their cause, there is still volatility in the mix with people who have a range of grievances around social, economic or some conspiracy theory-driven grievance, and a small percentage of them think violence is the answer. So it\u2019s still very much in the mix but the number of caseloads that Asio is looking at has reduced. Shoebridge asks:   Is there any link between those angry agitated \u2013 minority of those individuals \u2013 and what you describe in your annual report as the global growth in ideologically motivated violent extremism particularly nationalist or racially motivated extremists? Do you see a link between those two elements in society?  Burgess replies:  Not a direct link, no. Of course we saw a range of people across all walks of life who had problems with Covid and what was happening around them and to them, but no specific direct link in terms of: we did not see nationalist and racist violent extremists - or neo-Nazis - egging that on or running to that cause, other than of course they were using the dissatisfaction and angst as a potential recruitment mechanism. But are those ideologies linked? No they\u2019re not.  As the Senate hearing continues, Shoebrige wants to know whether \u201copportunistic nasty violent rightwing ideologues may have used the anti-vax movement as a recruitment base\u201d. Burgess says:  They were certainly using the angst as a means to promote their own cause and brand of course their recruitment.  Asked if they have had any success in that, Burgess replies:  It\u2019s a great question, senator. It\u2019s still very much a thing in our society, senator, sadly. They do manage to recruit some people. Would I say it\u2019s been a bumper campaign for them? Probably not. But they continue to focus on how they will attract people to their cause.  Shoebridge persists. Did they they expand numbers through those efforts? Burgess:  They were looking for recruitment. The overall number of cases that Asio is investigating though across the board has reduced. So whether or not they\u2019ve been successful or not, I\u2019m not sure I can answer that because we\u2019re only one element and we\u2019re not all seeing and all knowing.   Updated at 12.56am GMT    12.37am    Voice referendum can offer \u2018dignity, hope and the possibility of change, Kevin Rudd says Kevin Rudd, speaking on the 15th anniversary of the national apology to the stolen generations, has also spoke about what it would mean for Australian on the international stage if the voice referendum was to fail:  I shudder to think what the reaction will be across the world were this referendum to fail. If we are seen to turn our back on a simple a request from those who have been the custodians of this ancient land the Dreamtime. Constitutional recognition, the voice, and the outcome of this referendum will not have an impact on the lives of 25 million Australians, but it will offer dignity, hope and the possibility of change for the nearly 1 million Australians who belong to our First Nations.  Given this is the 15th anniversary of the national apology, it is also worth pointing out that one of the targets going backwards in the Closing the Gap measures, is child removal. Indigenous children are being removed from their families at higher rates than ever before.  Updated at 12.41am GMT    12.25am    The international visitors keep on coming:      12.21am   Balloons not the principal means for spying on Australia, Asio says  At the estimates committee hearing, Liberal senator Alex Antic asks the Asio boss about \u201cthe incursion of the CCP spy ballon over the United States\u201d. Antic wants to know whether Asio is aware of any attempted incursions, threats of incursions or actual incursions over Australia. Mike Burgess, the head of Asio, replies drily:  I don\u2019t comment on operational matters. Of course I\u2019m aware of the reporting around balloons and balloons allegedly being used for spying. In my experience that is not the principal means by which people are spying on this country.  Antic asks about any other unknown devices such as UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena):  I\u2019m not aware of any of those, no.   Updated at 12.23am GMT    12.20am    [Continued from previous post] But a dissenting report from the five Coalition members of the committee said they could not \u201cin good conscience\u201d support the changes. They consider it essential for the government to equally fund the \u2018yes\u2019 and\u2019 \u2018no\u2019 campaigns, in the interests of informed debate. Coalition MP James Stevens said:  Any kind of trickery or rigging the system and effectively trying to advantage one side of a debate over the other will only increase scepticism amongst the people of this country and will only contribute to the defeat of whatever proposition is put to them. And it will be difficult to change the constitution anytime we try no matter what the proposition is, and why you would want to add and be saddled with the additional challenge of having made a legislative change that unwinds the precedent of supporting proper debate on changing our constitution in this nation is absolutely mystifying to those of us in the coalition. We urge the government to dramatically reconsider the message it will send and the damage it would inflict on attempts to change the constitution by saying we don\u2019t want to have a properly resourced argument for and against that change.  Independent MP Kate Chaney said she supported the \u201csomewhat vague\u201d recommendation that impartial information should be made available but had concerns about \u2018racist misinformation\u2019:  It\u2019s essential that we do a better job of ensuring truth in political advertising. This is broader than the proposed voice referendum but concerns about racist misinformation in this context are real and sharpens the focus on truth in advertising because of the potential damage that could be done.  Chaney recommended an independent panel to fact check information disseminated in the referendum campaign. Chaney said there should be greater transparency about campaign funding and recommended the immediate disclosure of any donation above $1,000.  For such an important referendum for the future of the country, truth and transparency are vital, and I urge the government to consider improvements to this end in the implementation of the legislation.\u201d   Updated at 4.34am GMT    12.19am    Government supported for funding neither side of voice referendum A parliamentary inquiry into the government\u2019s plans to amend the Referendum Machinery Act \u2013 which sets out the rules about the upcoming vote on an Indigenous voice to parliament \u2013 has tabled its report supporting the government\u2019s changes. The changes under consideration by the joint standing committee on electoral matters include declining to provide public funding for either the yes or no side and abolishing the printing of official pamphlets outlining the campaign arguments. The Albanese government has since decided it will produce the pamphlets. The committee welcomed those plans. Its report said voters need to have access to \u201cclear, factual and impartial\u201d information. It was broadly in favour of government\u2019s decision not to fund either the yes or no campaigns. Labor chair of the committee, Kate Thwaites said:  The committee recommends the government considers how best to can ensure all Australians are provided clear, factual, and impartial information as part of the referendum ... The government has announced that part of providing this information will be a yes no pamphlet, and that this will be coupled with broader efforts at providing the information Australians will need to feel assured they have been informed before they go to the polls. With these considerations and recommended recommendations in mind. That committee supports the passage of the bill.   Updated at 12.36am GMT    12.19am    Electronics spending wanes After a prolonged splurge on electronics and gadgets, Australians are starting to temper their spending. Electronics and whitegoods retailer JB Hi-Fi has reported moderating sales growth in January, and flagged an \u201cuncertain period\u201d ahead after years of pandemic-fuelled purchases, according to its half year results released on Monday. The retailer, which also owns consumer electronics chain The Good Guys, became the darling stock of the pandemic after locked-down customers rushed to buy electronics, gadgets and entertainment systems. Many Australians also had spare money for whitegoods after travel plans were cancelled. The company\u2019s net profit for the six-month period to December was up 14.6% to $329.9m, compared to the same period in 2021. JB Hi-Fi also raised its dividend. Total sales at JB Hi-Fi\u2019s Australian electronics and whitegoods stores were running about one-third higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to its financial results. But sales growth slowed in January in what could be the start of a spending pullback prompted by a series of rises in the official cash rate, pressuring mortgage holders. The Reserve Bank of Australia has warned that \u201cstrong domestic demand\u201d has been stoking inflationary pressures, with further increases in interest rates likely needed over the months ahead to quash those pressures.  Updated at 12.35am GMT    12.14am    Espionage has supplanted terrorism, Asio chief says The head of intelligence agency Asio is up at Senate estimates now. The director general, Mike Burgess, used his opening statement to say the current security environment is \u201ccomplex, challenging and changing\u201d. He reiterates Asio\u2019s position, expressed several times that espionage and foreign interference has \u201csupplanted terrorism as our principal security concern\u201d.  Australia is the target of sophisticated and persistent espionage and foreign interference activities from a range of hostile foreign intelligence services. These activities are an attack on our way of life.  Burgess reminds the committee that he decided late last year to lower Australia\u2019s terrorism threat level from probable to possible. But he adds a cautionary note:  Possible does not mean negligible, however ... Threats to life will always be a priority for Asio.  Burgess says Asio will seek to stay ahead of those threats.  Updated at 12.23am GMT    12.00am    Teal MPs to hold press conference shortly The crossbench is pretty happy with Labor fulfilling its election promise to provide a pathway to permanency for temporary protection and safe haven enterprise visa holders (the refugees who arrived before operation sovereign borders in 2014) Independent MPs Kylea Tink, Allegra Spender, Monique Ryan, Kate Chaney and Zoe Daniel will be holding a press conference on it very soon.  Updated at 12.17am GMT    11.44pm    Referendum Amendment Bill should be passed with amendments, committee says This report has just dropped: The parliament\u2019s Electoral Matters Committee has recommended that the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill 2022 be passed, if amendments are made to strengthen enfranchisement and participation in the referendum, particularly of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and clear, factual and impartial information is made accessible to all voters. Tabling the report today the committee chair, Kate Thwaites MP, said the inquiry and the legislation were focused on technical aspects of conducting a referendum. \u2018Above all, the legislation intends to modernise the referendum process and bring it into line with how recent federal elections have been conducted,\u2019 Thwaites said. The committee recommended that the legislation be passed, but also that:  The government consider any amendments to support increased enrolment and participation in the referendum, particularly of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including in remote communities   The government consider any amendments that ensure \u200bclear, factual and impartial information is made accessible to all voters as part of the referendum process; and   Clear, factual and impartial information is provided in appropriate formats for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voters, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds   Updated at 12.00am GMT    11.41pm    And in case you missed it:      11.40pm    Government should pay for NDIS carers\u2019 annual and sick leave, union says The Australian Services Union wants the government to pay for annual leave and sick leave for all NDIS casuals and contractors. Is that something Bill Shorten is considering? Shorten told the ABC:  I think there\u2019s a legitimate general issue in terms of how we remunerate people who work in the care economy, in the disability sector. For example, in terms of the specifics, we don\u2019t have any specific arrangement that we have in mind. We were able to last July, almost straight after the election, pass on the awarding process which did see several percent of improvement in workers\u2019 wages. The Services Union and other unions in the disability sector are saying to me, Bill, if we want the best possible workforce, we need to make sure we factor in their ability to get trained by their employers.  We need to factor in also that in this sector, a lot of disability carers won\u2019t work for one employer their whole 15 years. The long service leave is a sort of 1970s, 1980s, 1960s proposition that you have a job to live for one employer and the care economy you move between employers, you might be a contractor you might be on one of the internet platforms.  That means that long service leaves just becomes impossible to get. So they\u2019re saying these are important issues which go to a worker\u2019s remuneration so we\u2019re going to have the discussion with them, with employers, with people with disability we don\u2019t have a specific plan specific time I\u2019m but I think it\u2019s wrong of the government of the day and indeed, the broader community just to think that these disability carers who really do very tough work, important work, therapeutic work, when they shouldn\u2019t be subsidising our nation\u2019s desire to care for some of the most vulnerable people. We should be talking about what works.   Updated at 11.48pm GMT    11.33pm    Unlimited carbon offsets \u2018cheap tickets to keep polluting\u2019, conservationist says The Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s Gavan McFadzean is pretty happy the independent senator David Pocock raised concerns about unlimited carbon offsets when it comes to the safeguard\u2019s mechanism on ABC radio this morning. McFadzean said the work Labor has done to restore Australia\u2019s international reputation on climate could be \u201cunraveled\u201d by the inclusion of unlimited offsets:  For wealthy coal and gas companies, unlimited offsets are like cheap tickets to keep polluting business as usual. We urge the government to revise its design so the scheme can actually become an effective tool to cut emissions from Australia\u2019s major polluters \u2013 we can\u2019t offset our way to net zero. Offsets should only be used as an absolute last resort, should not be available for coal and gas companies, should only be accessed once a company can prove it is genuinely making efforts to reduce carbon, and should phase down as a share of the Safeguard Mechanism over time. Plus Australia\u2019s carbon offsets industry needs greater scrutiny and regulation.   Updated at 11.42pm GMT    11.25pm   How safe are MPs\u2019 phones from hackers, senator asks in estimates  Good morning. I\u2019ve been keeping an ear on the finance committee of Senate estimates for the last 30 minutes or so. The Liberal senator James McGrath has just asked officials in the Department of Parliamentary Services whether or not the mobile devices allocated to MPs are safe. He means safe from hacking. The official at the table says there are \u201cconstant\u201d attempts to breach parliament house networks and \u201cmake targeted attacks against us\u201d. McGrath wants a number. How many such attacks in recent months? The official declines to say in \u201can open forum\u201d but says he\u2019ll take the question on notice.  Updated at 12.08am GMT    11.09pm    Flood-hit Lismore awaits buybacks It\u2019s been almost a year since Lismore and surrounding regions were hit by devastating floods. AAP reports that residents are still waiting for information on the buyback programs: Almost a year on from the deadly Lismore floods, the community is still waiting for a single at-risk home to be acquired through a government repair package. Record-breaking flooding devastated the NSW northern rivers in February and March last year, killing five people and destroying 4,000 homes. The unprecedented devastation led to a $520m commitment from the state and federal governments to buy homes and land from people living in the most flood-prone parts of the region. The northern rivers resilient homes fund, with a total budget of $800m, also promised flood victims the opportunity to retrofit, repair, or raise their homes to prevent future flood impact. Close to four months on from the government announcement, locals continue to wait for land buybacks or other remediation packages to be handed out. When asked how many home and land buybacks, retrofitting and home raising packages had been offered, a spokesperson for the Northern Rivers Reconstruction Corporation told AAP it expected to send offers for buybacks \u201cin early 2023\u201d. The assessments of more than 6,000 registrations were in the \u201cearly phase\u201d, she said.  It is anticipated several home owner assessments, valuations and letters of offer for voluntary buy backs under the Resilient Homes Program will be completed in early-2023, with progress updates to be provided to community.  The corporation\u2019s customer outreach and case management pilot launched in December and voluntary buybacks in the areas most at risk of renewed flooding were being prioritised. The spokesperson said:  This early phase involves more than 130 home owners, with the program to ramp up across the region this month.  More than 6,500 people have registered for the suite of offers including buybacks, repair, retrofitting, home raising or knockdown and rebuilds. A further 300 landowners have registered their interest in the $100m resilient land program, where the NSW government will relocate residents to new land, safe from flood impact. Land assessments were under way, the spokesperson said, and a shortlist of landholdings was expected by March. The corporation had held almost 50 meetings with the community and stakeholders over the past three month, she said. Last month protesters rallied outside the corporation\u2019s headquarters in Lismor, holding placards saying \u201cWe need answers\u201d and \u201cLiving in Limbo \u2013 No Really Real Communication\u201d.  Updated at 11.17pm GMT    10.52pm    The House is about to sit at 10am. The Senate is tied up with estimates business, so in terms of parliament movements, it is all about the House this week. But that doesn\u2019t meant that Senate negotiations are not still going on \u2013 we just won\u2019t see the result (if any) of those until parliament next sits in March.  Updated at 10.59pm GMT    10.49pm   Inland Rail review reveals \u2018significant concerns\u2019  An independent review into the Inland Rail project has revealed \u201csignificant concerns\u201d regarding governance and delivery of the multibillion-dollar rail line. On Monday transport minister Catherine King and finance minister Katy Gallagher announced the review conducted by former Sydney Water chief executive Dr Kerry Schott to re-examine the planning, governance and delivery of Australian Rail Track Corporation\u2019s project had been provided to the government. In a statement, King and Gallagher said:  It reveals significant concerns about the governance and delivery of Inland Rail. The Government intends to release Dr Schott\u2019s report and the Government\u2019s response to its recommendations as soon as it has been fully considered.  The update was made in a press release announcing the appointment of Peter Duncan as the new chair of the ARTC board and Collette Burke as non-executive director of the board on three-year terms. Duncan, the current chair of WaterNSW, replaces Warren Truss, who stepped down as chair in November. The Inland Rail project has garnered criticism since its construction began. Critics of the project, including the NSW Farmers Association, said they had been left feeling frustrated and \u201cignored\u201d by the previous government\u2019s failure to heed the views of regional communities. Calls for an independent review into the project\u2019s business case were rejected by the Morrison government on the grounds that a reassessment was \u201cnot an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars\u201d despite the scheme\u2019s major cost blowout.A Senate report released in August called on the government to update the 2015 business case, which originally estimated the cost at $4.7bn. The project is now budgeted at $14.5bn, with costs estimated to exceed $20bn. Read more about the Inland Rail review in this piece from Khaled Al Khawaldeh:   Updated at 12.10am GMT    10.45pm    Pocock calls safeguard mechanism \u2018a massive, complicated beast\u2019 Independent ACT senator David Pocock is a key vote for the government to get its safeguard mechanism though the Senate. Pocock told ABC radio RN Breakfast he was working through his issues carefully:  This is a massive, complicated beast, the safeguard mechanism. I\u2019ve been having some really constructive discussions with the government. I\u2019ll continue to do that in good faith. But I\u2019ve also been speaking to industry climate groups or the interested parties. I\u2019m running a roundtable next week, and then that the Senate inquiry process takes place after that. So I\u2019ll keep engaging and form a position. I do have a number of concerns, but I\u2019m really wanting to engage and find solutions to them.  What are those concerns?  I think the biggest concern is that the government is opening the door to our biggest emitters, paying to pollute rather than becoming more efficient and decarbonising. As it stands, we\u2019re the only other jurisdiction in the world that allows full open access to offset emissions [apart from] Kazakhstan. So if it were to pass as it stands, it would be Australia and Kazakhstan that allow 100% of emissions to be offset using carbon credits. We know that there are concerns around the integrity of some of the carbon methodologies. So for me, integrity has to be at the heart of this policy, we have to be certain that this will drive the sorts of changes that we desperately need.   Updated at 11.04pm GMT    10.24pm    Lowe to front MPs twice this week Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe will front MPs twice this week, starting with Wednesday morning\u2019s estimates hearing followed by an economics committee hearing on Friday. You have to assume a similar line of questions at both, namely what\u2019s behind Lowe\u2019s more hawkish tone for \u201cfurther rate rises\u201d to come, beyond last Tuesday\u2019s rate rise \u2013 the ninth in a row. Before last Tuesday\u2019s rate rise, markets were expecting the RBA to nudge the cash rate to about 3.6%. As of the end of last week, investors are now much more pessimistic, tipping a peak rate of above 4.1%.  Lowe\u2019s appearance before bankers last Thursday at a lunch hosted by (the rather little known bank) Barrenjoey \u2013 as reported by the AFR \u2013 will also get scrutiny. There\u2019s speculation that the discussion resulted in bond yields widening (and prices falling) after the meeting but proving causation rather than correlation will be tricky. Still, Lowe\u2019s absence otherwise in the public arena \u2013 unlike previous starts to the year \u2013 will get some attention. Anyway, if you\u2019d like to hear more about what\u2019s going on with rates and the economy more generally, we have this handy podcast out this very morning:   Updated at 10.42pm GMT    10.23pm    \u2018They\u2019ve opened the gate,\u2019 Andrews says of visa changes Shadow home affairs minister Karen Andrews is doing the most to make the TPV changes a Very Big Issue. Andrews does not believe there should be any changes to the Coalition\u2019s system.  Q: Many of these people have been left in limbo for many years. Is that acceptable? Andrews:  Obviously, we are, all Australians are always concerned about making sure that people are treated humanely, but the balance has to be keeping Australia\u2019s borders strong and to make sure that no people risk their lives to come to Australia by boat. Now, I remember watching the stories of people being plucked out of the water where their boats had basically disintegrated. And I really wonder if the ministers responsible spoke to the officials who were out there day after day, picking bodies out of the water, because if they haven\u2019t, they should have because that may well have affected how they decided they were going to be deal with border security here in Australia.  Q: And just to clarify, would you support this move if the government can guarantee that people from now on who try to come here will be given TPVs? Andrews:  I don\u2019t see how they can guarantee it because they\u2019ve opened the gate. OK. This is the thin edge of the wedge. It\u2019s now permanency for people, for those that have arrived before 2013, the pressure will now be on. And, I don\u2019t know that Labor\u2019s got the strength that it needs to be able to stand up to what\u2019s going to be coming their way*.  *Boat turnbacks remain Labor policy. In 2008, when Labor last abolished TPVs, it also stopped naval turnbacks. That is not the case this time around. Q: Do you think the system should remain as is or do you think there should be any changes? Andrews:  Well, the system should remain as it was under the Coalition government, not the broken system that Labor\u2019s now overseeing what should happen to the people who came after that deadline, there should be absolutely no changes to Operation Sovereign Borders as it was under the Coalition government. And that would mean that people who came here would remain on temporary protection visas. But those people who came here illegally should be departing the country as soon as they possibly can.   Updated at 10.30pm GMT    10.16pm    Joyce v Plibersek Can there be a greater punishment than being the Labor MP chosen to \u201cdebate\u201d Barnaby Joyce on commercial TV each week? That is Tanya Plibersek\u2019s lot. Here is a taste of some of the Seven network chat this morning when it came to electricity prices (Treasury has revised the increase to about 23% after the government intervention). Power prices were always going to increase \u2013 the intervention just meant the increase wouldn\u2019t be by as much. Host: Tanya, let us know how much credit the government can claim here given nothing\u2019s actually happened yet, and are they actually still going to rise just not by as much? Plibersek:  Well this Treasury analysis shows that price rises will be moderated, they won\u2019t go up as much as was initially predicted and that\u2019s because our policies are working, and it\u2019s a shame that Barnaby and his side actually voted against the policies that have brought down energy prices in Australia, on top of not doing anything when they were in government to prepare for these energy price rises. But we know that families are still doing is tough and that\u2019s why we\u2019re also delivering cheaper medicine, cheaper childcare, free Tafe and higher wages.  Host: Barnaby, you guys wanted the government to act, they\u2019ve acted, and the price rises won\u2019t be as big, so you\u2019re pretty satisfied, I guess? Joyce:  Well, you just heard it there. It\u2019s the great swindle. Remember they said they were going to bring down the price of electricity by $275. Now they\u2019re lauding the fact that it\u2019s still going up and it will continue to go up, and at some time in the future, listen to this, it won\u2019t go up as much as they expected it to. Now if you think that is worth banking, good luck. As everything, you will see Liddell get blown up* and this will be under the Labor party\u2019s watch, another power station literally blown up, another restriction on power supplies as we reduce supply and increase price. And I don\u2019t see anything marvellous happening in the future except a Labor party which thinks that the way to fix power prices is to cap the two evils. Remember they don\u2019t believe in coal or gas, but they do believe in capping it because they do understand all of a sudden that it is absolutely connected to power prices.  *This was announced under the Coalition government. There were whole \u201cbig stick\u201d threats over it. Didn\u2019t change anything. The linear nature of time means it will close while this government is in power but it was announced while Joyce and the Coalition had some influence to do something.  Updated at 10.19pm GMT    10.04pm    Snowy Hydro to front estimates Also among those fronting estimates today will be Snowy Hydro and its new chief executive Dennis Barnes from about 2.45 AEDT. There\u2019ll be a lot to go through, including just how stuck is the big tunnel borer (dubbed \u201cFlorence\u201d) near Lake Tantangara. We broke news of the official pausing of the borer here yesterday:  Some estimate Florence has only made 150m progress before hitting soft material that collapsed, creating a \u201csurface depression\u201d (or cave-in) above. Andrew Thaler, a local whose property abuts a supplier of concrete to the project, has sent us some footage of that depression.  If the giant project is significantly delayed the consequences for the national electricity market could be problematic. Snowy\u2019s own website still put the start date as 2025 but it\u2019s told the Australian Energy Market Operator 30 December 2027 is the revised start date. Anyway, an interesting estimates session looms.  Updated at 10.12pm GMT    10.02pm    Lambie expresses reservations about voice and safeguards mechanism Senator Jacqui Lambie, whose party has two crucial Senate votes, has expressed concerns about both the voice referendum and Labor\u2019s safeguards mechanism bill. On the voice, Lambie told reporters in Canberra:  I tell you what I\u2019m going to do: I\u2019m going out to those communities over the next three to six months and travelling where [there] used to be ... that cashless debit card. I\u2019m going back out there to see what is happening in those communities to see if anything different is happening. Because don\u2019t give me some nice words, if it\u2019s not going to change the abuse and the alcoholism that\u2019s going on in many of those Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and Western Australia ...  I want to see practical solutions put into place now before you can convince me that that voice is going to do anything. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for and that\u2019s what many Australians are asking for. Show us how this is going to work. Show us how this is going to make a difference in Indigenous life.  On the safeguards mechanism, she said:  There are industries out there where IT has not come through yet and they cannot reduce their emissions as much as they\u2019re trying, and cement is one of them. You know, and when you are building somewhere in South Australia where you\u2019re building a terminal to bring cement in from overseas where they have no emissions policies whatsoever ... we\u2019ve got a problem.  So there needs to be a good look at those safeguards and make sure that we get it right because we do not want to be driving businesses ... out of Australia [to] places in other countries where they\u2019ve got no emissions targets, no nothing, that\u2019s \u2013 no one benefits out of that.   Updated at 10.10pm GMT    9.46pm    \u2018Today marks the beginning of the rest of your lives\u2019 Independent Goldstein MP Zoe Daniel has welcomed Labor\u2019s decision to move 19,000 temporary visa holders onto a pathway for citizenship:  For the sake of the tens of thousands of people who have been waiting and desperately hoping for this day, I welcome this policy change.Three quarters of Australians want a more humane policy towards refugees and asylum seekers. This reflects the feedback that I have received from constituents in Goldstein.More humane policy does not have to come at the expense of strong borders. Rigorous visa processes, including boat turn backs which evidence shows are the biggest disincentive to people getting on boats to Australia, remain central to ensuring both the safety of asylum seekers and effective management of asylum seeker applications.Further, a regional solution must be a priority working with transit countries like Indonesia and Malaysia and, with the current mass exodus from Myanmar, Thailand.Allowing those granted refugee status the right to fully participate in Australian society is critical to our society and our economy.It is appropriate that refugees granted visas can work, build businesses, study, and initiate family reunion so they can progress with a full life and fully contribute to our wonderful country.To those who have come to see me in my office, some of whom have been separated from family overseas for a decade, today marks the beginning of the rest of your lives.   Updated at 9.58pm GMT    9.30pm    Shorten defends Lowe on lunch with bankers Returning to his interview with ABC radio RN this morning, Bill Shorten was very forgiving of RBA governor Phil Lowe\u2019s lunch with bankers. The Australian Financial Review reported there were some movements in bond trading during Lowe\u2019s lunch with commercial bankers \u2013 usually Lowe makes a speech at the National Press Club but he skipped that this year. It will be one of the questions Lowe is asked at his two appearances in front of parliamentary committees this week. But Shorten was a little more forgiving this morning:  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything untoward from a bank talking to bankers. You know, journalists talk to journalists in parliament, we talk to other parliamentarians, so no, I don\u2019t see anything untoward.   Updated at 9.50pm GMT    9.17pm    Estimates on agenda My goodness \u2013 I completely forgot \u2013 but it is estimates time! This is the additional week the Senate won, after Labor put forward a sitting calendar that was a little short on budget estimates. So as always, the finance and public administration committee is up with the Department of Parliamentary Services (always a fun listen) along with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Then there is legal and constitutional affairs where national emergency management Australia and Asio are up. Expect to hear a bit about how the Nauru designation was messed up. The environment and communications committee has the climate change, energy, environment and water department in front of it \u2013 which means it is safeguards mechanism season bb! (Also expect why are power prices so expensive/Labor hasn\u2019t solved world peace questions.) And the rural and regional affairs will have the transport, regional development, communications and the arts departments, where Bridget McKenzie is sure to have a ball. This is the first estimates where Labor has to own most of the issues, so there will be a few shoes on the other foot. No doubt Penny Wong\u2019s eyebrow will still get a workout but it will just be from the other side of the desk.  Updated at 9.26pm GMT    9.00pm    What\u2019s that? The sound of outrage? Right on schedule? Shadow home affairs minister Karen Andrews is VERY outraged at Labor allowing people on temporary protection visas a pathway to permanency:  TPVs are the backbone of the Coalition\u2019s successful and strong border policy \u2013 Labor will no longer be able to say, \u2018If you come by boat, you will not settle here.\u2019 If you don\u2019t support TPVs, you don\u2019t support Operation Sovereign Borders. After Labor abolished TPVs at the end of 2008, 60 boats arrived in 2009 \u2013 and they averaged over 195 per year under Labor between 2010-2013.  Which is not entirely correct. Paul Karp factchecked this during the election campaign when it came up then:  In terms of boats that arrived after the Rudd government abolishing TPVs in 2008, what Andrews leaves out is that boats were also not turned back. This time round, boat turnbacks remain Labor policy. The refugees who can apply for this pathway arrived before Operation Sovereign Borders, and have been in visa limbo for a decade.  Updated at 9.18pm GMT    8.49pm    Shorten says visa decision won\u2019t help people smugglers Bill Shorten is having a chat to ABC radio RN, where he is being asked about Labor\u2019s decision (meeting an election commitment) to allow 19,000 people on temporary protection and safe haven visas to start the application process for permanency. He is asked whether there are any fears this could be used by people smugglers, who could say, \u201cWait 10 years and you could maybe start the process to citizenship.\u201d Shorten says:  Absolutely not. No, they go to third-party countries. We don\u2019t intend to see the the people smugglers model given any oxygen. It\u2019s a terrible way of coming to Australia. It\u2019s horribly unsafe. It\u2019s fatal and deadly. So the answer\u2019s no, no, we\u2019re not.  The cohort of refugees who may be eligible for this change arrived 10 years ago, before Operation Sovereign Borders, and have been in visa limbo for that entire time.  Updated at 8.54pm GMT    8.42pm    $65m for solar thermal project in South Australia The government is investing $65m in a solar thermal project, with the funds to be awarded through Arena (the clean energy fund). Vast Solar will get the grant for its dispatchable solar thermal technology, which minister Chris Bowen said will \u201cuse sunlight reflected off thousands of mirrors and transfer the concentrated heat via liquid sodium to molten storage tanks. The stored energy will then be used to generate electricity when it is needed.\u201d  The large 30MW/288 MWh utility-scale plant north of Port Augusta in South Australia will create up to 450 regional jobs during construction and 70 ongoing operational roles in long-term manufacturing, plant operations and maintenance. This project could lead to larger installations helping to firm Australia\u2019s grid, providing reliable and cheaper energy at scale, as well as creating opportunities to export the technology and generate more jobs.   Updated at 8.52pm GMT    8.33pm   Good morning  A very big top of the morning to you, Politics Live watchers \u2013 and a happy Galentine\u2019s Day to those who celebrate, or even just want to. The second sitting week of the year is going to kick off much where the first left it \u2013 talking about the voice and watching Labor adjust to the end of its transition and honeymoon period. The next Closing the Gap implantation plan will be released, with more money to help address some major issues in some remote Indigenous communities, including a lack of a safe water supply, food security and severely overcrowded housing. Labor is also addressing an election commitment and will begin the process that will allow people on temporary protection visas and safe haven enterprise visas to begin applying for resolution of status visas \u2013 and from there, if successful, begin the path to citizenship. Boat turnbacks remain Labor policy though and this change only applies to refugees who arrived before Operation Sovereign Borders began a decade ago. Alan Tudge doesn\u2019t officially vacate federal politics until the end of the week but we should find out more about when the Aston byelection will be held. The Greens have announced Dorinda Cox as the party\u2019s First Nations spokesperson (no surprises there) in the wake of Lidia Thorpe\u2019s resignation from the party. Cox will help to guide the party\u2019s First Nations\u2019 policy in what is going to be a huge year. It\u2019ll also be a huge week when it comes to parliament. People want answers for the cost of living and the RBA governor Dr Phil Lowe will be appearing not once but twice before parliamentary committees to be asked about the central bank\u2019s interest rate increases plan. With a further 800,000 people to roll off fixed rates into this new variable environment this year, MPs are getting nervous. We know what the answers will be from Lowe \u2013 none of that will change the fact that it\u2019s going to be a tough year for a lot of people. You\u2019ll have Katharine Murphy leading the way this week, along with Daniel Hurst, Josh Butler and Paul Karp. Mike Bowers is on another project at the moment so I\u2019ll have to stumble along without him. You\u2019ll have me, Amy Remeikis, on the blog for most of the day. I\u2019ve had three coffees already. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.  Updated at 9.50pm GMT "

                    "body": "Borrowers have been slugged with a record seventh rate rise from the Reserve Bank of Australia in as many months, as the central bank tries to quell the nation\u2019s strongest burst of inflation in 32 years. The RBA on Tuesday lifted the cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.85%, the highest since early May 2013. The increase was in line with most economists\u2019 expectations. Markets had rated another rate rise as all but a certainty after the September consumer price index rose to 7.3%, higher than market forecasts. \u201cAs is the case in most countries, inflation in Australia is too high,\u201d the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, said. \u201cA further increase in inflation is expected over the months ahead, with inflation now forecast to peak at around 8% later this year,\u201d he said. \u201cMedium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.\u201d  The RBA has now lifted its cash rate by 275 basis points since May, a rate of increase that matches the previous record spate during the second half of 1994. Ahead of the release of its quarterly statement on monetary policy on Friday, the RBA also trimmed its GDP growth forecast to just 1.5% in 2023 and 2024, down from 1.75% predicted in August for both years.  \u201cThe board has increased interest rates materially since May,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cThis has been necessary to establish a more sustainable balance of demand and supply in the Australian economy to help return inflation to target. The board expects to increase interest rates further over the period ahead.\u201d Prior to today\u2019s decision, projections by the four major banks had the RBA\u2019s cash rate peaking at between 3.1% and 3.85%. Australia was the first major country to reduce the pace of interest rate rises in October when the Reserve Bank went with a 25 basis point hike after four 50 basis point rises in a row. By contrast, the US Fed is expected to clock up four consecutive 75 basis point increases this week. With the jobless rate hovering near half-century lows at 3.5%, the RBA will be watching closely what happens to salaries. The pricing behaviour of companies will also be a focus.  \u201cWages growth is continuing to pick up from the low rates of recent years, although it remains lower than in many other advanced economies,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cA further pickup is expected due to the tight labour market and higher inflation. \u201cGiven the importance of avoiding a prices-wages spiral, the board will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms in the period ahead.\u201d Market reaction to the decision was modest, with the Australian dollar giving up some of its gains for the day to 64.25 US cents. The stock market extended its advance, with the ASX 200 benchmark share index up about 1.7% for the day near its close. Banks such as the ANZ retained their forecast for how much higher the RBA would lift rates, leaving it at a predicted peak of 3.85% by next May. The CBA has stuck with its forecast of a \u201cterminal\u201d rate of 3.1% before it starts cutting by as much as 50 basis point by the end of 2023. The head of Australian economics at CBA, Gareth Aird, noted the RBA expects the jobless rate to only rise gradually from 3.5% in October to \u201ca little above 4% in 2024\u201d, compared with last week\u2019s federal budget forecast of 4.5% in mid\u20112024. \u201cThe RBA want to keep the economy at full employment, which means they do not want the unemployment rate to rise much above 4%,\u201d Aird said. \u201cIt is very much consistent with the notion of \u2018keeping the economy on an even keel\u2019.\u201d While Lowe did not mention energy prices as a propellent for inflation in his comments, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, indicated the government was preparing a regulatory intervention to bring down costs for households and businesses.  Asked after the RBA decision whether he would back this week\u2019s call by the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, for a domestic gas reservation, Chalmers said he welcomed input from state governments \u201cwhen it comes to working out whether we can intervene in energy markets in a sensible and responsible and meaningful way\u201d. The Albanese government has foreshadowed action such as making the current voluntary code of conduct covering the gas sector mandatory.The treasurer said the government needed to move both urgently and carefully with any intervention because \u201cthere are a number of complex interactions here\u201d. He said energy was a significant component of the inflation challenge, so if there were steps that could be taken to \u201cresponsibly\u201d deal with that, the government would act. Earlier on Tuesday, Chalmers said in addition to a mandatory gas code, the government was looking to \u201cinclude in that a consideration of price and not just supply\u201d. "

                    "body": "The lawyer for four Australian families repatriated from Syria says the focus should be on their recovery, not on the prospect of them being charged with terror offences. Moustafa Kheir, who represents the four women and their 13 children who arrived in Sydney on Saturday, said he had been involved in interviews the women have had with authorities. While he declined to comment on the nature of those discussions, or on whether they indicated the women would be charged, he said the families had cooperated with authorities. \u201cYou are talking of people returning from hell on earth,\u201d Kheir said in a statement when asked about the prospect of the women being charged. \u201cThe focus for now has to be on medicating and mending these Australians.\u201d  Kheir said his clients, which also include some of the about 40 women and children still detained in Syria, would consider consenting to control orders on a case-by-case basis. The four families who were first to be removed were said by authorities to be the most vulnerable. Their resettlement is being coordinated by the New South Wales government as they are repatriated to Sydney, where they had lived before leaving Australia. The women could be charged with foreign incursion offences, despite many claiming they were forced, coerced or tricked into travelling to the \u201ccaliphate\u201d by their husbands or families. Legislation introduced since 2014 has made such prosecutions far easier, but there remains only a handful of people convicted for travelling to Syria or Iraq \u2013 all of them men, the majority of whom were alleged to have planned to fight with or have assisted the terror group.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  On Saturday the repatriated women released a statement, saying they were \u201cdeeply thankful to be back home in Australia with our children\u201d. \u201cWe appreciate the complexity and significant work it has taken from many people, including the Australian government, to bring us home,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe want to express our regret for the trouble and hurt we have caused, especially to our families. \u201cWe are willing to do whatever is asked of us by government authorities to ensure the safety of our families and the Australian community and we will fully cooperate with all Australian law enforcement agencies.\u201d The government is planning two further rescue missions in coming weeks, with at least half of the remaining women and children expected to be resettled in Melbourne, and the rest in Sydney. Kheir urged them to act swiftly. \u201cGiven the housing conditions [in the camp], the reports of malnutrition and existing illnesses we are extremely wary of the impending winter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking of a life-or-death situation here.\u201d  Before the recent repatriation, both states had previously resettled two groups of orphans from seperate families, with five children settled in NSW and three in Victoria in 2019.In each case, both sets of parents died in the Middle East before US-backed Kurdish forces took control of Baghouz, the last remaining Islamic State stronghold, in March 2019. Those children were repatriated by the former Coalition government. In opposition, the Coalition has been scathing of the recent mission, with the shadow minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, saying it had been handled \u201cabysmally\u201d. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, dismissed these concerns saying that \u201cat all times the focus has been the safety and security of all Australians as well as the safety of those involved in the operation.\u201d \u201cInformed by national security advice, the government has carefully considered the range of security, community and welfare factors in making the decision to repatriate. \u201cThe decision to repatriate these women and their children was informed by individual assessments following detailed work by national security agencies.\u201d"

                    "body": "  6.55pm   Closing summary  It\u2019s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:  Western allies appear to have retreated from supplying F-16 and other western fighter jets to Ukraine over the past 24 hours. Joe Biden, US president, when asked at the White House late on Monday if his country would provide F-16s, answered simply \u201cno\u201d, although he emphasised on Tuesday morning he would remain in discussions with Ukraine about its weapons requests.  The UK has also said supplying western jets was not practical. \u201cThese are sophisticated pieces of equipment,\u201d a Downing St spokesperson said. \u201cWe do not think it is practical to send those jets into Ukraine.\u201d They added that prime minister Rishi Sunak supports accelerating support for Ukraine after completing a review that a \u201cprolonged stalemate\u201d in the conflict would benefit Russia. Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s most senior adviser suggested on Monday that Poland is willing to supply Ukraine with the F-16 fighters. Andriy Yermak said Ukraine had received \u201cpositive signals\u201d from Warsaw in a Telegram posting, although Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, was careful to stress his own country would only act in consultation with Nato allies. Ukraine has said it will continue lobbying, arguing that the west had repeatedly said no to supplying weapons such as tanks before relenting over time. Oleksii Reznikov, the defence minister, said on a visit to Paris: \u201cAll types of assistance at the beginning went through the \u2018no\u2019 stage. This means \u2018no\u2019 as of today.\u201d Reznikov\u2019s French counterpart, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, reiterated there was \u201cno taboo\u201d on the supply of jets, echoing similar remarks made by Emmanuel Macron on Monday evening. France also said it would donate 12 Caesar howitzers to Ukraine after the summit between the two ministers. Lecornu said the pair discussed training Ukrainian pilots to fly French fighter jets but that no decision has yet been taken. Ukraine expects to receive 120-140 tanks in a \u201cfirst wave\u201d of deliveries from a coalition of 12 countries, the foreign minister has said. Dmytro Kuleba added that the first tranche would include the German Leopard 2, the British Challenger 2 and the US M1 Abrams tanks, and that Ukraine was also \u201creally counting\u201d on supplies of French Leclerc tanks being agreed. The number of heavy tanks publicly pledged to Ukraine appears to be well short of the 321 that Vadym Omelchenko, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to France, stated last week. Russian forces are preparing for a renewed attack on Ukraine imminently, most likely in the coming months, according to analysts. Citing western, Ukrainian and Russian sources, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said Moscow was \u201cpreparing for an imminent offensive\u201d, pointing to remarks by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who said there were \u201cno signs\u201d that Vladimir Putin was \u201cpreparing for peace\u201d. Russian forces continued attacks on positions across the frontline near the eastern cities of Bakhmut and Donetsk. Moscow\u2019s troops have been pounding Bakhmut in the Donbas for several months, but in recent days the invaders appeared to have opened up a new effort to gain ground around the village of Vuhledar, 30 miles south-west of Donetsk city. The situation in Bakhmut and Vuhledar was \u201cvery tough\u201d, with both areas and other parts of the Donetsk region \u201cunder constant Russian attacks\u201d, President Zelenskiy said. Russian troops have probably developed its \u201cprobing attacks\u201d around the towns of Pavlivka and Vuhledar into a more \u201cconcerted\u201d assault, the UK\u2019s ministry of defence said in its latest intelligence update. \u201cRussian commanders are likely aiming to develop a new axis of advance into Ukrainian-held Donetsk oblast, and to divert Ukrainian forces from the heavily contested Bakhmut sector. There is a realistic possibility that Russia will continue to make local gains in the sector,\u201d it said. Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country is \u201calready ready\u201d to offer more assistance to Russia in its war against Ukraine. Speaking during a state visit to Zimbabwe, a fellow ally of Russia, Lukashenko did not specify what that help would entail. It comes as Belarus and Russia are conducting a week-long session of training for the joint command of their regional grouping of forces. Military casualties on both sides in the war have totalled about 200,000, a western official has said, with a similar number killed and wounded on either side. A higher proportion of Russians had been killed however, the official added, because they have been on the offensive, meaning that \u201cthey\u2019ve suffered more fatalities than the Ukrainians on balance\u201d. The US has accused Russia of not complying with its obligation under a nuclear arms control treaty by not allowing inspectors to visit its nuclear weapons sites. Russia\u2019s \u201crefusal\u201d to allow inspections under the New Start treaty \u201cprevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control\u201d, a US state department spokesperson said.      6.41pm   US and UK rule out sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine  Western allies appear to have retreated from supplying F-16 and other western fighter jets to Ukraine over the past 24 hours, with the UK joining the US in quashing Kyiv\u2019s hopes it could obtain the jets soon after the west agreed to send it tanks. Joe Biden, US president, when asked at the White House late on Monday if his country would provide F-16s, answered simply \u201cno\u201d, although he emphasised on Tuesday morning he would remain in discussions with Ukraine about its weapons requests. Later on Tuesday, the UK also said supplying western jets was not practical. \u201cThese are sophisticated pieces of equipment,\u201d a Downing St spokesperson said. \u201cWe do not think it is practical to send those jets into Ukraine.\u201d Ukraine responded by saying it would continue lobbying, arguing that the west had repeatedly said no to supplying weapons such as tanks before relenting over time. Oleksii Reznikov, the defence minister, said on a visit to Paris:   All types of assistance at the beginning went through the \u2018no\u2019 stage. This means \u2018no\u2019 as of today.  His French counterpart, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, reiterated there was \u201cno taboo\u201d on the supply of jets, echoing similar remarks made by Emmanuel Macron on Monday evening. France also said it would donate 12 Caesar howitzers to Ukraine after the summit between the two ministers. Read the full story here:      6.13pm    Belarus and Russia are conducting a week-long session of training for the joint command of their regional grouping of forces, according to the Belarusian defence ministry. The training is part of preparation for joint drills the two countries will hold in Russia in September, the ministry added in a statement.         5.45pm    The US has accused Russia of not complying with its obligation under a nuclear arms control treaty by not allowing inspectors to visit its nuclear weapons sites.  Under the 2010 New Start treaty, US and Russian inspectors can visit each other\u2019s nuclear weapons sites. It is the last remaining arms control treaty in effect between the US and Russia, and its inspection and verification clauses are widely seen as vital in building mutual confidence and preventing nuclear miscalculation. Russia\u2019s \u201crefusal\u201d to allow inspections \u201cprevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control\u201d, a US state department spokesperson said today. The spokesperson added that Moscow had a \u201cclear path\u201d for returning to compliance by allowing inspection activities, adding that the US remains ready to work with Russia to fully implement the treaty. Mutual inspections under the treaty had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, with talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections due to take place last November in Egypt. Russia postponed them and neither side has set a new date for a meeting.     5.21pm    The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has urged western allies to provide more military support amid renewed calls from top Kyiv officials for fighter jets. Podolyak posted to Twitter that some EU representatives \u201cbelieve Ukraine shouldn\u2019t be given weapons as the war will spread to Europe\u201d. But, he said:  War is already in the center of Europe.  He also warned that if Ukraine does not get weapons the war will spread to the EU because Russia \u201cwon\u2019t stop the expansion\u201d.      4.54pm   Lukashenko: Belarus 'ready' to provide more help to Russia in Ukraine  Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country is \u201calready ready\u201d to offer more assistance to Russia in its war against Ukraine. Speaking during a state visit to Zimbabwe, a fellow ally of Russia, Lukashenko stressed Russia does not need \u201cany help\u201d right now. Asked whether he was under any obligation to step up support for Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, he added:  If our Russian brothers need help, we are always ready to offer such assistance.  He did not specify what that help would entail.   Lukashenko, a close ally of his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, was visiting the southern African country to cement economic and political ties between Belarus and Zimbabwe.  The two countries cooperate closely, especially in agriculture, and Lukashenko on Tuesday offered Zimbabwe more tractors, combine harvesters and trucks. Zimbabwe has not publicly condemned Russia for invading Ukraine. Belarus has not commited any of its troops to the war in Ukraine, but it has allowed Russia to stage part of its invasion from its territory last February and has also been a launching pad for Russian missiles into Ukraine. Russia and Belarus engaged in joint military exercises on Belarusian territory earlier this month.   Updated at 5.17pm GMT    4.11pm    On the outskirts of Tournai, a sleepy medieval town in the gentle, Brueghelian landscape of the French-speaking part of Belgium, there is an unassuming grey hangar, barely hidden behind a fence. Inside are rows upon rows of German-made Leopard 1 tanks and other heavy fighting vehicles \u2013 some of the same types of weapons that top Ukraine\u2019s military wishlist. The hangar belongs to the Belgium defence company OIP and contains one of the biggest privately owned reserves of weapons in Europe. \u201cMany of these tanks have been sitting here for years. Hopefully, now it is the time they finally see some action in Ukraine,\u201d said Freddy Versluys, the head of OIP, as he toured the hangar. \u201cHere we have the 50 Leopard 1s,\u201d he said, pointing.   We also have 38 German Gepard tanks, 112 Austrian SK-105 light tanks, and 100 Italian VCC2 and 70 M113 armour carriers.  In total, his firm has about 500 armoured vehicles in stock, \u201cprobably the widest private arsenal of tanks in Europe,\u201d according to Versluys, who has a long history in the military sector.  After completing his military service, Versluys spent nine years working for the Belgian army in a division that was responsible for the quality control of tanks and ammunition. In 1989 he joined OIP, a firm that specialised in optical equipment, where he eventually set up OIP Land Systems, a subsidiary company that bought up old military equipment, banking that one day there would be a demand for it again. \u201cEverything we do is legal here, we go by the books and have all the licences needed,\u201d he said, shrugging at the \u201carms dealer\u201d label. Read the full story here:      4.00pm   Summary of the day so far  It\u2019s 6pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:  Military casualties on both sides in the war have totalled about 200,000, a western official has said, with a similar number killed and wounded on either side. A higher proportion of Russians had been killed however, the official added, because they have been on the offensive, meaning that \u201cthey\u2019ve suffered more fatalities than the Ukrainians on balance\u201d.

The number of heavy tanks publicly pledged to Ukraine appears to be well short of the 321 that Vadym Omelchenko, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to France, stated last week. Joe Biden said the US would not supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, a significant and potentially terminal setback to Kyiv\u2019s campaign to obtain the fast jets that had been rapidly gaining momentum. The US president, when asked at the White House if his country would provide F-16s, answered simply \u201cno\u201d, days after national security officials had said Washington would be discussing the issue \u201cvery carefully\u201d with allies. Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s most senior adviser has suggested Poland is willing to supply Ukraine with the F-16 fighters. Andriy Yermak said Ukraine had received \u201cpositive signals\u201d from Warsaw in a Telegram posting, although Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, was careful to stress his own country would only act in consultation with Nato allies. France will send 12 additional Caesar howitzers to Ukraine, the defence minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu has said. Speaking after meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksiy Reznikov in Paris, Lecornu said the pair discussed training Ukrainian pilots to fly French fighter jets but that no decision has yet been taken. France would also send 150 army staff to Poland to train up to 600 Ukrainian soldiers a month there, he added. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, supports accelerating support for Ukraine after completing a review that a \u201cprolonged stalemate\u201d in the conflict would benefit Russia. A No 10 spokesperson added that it would not be \u201cpractical\u201d for the UK to send its fighter jets to Ukraine, as Britain\u2019s Typhoon and F35 fighter jets \u201care extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly\u201d. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg and Japan\u2019s premier Fumio Kishida pledged on Tuesday to strengthen ties, saying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and its growing military cooperation with China had created the most tense security environment since the second world war. The comments came after Stoltenberg visited South Korea where he urged Seoul to increase military support to Ukraine and gave similar warnings about rising tension with China. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the president of Croatia, Zoran Milanovi\u0107, for saying Crimea would never return to Ukrainian control, describing his comment as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. On Monday, in remarks detailing his objection to Zagreb providing military aid to Kyiv, Milanovi\u0107 said it was \u201cclear that Crimea will never again be part of Ukraine\u201d.  Hello everyone, it\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from Ukraine. I\u2019m on Twitter or you can email me.  Updated at 4.12pm GMT    3.33pm   France to send 12 additional Caesar howitzers to Ukraine  France will send 12 additional Caesar howitzers to Ukraine, the defence minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, has said. Speaking after meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksiy Reznikov in Paris, Lecornu said the pair discussed training Ukrainian pilots to fly French fighter jets but no decision has yet been taken. He reiterated that France\u2019s position on supplying arms to Kyiv was that the weapons be used only by Ukraine to defend itself. Paris has already delivered 18 Caesar howitzers to Kyiv.  France would also be sending 150 army staff to Poland to train up to 600 Ukrainian soldiers a month there, he added. He also said \u201cthere is no taboo\u201d when asked about supplying fighter jets to Ukraine.  Updated at 4.40pm GMT    3.03pm   Military casualties on both sides in war total around 200,000 \u2013 western official  A Western official said in a briefing that military casualties on both sides in the war totalled about 200,000 - with a similar number killed and wounded on either side. A higher proportion of Russians had been killed however, the official added, because they had been on the offensive, meaning that \u201cthey\u2019ve suffered more fatalities than the Ukrainians on balance\u201d. The general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, in its latest update, claimed to have killed about 127,500 members of pro-Russian forces. Russia has not yet started a major offensive despite increased attacks in the eastern Donbas over the past week, but it is engaged in a lesser effort that is able to make \u201cno more than tactical gains\u201d, the official added. Ukraine\u2019s loss of Soledar was a \u201cpyrrhic victory\u201d in which it incurred \u201cseveral thousand casualties\u201d to \u201csecure a ruined town with no more than 500 inhabitants remaining\u201d. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, believed there was a military deadlock at present \u2013 with the war likely to last throughout 2023. When each side\u2019s positives and negatives were stacked up, the official said, \u201cyou end up in some sort of grinding conflict\u201d, meaning there would need to be a change on either side for there to be a breakthrough. For Russia to break through, the official said, it would need to launch a fresh round of mobilisation on top of the 300,000 the Kremlin forcibly recruited last year \u2013 while Ukraine would have to rely on further weapons supply from the west coupled with its tactical innovation on the battlefield. Confirmed tank donations include 31 Abrams tanks from the US, plus 14 Leopard 2s from Germany and Poland plus 14 Challenger 2s from the UK and 4 more from Canada, a total of 77. The Netherlands has said it could send up 18 Leopard 2s it leases from Germany and Norway up to eight, taking the figure to about 100, with Finland, Denmark and Spain all promising to send an unspecified number. Earlier today, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Kyiv expected 120-140 western tanks in a \u201cfirst wave\u201d of deliveries.  Updated at 3.55pm GMT    2.30pm    My colleague Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, writes about the number of tanks pledged to Ukraine in a thread on Twitter. He tweets: \u201cWestern officials said Ukraine has received tank pledges that \u2018exceed the 300 mark\u2019 based on public statements from Ukrainian officials. Public pledges are far lower, however, and the only public statement I can immediately see is from Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to France. Last Friday Vadym Omelchenko told BFM television that 321 heavy tanks had been pledged. Might he be included Bradley and Marder fighting vehicles as well?\u201d Sabbagh then breaks down the tanks that have been pledged in public, saying it \u201clooks well short of 300 though\u201d.   Updated at 2.49pm GMT    2.08pm    Reuters is carrying a little more detail on Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, saying that Kyiv expected 120 to 140 western tanks in a \u201cfirst wave\u201d of deliveries. [See 13.08 GMT] Kuleba said that the first tranche would include the German Leopard 2, the British Challenger 2 and the US M1 Abrams tanks, and that Ukraine was also \u201creally counting\u201d on supplies of French Leclerc tanks being agreed. Kuleba said Kyiv was working behind the scenes to win over more countries to supply tanks at what officials say is a critical time in the war. \u201cWe continue to work on both expanding the membership of the tank coalition and increasing the contributions of those already pledged,\u201d he said. Kyiv plans to launch a major counteroffensive to recapture swathes of territory taken by Russia in the south and east of the country, but is concerned that Russia could launch its own major offensive in the coming weeks or months.  Updated at 2.16pm GMT    1.58pm      Updated at 2.03pm GMT    1.45pm    A former commander of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group who is seeking asylum in Norway has apologised to Ukrainians living in the country who object to his presence there. Andrey Medvedev fled his unit and crossed the border into Norway near the Pasvikdalen valley, where he was arrested and detained by border guards. He is the first known soldier from the Wagner group who fought in Ukraine to flee abroad. Speaking to Norwegian broadcaster NRK and reported by AP, Medvedev said:  I\u2019m a scoundrel to you, but I only ask you to take into account that I have come to realise that, albeit belatedly, and I spoke against all that.  He added:  I ask you not to condemn me, and in any case I apologise.  In an interview conducted in December with the Guardian, Medvedev spoke of how he feared for his life and said he had witnessed the summary killing of Wagner fighters accused by their own commanders of disobeying orders, sometimes in pairs. He is currently living in a centre for asylum seekers in Oslo.  Updated at 1.56pm GMT    1.23pm    Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has helped \u201copen eyes\u201d to the idea of reforming England\u2019s increasingly draconian libel and privacy laws, according to one of the country\u2019s leading media advocates. Geoffrey Robertson KC, author of Lawfare, a new book on efforts by the rich and powerful to suppress free speech, said the war revealed the cynical way wealthy Russians \u2013 and others \u2013 have exploited the English legal system. The unprovoked invasion ordered by the Kremlin last February has, the barrister said, \u201cbrought up the way in which oligarchs, as rich people, have been able to intimidate British journalists and British publishers\u201d in costly libel actions. \u201cEyes are opening,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian. Robertson highlighted the case of Yevgeny Prigozhin, who acknowledged he was the founder and boss of the Wagner mercenary group in September, but who, until May, was suing the investigative journalist Eliot Higgins in London for tweeting articles linking the Russian oligarch to the same paramilitary organisation. Last week it emerged that British lawyers acting for Prigozhin, who had been put under sanctions by the UK in October 2020, were given special dispensation by the Treasury to bring the lawsuit against Higgins personally, and for two lawyers to spend \u00a34,000 in travelling to St Petersburg to take instructions. Robertson said:  It\u2019s, in my view, ironic and ridiculous that the UK\u2019s Sanctions Act permits oligarchs who are sanctioned for their human rights abuses, and therefore have no reputation, you would think, [to] bring in money to pay their lawyers to repair their reputation that they don\u2019t have.  The barrister also criticised the soaring costs of defending libel cases in London \u2013 Higgins said last week his costs in defending himself against Prigozhin were \u00a370,000. \u201cBritain is not a land of free speech but expensive speech,\u201d Robertson said. Read the full story here:   Updated at 1.41pm GMT    1.08pm   Ukraine to receive up to 140 tanks in \u2018first wave\u2019 of deliveries, says Kuleba  Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Kyiv expects to receive 120 to 140 tanks in a \u201cfirst wave\u201d of deliveries from a coalition of 12 countries. A group of western countries pledged last week to supply modern-made main battle tanks to Ukraine, after Germany confirmed it would send Leopard 2 tanks and the US said it would supply Kyiv with M1 Abrams tanks. Speaking in an online briefing, Kuleba said:  The tank coalition now has 12 members. I can note that in the first wave of contributions, the Ukrainian armed forces will receive between 120 and 140 western-model tanks.   Countries such as Poland and Finland have already indicated publicly that they are willing to provide a number of their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark have also said they are open to sending their German-made tanks.      12.58pm    Air raid alerts have been reported across Ukraine for a third time today, according to Euromaidan Press.      12.40pm    Boris Johnson is in Washington this week to meet Republican lawmakers as he presses the US to sustain support to Ukraine. The former UK prime minister is scheduled to speak at a private Republican club on Tuesday evening and to meet a group of Republican senators, Reuters reports, citing US lawmakers. He will discuss the need for \u201cwestern unity and support for Ukraine and what more can be done against the threat Russia poses\u201d at the Atlantic Council thinktank on Wednesday. In an opinion piece for the Washington Post published yesterday, Johnson called on Ukrainians to be \u201cgiven everything they need to finish this war, as quickly as possible\u201d and for its admission to the Nato alliance. Johnson wrote:  If we had been brave and consistent enough to bring Ukraine into Nato \u2013 if we had actually meant what we said \u2013 then this utter catastrophe would have been averted.   Updated at 12.55pm GMT    12.26pm   UK accelerating support for Ukraine because \u2018prolonged stalemate would only benefit Russia\u2019  The UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, supports accelerating support for Ukraine after completing a review that a \u201cprolonged stalemate\u201d in the conflict would benefit Russia. In a statement after today\u2019s Cabinet meeting, reported by PA media, a No 10 spokesperson said:  He said since becoming prime minister he had reviewed the UK\u2019s approach and concluded that a prolonged stalemate in the conflict would only benefit Russia. Which was why he had decided there was an opportunity to accelerate UK support working closely with our allies to give Ukraine the best chance of success and make the most of the window of opportunity where Russian forces were on the back foot. He said the new strategy would also see greater diplomatic efforts and planning work with the Ukrainian on how to rebuild once the conflict had ended.  The spokesperson also said it would not be \u201cpractical\u201d for the UK to send its fighter jets to Ukraine, as Kyiv campaigns to obtain the jets to build up a fighting force to break through the Russian lines in the spring. They said:  The UK\u2019s Typhoon and F35 fighter jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly, given that we believe it is not practical to send those jets into Ukraine.  They added:  It is the length of time it takes to learn how to use what are very complex pieces of equipment that is the limiting factor in this case but we will explore what more we can do to support Ukraine.  The UK will \u201ccontinue to discuss with our allies about what we think what is the right approach\u201d, they added.  Updated at 12.27pm GMT    12.05pm    Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, and the US\u2019s new ambassador to Moscow, Lynne Tracy, held a meeting today where they discussed arms control issues, according to the Russian foreign ministry. The pair \u201cdiscussed some pressing issues of arms control at the meeting\u201d, it said. This was Ryabkov\u2019s second meeting with Tracy since she assumed the position of US ambassador to Moscow, the state-run Tass news agency reported. The pair also met yesterday when Tracy entered the foreign ministry to present copies of her diplomatic credentials.   The Russian state-owned Ria Novosti news agency reported that Ryabkov told Tracy on Monday that he expected her to follow the principle of not interfering in Russia\u2019s internal affairs.  Updated at 12.14pm GMT    11.45am    The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said it rejects \u201cdefamatory statements\u201d by Ukraine\u2019s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, who accused the committee of being a \u201cpromoter of war, murder and destruction\u201d after the committee said it would consider ways for Russian athletes to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics. The IOC was offering Russia \u201ca platform to promote genocide &amp; encourages their further killings\u201d, Podolyak posted to Twitter on Monday.   His remarks came after the IOC said it was continuing to work on a pathway which would enable Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals, a move that has been criticised by the British government. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said allowing Russia to compete at the 2024 Paris Games was tantamount to showing that \u201cterror is somehow acceptable\u201d, adding:  As if you could shut your eyes to what Russia is doing in Kherson, Kharkiv, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.  Responding to Podolyak\u2019s tweet, an IOC spokesperson said:  The IOC rejects in the strongest possible terms this and other defamatory statements. They cannot serve as a basis for any constructive discussion.      11.23am   Russia preparing for \u2018imminent\u2019 offensive in Ukraine, says thinktank  Russian forces are preparing for a renewed attack on Ukraine imminently, with the most likely course of action being an offensive in the coming months, according to analysts. Citing western, Ukrainian and Russian sources, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War writes that Moscow is \u201cpreparing for an imminent offensive\u201d. In its latest update posted last night, it points to remarks by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who said there were \u201cno signs\u201d that Vladimir Putin was \u201cpreparing for peace\u201d. Speaking in South Korea on Monday, Stoltenberg said:  We see the opposite. We see that [the Russians] are preparing for more war, that they are mobilising more soldiers, more than 200,000, and potentially even more than that. That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea.   The ISW also notes that a Ukrainian military chief, Ivan Tymochko, stated that Russian forces were strengthening their grouping in Donbas as part of an anticipated offensive. It also cited him as saying that Russian forces would need to launch an offensive due to increasing domestic pressure for victory. The update continues:  Stoltenberg\u2019s and Tymochko\u2019s statements support ISW\u2019s previous forecast that Russian forces are setting conditions to launch an offensive effort, likely in Luhansk oblast, in the coming months.  Hello everyone. It\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email.  Updated at 11.44am GMT    11.03am   Summary of the day so far \u2026   The United States would not provide the F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine was seeking in its fight against Russia, President Joe Biden said on Monday, as Russian forces claimed a series of incremental gains in the country\u2019s east. Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s most senior adviser has suggested Poland is willing to supply Ukraine with the F-16 fighters. Andriy Yermak said Ukraine had received \u201cpositive signals\u201d from Warsaw in a Telegram posting, although Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, was careful to stress his own country would only act in consultation with Nato allies. Russian forces continued attacks on positions across the frontline near the eastern cities of Bakhmut and Donetsk. Moscow\u2019s troops have been pounding Bakhmut in the Donbas for several months, but in recent days the invaders appeared to have opened up a new effort to gain ground around the village of Vuhledar, 30 miles south-west of Donetsk city. The situation in Bakhmut and Vuhledar was \u201cvery tough\u201d, with both areas and other parts of the Donetsk region \u201cunder constant Russian attacks\u201d, Zelenskiy said. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg and Japan\u2019s premier Fumio Kishida pledged on Tuesday to strengthen ties, saying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and its growing military cooperation with China had created the most tense security environment since the second world war. A Russian court has fined the streaming service Twitch 4m roubles (\u00a346,200/$57,000) for failing to remove what it said were \u201cfakes\u201d about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin and deputy chair of the security council of Russia, has boasted that sanctions are having little effect on the Russian economy. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the president of Croatia, Zoran Milanovi\u0107, for saying Crimea would never return to Ukrainian control, describing his comment as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. On Monday, in remarks detailing his objection to Zagreb providing military aid to Kyiv, Milanovi\u0107 said it was \u201cclear that Crimea will never again be part of Ukraine\u201d. Russia and Belarus have started a week-long session of staff training for the joint command of their regional grouping of forces, the Belarusian defence ministry has said.  That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back with you later. L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong will be here with you shortly to continue our live coverage.  Updated at 11.08am GMT    10.39am    Dmitry Medvedev, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin and deputy chair of the security council of Russia, has boasted that sanctions are having little effect on the Russian economy. On Telegram he wrote:  Enemy countries do not have the courage to admit that their \u201chellish\u201d sanctions have failed miserably. Do not work. The vast majority of industrial products and consumer goods were replaced by our own, Russian, and the missing ones \u2013 by Asian brands. Parallel imports also work, from which we get the same western brands, and their owners get nothing. So everything is as always: the Americans make money on a humiliated Europe. Crushed Europe endures and loses money. At the same time, even the IMF predicts economic growth in Russia this year.  Medvedev went on to say that Russia would continue to use western intellectual property \u201cwithout any licences and payment of royalties \u2026 for everything from movies to industrial software\u201d. He then offered praise to those who have pirated software, writing \u201cthanks to those who have developed various programs for the unlicensed use of their expensive intellectual products\u201d and deployed an animated laughing troll emoji as part of the message. Medvedev has previously been both president and prime minister of Russia.  Updated at 11.02am GMT    10.33am    Here are some of the latest images to have been sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine.         10.27am    Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reports on Telegram that its correspondents in Kherson have again heard explosions.     10.26am    The Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg and Japanese premier Fumio Kishida pledged on Tuesday to strengthen ties, saying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and its growing military cooperation with China had created the most tense security environment since the second world war. The comments came in a statement issued during Stoltenberg\u2019s trip to Japan after a visit to South Korea on which he urged Seoul to increase military support to Ukraine and gave similar warnings about rising tension with China. \u201cThe world is at a historical inflection point in the most severe and complex security environment since the end of the second world war,\u201d the two leaders said in the statement. It also raised concerns about Russia\u2019s nuclear threats, joint military drills between Russia and China near Japan, and North Korea\u2019s development of nuclear weapons.  Stoltenberg told reporters a Russian victory in Ukraine would embolden China at a time when it was building up its military, \u201cbullying its neighbours and threatening Taiwan\u201d. Reuters reports he added: \u201cThis war is not just a European crisis, but the challenge to the world order.\u201d  Updated at 11.45am GMT    9.05am    A Russian court has fined the streaming service Twitch 4m roubles (\u00a346,200/$57,000) for failing to remove what it said were \u201cfakes\u201d about Russia\u2019s military campaign in Ukraine, the Interfax news agency reports. Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. Moscow has long objected to foreign tech platforms\u2019 distribution of content that it deems to fall foul of its restrictions, with Russian courts regularly imposing penalties.  Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.01am    Reuters has a quick snap that Germany\u2019s energy regulator has said the country has sufficient gas supplies for this winter, but must start preparing for the winter of 2023-24.  Updated at 9.44am GMT    8.40am    Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the Croatian president, Zoran Milanovi\u0107, on Tuesday for saying Crimea would never return to Ukrainian control, describing his comment as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. In remarks last night detailing his objection to Zagreb providing military aid to Kyiv, Milanovi\u0107 said it was \u201cclear that Crimea will never again be part of Ukraine\u201d. [See 7.20 GMT] \u201cWe consider as unacceptable the statements of the president of Croatia, who effectively cast doubt on the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\u201d Reuters reports Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook.  Updated at 9.45am GMT    8.27am    The leader of the We Are Together with Russia group in Ukraine\u2019s occupied Zaporizhzhia region, Vladimir Rogov, has posted to Telegram to claim that last night pro-Russian forces repulsed an attempt by Ukrainian forces to break through in the region. He wrote:  Zaporizhzhia front: a night attempt to break through the special group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Our scouts, using a Mavic quadcopter with a thermal imager, detected the movement of Ukrainian special forces on the front line at night. The enemy group was promptly hit by artillery. Only one enemy saboteur got up and fled after being covered by an automatic grenade launcher.  The claims have not been independently verified.     8.07am    Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has said that President Vladimir Putin spoke with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a telephone call. In a readout of the call, the foreign ministry stated: \u201cFurther development of bilateral cooperation in the political, trade, economic and energy sectors, as well as cooperation within the Opec Plus group to provide the stability of global oil market were discussed.\u201d  Updated at 9.46am GMT    7.47am    Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne offers this summary of events of the last 24 hours in its Telegram bulletin today. It writes:  At night, Russian troops shelled the Nikopol district of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Three private houses, farm buildings and a power line were damaged. There are no injured. Over the past day, three people were injured in Donetsk region due to Russian shelling. In the Zaporizhzhia region, 14 settlements were shelled during the day, seven in the Kherson region. During the day, the defence forces carried out several strikes on areas where the Russian army is concentrated, hitting three control points and two ammunition depots. Over the past day, the Russian Federation lost approximately 850 of its soldiers in the war against Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported.      7.31am   Russian assault on Pavlivka and Vuhledar becoming more concerted, says MoD  The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has published its daily intelligence briefing on the situation in Ukraine. It says:  In the last three days, Russia has likely developed its probing attacks around the towns of Pavlivka and Vuhledar into a more concerted assault. Russian commanders are likely aiming to develop a new axis of advance into Ukrainian-held Donetsk Oblast, and to divert Ukrainian forces from the heavily contested Bakhmut sector. There is a realistic possibility that Russia will continue to make local gains in the sector. However, it is unlikely that Russia has sufficient uncommitted troops in the area to achieve an operationally significant breakthrough.   The two settlements are situated 50km to the south-west of Donetsk city.  Updated at 9.49am GMT    7.20am    Nato-member Croatia\u2019s president last night criticised western nations for supplying Ukraine with heavy tanks and other weapons in its campaign against invading Russian forces, saying those arms deliveries will only prolong the war. Associated Press report that Zoran Milanovi\u0107 told reporters in the Croatian capital that it was \u201cmad\u201d to believe that Russia could be defeated in a conventional war. \u201cI am against sending any lethal arms there,\u201d Milanovi\u0107 said. \u201cIt prolongs the war.\u201d \u201cWhat is the goal? Disintegration of Russia, change of the government? There is also talk of tearing Russia apart. This is mad,\u201d he added.  Milanovi\u0107 has openly opposed the admission of Finland and Sweden into Nato as well as the training of Ukrainian troops in Croatia as part of EU aid to the embattled country. Yesterday he said he believed that Crimea would never again be part of Ukraine. The Black Sea peninsula was annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move that is not widely recognised internationally.  Updated at 7.32am GMT    7.05am    Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that according to the regional authority, the night passed in the Sumy region with no shelling.  This is Martin Belam taking over the blog in London from my colleague Helen Sullivan.      6.50am   Gazprom gas exports to Europe via Ukraine hit historic low in January \u2013 reports  More now on Europe\u2019s shifting energy demands: Russia\u2019s Gazprom\u2019s gas exports to the EU via Ukraine reached a record low of 951.4m cubic metres in the first 30 days of January, Russian business newspaper Vedomosti is reporting, citing Gazprom figures. Vedomosti reported that Gazprom had shipped 41-43m cubic metres via Ukraine daily during the second half of 2022. However, from 5 January, daily volumes began to fall sharply, with only 24.4m cubic metres shipped daily by 19 January. Vedomosti reported that the decline is primarily the result of reduced demand for Russian gas in Europe, amid an unusually warm and windy winter.  Updated at 7.18am GMT    6.38am    Mild weather, government aid, gas storage facilities at full capacity and energy imports from other regions have helped Europe limit the economic damage caused by the war, AFP reports.  Germany, which relied heavily on Russian gas imports before the war, provided massive aid to consumers, scrambled to fill up its storage facilities and found new sources of energy as Moscow turned off the taps. The government said last week it expects Europe\u2019s biggest economy to avoid recession this year, though data on Monday showed a contraction in the last three months of 2022. To beef up winter supplies, Germany and its EU neighbours bought LNG from Qatar and the United States, which is more expensive than Russian gas that was brought in via pipelines. LNG imports in Europe jumped by 60% in 2022 compared to the previous year, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). As a result \u201cthe worst case scenarios for 2022/2023 winter did not happen,\u201d said Fabian Skarboe Ronningen, senior analyst for power markets research at Rystad Energy. European gas stocks are currently at 72% of capacity \u2013 double this time last year. With temperatures so far this winter more clement than usual, European consumers turned the heating on later, keeping bill rises in check, ensuring reserves stay high.     6.10am    Russia and Belarus have started a week-long session of staff training for the joint command of their regional grouping of forces, the Belarusian defence ministry said on Tuesday. The training is part of preparation for joint drills the two countries will hold in Russia in September, the ministry added in its statement.     5.54am   Ukraine defence minister in Paris to ask Macron for jets  Ukraine\u2019s defence minister is expected in Paris on Tuesday to meet President Emmanuel Macron amid a debate among Kyiv\u2019s allies over whether to provide fighter jets for its war against Russia, after US President Joe Biden ruled out giving F-16s. In remarks carried on French television before Biden spoke in Washington, Macron stressed any such move would depend on several factors including the need to avoid escalation and assurances that the aircraft would not \u201ctouch Russian soil.\u201d He said Reznikov would also meet his French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu in Paris on Tuesday.     5.42am   Biden says the US will not provide F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine  The United States will not provide the F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has sought in its fight against Russia, President Joe Biden said on Monday. Ukraine planned to push for western fourth-generation fighter jets such as the F-16 after securing supplies of main battle tanks last week, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s defence minister said on Friday. A Ukrainian air force spokesperson said it would take its pilots about half a year to train on such fighter jets. Asked if the United States would provide the jets, Biden told reporters at the White House, \u201cNo.\u201d The brief exchange came shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia had begun exacting its revenge for Ukraine\u2019s resistance to its invasion with relentless attacks in the east. Zelenskiy has warned for weeks that Moscow aims to step up its assault on Ukraine after about two months of virtual stalemate along the front line that stretches across the south and east. Ukraine won a huge boost last week when Germany and the United States announced plans to provide heavy tanks, ending weeks of diplomatic deadlock on the issue. \u201cThe next big hurdle will now be the fighter jets,\u201d Yuriy Sak, who advises Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, told Reuters on Friday.     5.30am   Welcome and summary  Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. Our top story this morning: the United States will not provide the F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has sought in its fight against Russia, President Joe Biden said on Monday, as Russian forces claimed a series of incremental gains in the country\u2019s east. We\u2019ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments:  Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s most senior adviser, Andriy Yermak, has suggested Poland is willing to supply Ukraine with the F-16 fighters. Yermak said Ukraine had had \u201cpositive signals\u201d from Warsaw in a Telegram posting, although Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, was careful to stress his own country would only act in consultation with Nato allies, as Ukraine\u2019s lobbying for the combat jets steps up only a few days after Germany and the US agreed to send over tanks. Zelenskiy has called for western weapons to be supplied more quickly. Speaking in his nightly address, the Ukrainian president said Russia was hoping to drag out the war, and exhaust his country\u2019s ability to resist the invaders. \u201cSo we have to make time our weapon. We must speed up the events, speed up the supply and opening of new necessary weaponry options for Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskiy said. The Kremlin warned the west\u2019s supplying of further weapons to Ukraine would only lead to \u201csignificant escalation\u201d of the conflict. Kyiv \u201cdemands more and more weapons\u201d while Nato countries were \u201cmore and more becoming directly involved in the conflict\u201d, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, after Ukraine\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Andriy Melnyk, called on Germany to send his country a submarine. Russian forces continued attacks on positions across the frontline near the eastern cities of Bakhmut and Donetsk. Moscow\u2019s troops have been pounding Bakhmut in the Donbas for several months, but in recent days the invaders appeared to have opened up a new effort to gain ground around the village of Vuhledar, 30 miles south-west of Donetsk city. Ukraine\u2019s military and Russia\u2019s Wagner private military group are both claiming to have control in the area of Blahodatne, eastern Donetsk region. \u201cUnits of Ukraine\u2019s defence forces repelled the attacks of the occupiers in the areas of \u2026 Blahodatne \u2026 in the Donetsk region,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s military reported, adding its forces also repelled attacks in 13 other settlements in the Donetsk region. Wagner, designated by the US as a transnational criminal organisation, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday that its units had taken control of Blahodatne. The Russian government on Monday banned domestic oil exporters and customs bodies from adhering to western-imposed price caps on Russian crude. The measure was issued to help enforce President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decree of 27 December that prohibited the supply of crude oil and oil products from 1 February for five months, to nations that abide by the caps. The new Russian act bans corporates and individuals from including oil price cap mechanisms in their contracts. Ukraine\u2019s state-run energy operator Ukrenergo has said there is a \u201csignificant\u201d deficit in the country\u2019s energy system due to damage caused by Russian missile attacks. Ukraine\u2019s energy system had \u201csurvived\u201d 13 rocket attacks and 15 drone strikes from Russian forces, which had \u201ccaused significant damage to high-voltage facilities and power plants\u201d, it added. Ukraine\u2019s military will spend nearly $550m (\u00a3444m / \u20ac505m) on drones (UAVs) in 2023, and 16 supply deals have already been signed with Ukrainian manufacturers, defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said. Ukraine has received significant supplies of UAVs from its partners but Kyiv is now seeking to boost domestic production to build what officials cast as an \u201carmy of drones\u201d.   "

                    "body": "More than two-thirds of voters have backed the government intervening in the energy market to curb soaring power prices, after the Albanese government\u2019s first budget did little to ease widespread cost-of-living concerns. The latest Guardian Essential poll of 1,038 people, taken after Jim Chalmers\u2019 first budget, found pessimism about the economic outlook, with more than half of those surveyed (61%) bracing for the economy to worsen in the next 12 months. This was a 13% increase since June. The survey found almost half of all voters believed last week\u2019s budget would be \u201cbad or very bad\u201d for their personal circumstances, with just one in four people saying it would help with cost-of-living pressures. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who has been targeting the government over cost-of-living concerns, has lifted his positive rating from 23% in September to 29%, but still has a negative rating of 32%. Chalmers had a positive rating of 31% and a negative rating of 20%.  As the government flagged further intervention in the energy market as gas and electricity prices are expected to surge, the poll suggested most voters believed the government could do more. The budget papers revealed a 56% increase to electricity prices and a 44% increase to gas prices over the next two years, prompting Chalmers to promise greater intervention to ease the price pressures in the system. A total of 67% of those surveyed said they believed the government had the power to make a \u201cmeaningful difference\u201d on energy prices, with only 21% saying they could not, and another 12% unsure. When asked about what people believed were the drivers contributing to the 50% increase in energy prices revealed in the budget, 39% pointed to excessive profits by energy companies, while 38% blamed \u201cefforts to fight climate change, such as the shift towards renewable energy\u201d as either the most important or second most important factor. The war in Ukraine came in third, seen as the most important driver by 16% of people, with another 17% nominating it as the second most important factor. Older voters, women and Labor supporters were most likely to blame excessive profits by energy markets, while men and Coalition voters were more likely to nominate the shift to renewables.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  On Monday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the government would act \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d to do more, with expectations rising of a price trigger that would increase domestic gas supplies and a beefed-up role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The Essential survey found little confidence that the budget would ease cost-of-living concerns over the next few years. Just 25% of those polled believed the budget would probably provide relief \u2013 lower than the 33% who had some optimism on this measure after the Coalition\u2019s final budget in March. Older people were most pessimistic about the likelihood the budget would help them, with just 19% of those over the age of 55 expecting some reprieve, compared with 37% of young people who said the budget would \u201clikely\u201d help. More generally, the budget was seen to have few winners. Only 40% of those surveyed believe the budget would create jobs, down from 46% in April, while 36% said it will help Australia recover from the impact of Covid-19. More people than in April (53% to 51%) said the budget will place unnecessary burdens on future generations, despite more people thinking the Labor budget will keep debt under control more than the previous government.  The post election budget has captured less attention than budgets of the past several years, with 56% of people paying attention compared to about 65% over recent years. Those who consider themselves financially comfortable were more likely to pay attention (66%) than those who are experiencing serious financial difficulty (51%). After Chalmers spurned cost-of-living relief measures to try to slay the \u201cdragon\u201d of inflation, just 16% of people said the budget will be good for them personally, with 38% saying the budget is \u201cbad or very bad\u201d for their individual circumstances, and 37% being indifferent. The 38% negative rating is a nine percentage point fall since April, and 11% lower than the Covid budget delivered in late October 2020. People judged that the budget is bad or very bad for people on low incomes (40%), average working people (34%), older Australians (32%), younger Australians (27%) and the economy overall (32%). After a public debate over whether to keep the stage-three tax cuts \u2013 which the government has decided not to amend for the time being \u2013 the group seen as the most likely to benefit are people who are well off, with 42% of those surveyed suggesting the budget will be good for this group. Along with the lacklustre reception to the budget, the poll found a two percentage point dip in the positive rating of Albanese, with 45% of people giving him a positive rating of between 7 and 10, and 20% giving him a negative rating, up three percentage points. The change for both measures is within the +/-3% margin of error of the poll."

I\u2019m not of that school of thought that says you pack up and leave,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\n\nHawthorn and Kew, where Jess Wilson is running for the party after Smith was forced to resign following a drunken car crash, are considered vital to the Victorian Liberals, still reeling from their federal election rout.\nPesutto and Wilson, both self-described \u201csmall-l Liberals\u201d, are considered potential future leaders and there are fears that without them in the parliament the party will continue to narrow its base, hindering its ability to win elections.\n\nLike Frydenberg in Kooyong, they are competing against well-resourced and energised independent campaigns, endorsed by Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court\u2019s Climate 200 group, which also provided financial backing to Ryan in May.\nThe seats will go a long way to determining if the teal revolution at the federal poll represents a fundamental reimagining of the nation\u2019s political landscape, or was a one-off event caused by short-term factors.\nTeals and changing demographics\nMelissa Lowe, a Swinburne University manager, is running as an independent in Hawthorn, her campaign based out of the same former bank as Ryan\u2019s Kooyong headquarters. Once dubbed Mon HQ, it\u2019s been rebranded Mel HQ.\nLike Ryan, Lowe cites climate action, integrity and gender equality as her priorities ahead of the election, as well as more state-specific issues such as health, education and ending native logging.\n\n\u201cIndependents have helped invigorate democracy and that\u2019s fantastic for the communities they represent. But also, because I\u2019ve spent years working with young people, I believe we owe a lot to the future, we can do a lot better for them,\u201d Lowe says of her motivation to contest the seat.\nThe former Labor strategist and pollster Kos Samaras, whose RedBridge Group has performed work for Climate 200 and teal candidates both at a state and federal level, says Lowe will benefit from the changing demographics in the area.\nAccording to the 2021 census, the proportion of Hawthorn voters living in apartments had grown to 40.3% \u2013 well above the national average of 12.1%, while 36.1% of the electorate rents.\n\u201cWe know that young people are more likely to live in apartments, they\u2019re more likely to rent, and they\u2019re more likely to vote progressive,\u201d Samaras says.\nHe says the demographics in the suburbs of Hawthorn and Hawthorn East resemble the neighbouring electorate of Richmond, which has been a historically safe seat for Labor, though is increasingly marginal against the Greens.\n\nIt means Pesutto will need to rely on the support of older homeowners in Camberwell, Canterbury, Glen Iris and Surrey Hills to take hold of the seat.\n\u201cThis seat is going to continue to be a challenge for the party though until it finds something to attract younger voters. You can\u2019t be a conservative when you have nothing to conserve,\u201d Samaras says.\n\nSign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup\n\nIn Kew, Sophie Torney, a project manager, is running against Wilson. Her father, Ian Hancock, is considered to be the pre-eminent historian of the Liberal party but she describes herself as a swinging voter.\n\u201cHe and I don\u2019t have the same political views but he wants me to do well. I love that within families there are different viewpoints and democracies are better for robust debate,\u201d Torney says.\n\nKew covers the eastern parts of Kooyong, where support for Frydenberg remained strong at polling booths.\nIts residents are slightly more established than their Hawthorn neighbours and are more diverse \u2013 about a quarter have Chinese ancestry. Many newer residents have moved to the area to send their children to one of the 32 schools in the electorate, including the high-performing Balwyn and Kew high schools.\nSamaras says he expects to see a swing against the Liberals in the electorate, both due to the unpopularity of the current MP, Tim Smith, and their federal counterparts\u2019 hardline rhetoric against China, which also cost the party votes in May.\n\u201cSmith\u2019s negative satisfaction ratings are well into the 20s,\u201d Samaras says.\nBut there are also significant differences between the state and federal elections that could hinder the independents\u2019 chances, including laws in Victoria that cap political donations at $4,320 over a four-year period for a single donor.\nIt means independents cannot rely on large donations from the likes of Holmes \u00e0 Court, even though Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals have \u201cnominated entities\u201d they can access funds from, which are exempted from the cap.\n\nLowe says despite the limitations, she has still amassed $115,000 in donations and has the support of more than 200 volunteers. Almost 450 corflutes have been distributed at the time of writing \u2013 roughly one for every 70 homes in the electorate. Torney has received $165,000 in donations.\nLiberals focus on local matters\nBoth Pesutto and Wilson, meanwhile, were preselected in December and have been campaigning ever since.\nThe duo are pitching themselves very much as local candidates, who as members of a \u201cparty of government\u201d, can deliver on the services state governments are meant to provide.\nFor Pesutto, this means platform upgrades at Canterbury railway station, shelter for the #70 tram stop outside the Woolworths on Riversdale Road and fixing the plaster falling off the walls and the stench in the toilet block at Camberwell primary school.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be shocked and horrified if you saw the state of some of these schools,\u201d he says outside Glenferrie primary school in Hawthorn, which will benefit from a cash injection if he\u2019s elected.\nWilson, a former director of energy and climate at the Business Council of Australia and an adviser to Frydenberg, has similar commitments: changing the speed zone at Balwyn North Village, installing female change rooms at Myrtle Park and upgrading local shopping strips and public schools.\n\nShe cites health, cost of living and climate change as the issues most commonly raised by voters, although the sentiment on the ground is \u201cvery different\u201d to the federal election.\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t think that the Labor government deserves another term and they understand that the only way to change that is a Liberal government,\u201d Wilson says.\nLiberal campaign headquarters is also busy painting the independents as a \u201cpolitical party with a centralised structure\u201d, with support from Climate 200 and consistent policy positions. They have began distributing material headlined \u201ca vote for a Teal Party candidate will help re-elect Daniel Andrews\u201d.\nA similar attempt to tie the independent candidates to Anthony Albanese and the Labor party was evidently not successful at the federal election.\nPesutto blames the federal loss on the Morrison government\u2019s failure to act soon enough on climate change.\nThe situation \u201ccouldn\u2019t be any more different in Victoria\u201d, Pesutto is quick to add, with the Coalition committed to legislating an emissions reduction target of 50% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.\n\u201cIt\u2019s receiving a really good reception. People say to me, \u2018that\u2019s what we want from you, because now we can re-engage,\u2019\u201d he says.\nHawthorn\u2019s sitting Labor MP, John Kennedy, was not available for an interview with Guardian Australia, which visited the seat over several days in October.\nIn a response to emailed questions, he said he had \u201csecured vital investment for local schools, sport clubs, public housing and public transport infrastructure\u201d since being elected in 2018.\n\nThe two seats are not considered a priority for Labor but the 20-year-old Kew candidate Lucy Skelton, the founder of national youth advocacy platform the Student Voice Network, is putting up a fight.\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken six months off university to focus on the campaign, I don\u2019t have a mortgage, I don\u2019t have kids, I\u2019ve got the biggest safety blanket of any other candidate running, and because of this I can really give it my all,\u201d Skelton says, adding she has so far knocked on 10,000 doors.\nNeither Torney nor Wilson are keen to comment on the shadow of the current member on the campaign. But Skelton is more than happy to talk of the \u201cTim Smith effect\u201d.\n\u201cPeople just don\u2019t want a member they are embarrassed about,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s a view shared among Kew voters approached by Guardian Australia, including Kevin Kourambas, who says he has tried contacting Smith on several occasions but didn\u2019t get a response.\nKourambas will be voting for Torney as he believes both major parties are \u201ccorrupt\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of the Daniel Andrews government. Melbourne was the most liveable city in the world then we\u2019ve got him come in and we can build stations, we can build overpasses but we can\u2019t look after people, we can\u2019t get ambulances on time,\u201d he says.\n\u201cDuring Covid he was dictating what we should do, I had no control, no ability to use my own discretion about my safety.\u201d\nDr Paul Coombe, who also lives in Kew, says he supports Andrews\u2019 response to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cHe did what he had to do. Would the Coalition have done any better? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says.\nIn Hawthorn, Macy Hullick, is also dissatisfied with the major parties.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the candidates, I just know I don\u2019t want Daniel Andrews. I\u2019ll probably vote for the independent because the major parties don\u2019t seem to know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d the 22-year-old says.\nBut the overarching theme among voters in both seats is election fatigue, after being bombarded by federal campaign material.\nAnne Muirhead, of Hawthorn East, says she volunteered for the Ryan campaign in May but, following the win, stopped following politics closely.\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit politics weary,\u201d she says.\nThere\u2019s no doubt the Liberals are hoping the revolutionary fervour has ended."

At Azovstal. Given all the complexities of the process, the first evacuees will arrive in Zaporizhzhia tomorrow morning. Our team will meet them there. I hope that tomorrow all the necessary conditions will be met to continue the evacuation of people from Mariupol. We plan to start at 8 am.\n\n\n\n\n 11.44pm  \n\nYou can read a full report from my colleague Dominic Rushe on what\u2019s happening with the markets. One of the concerns is that the US Federal Reserve may have to riase interest rates more aggressively if inflation \u2013 currently 8.26% in the US and 9% in the UK \u2013 does not ease soon.\n\n\n\n\n 11.34pm  \n\nHello, I\u2019m Martin Farrer taking over from Maanvi.\nThe conflict in Ukraine is one of the reasons why the financial markets have got a bad case of the jitters in recent weeks. \nDespite some better days on stock markets this week, Wall Street has just endured a torrid session. The Dow Jones closed down 3.57% on Wednesday and the broader S&amp;P was off 4.04% _ its worst day since June 2020.\n\nInvestors pointed to concerns about growth in the US thanks to the threat to global prospects from the war in Ukraine, inflation and continued supply chain shocks from China lockdowns.\nFor example, this chart shows the UN\u2019s food and agricultural price index, in no small part thanks to Russia\u2019s Black Sea blockade preventing Ukrainian grain from going to market.\n\n\n\n\n 10.59pm  \nCatch up\n\n\nRussia says a further 694 Ukrainian troops have surrendered at Mariupol\u2019s besieged Azovstal steel plant in the past day, bringing the total number close to 1,000. The Russian defence ministry said 29 of the soldiers were wounded. The fate of the soldiers leaving the plant remains unclear, and it is also not clear how many remain inside.\n\n\nA Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a civilian on a bicycle, in Ukraine\u2019s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, has been accused of firing his AK-47 at a 62-year-old man from the window of a car in the north-eastern Sumy region in late February.\n\n\nSweden and Finland have formally submitted their applications to join the Nato military alliance. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, accepted the Nordic neighbours\u2019 membership applications. The United States will work with Finland and Sweden in the event of the \u2018threat of aggression\u2019 while the two countries\u2019 Nato membership is being considered, president Joe Biden said.\n\n\nTurkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said Sweden should not expect to approve its Nato application without returning \u2018terrorists\u2019. Ankara has accused Sweden and Finland of harbouring people it says are linked to groups it considers terrorists. A spokesperson for Erdo\u011fan later said progress on Finland and Sweden\u2019s Nato membership bids will only be possible if concrete steps are taken to address Turkey\u2019s national security concerns.\n\n\nThe European Commission has proposed an extra \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.6bn) in EU loans to Ukraine to keep the country running as well as a \u20ac210bn plan for Europe to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the \u20ac9bn support package would \u201chelp Ukraine win the war, overcome the consequences of Russian forces\u2019 aggression and accelerate the movement towards EU membership\u201d.\n\n\nRussia has expelled a total of 85 diplomatic staff from France, Spain and Italy in response to similar moves by those countries, its foreign ministry said. It said it was ordering out 34 embassy staff from France, 27 from Spain and 24 from Italy.\n\n\nThe US embassy in Kyiv has resumed operations, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said after nearly three months of closure. A small number of diplomats will return initially to staff the embassy, according to a spokesperson.\n\n\nRussian forces occupying parts of north-eastern Ukraine early in the war subjected civilians to summary executions, torture, and other grave abuses that are apparent war crimes, Human Rights Watch said. The rights organisation documented 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances and seven cases of torture across 17 villages and small towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions.\n\n\nAt least 10 Ukrainian civilians, including two children, were killed by Russian forces Donetsk, regional governor Pavlo Kirilenko said. A further seven people had been injured, he said.\n\n\nIn his nightly address, Zelenskiy said Russia\u2019s alleged use of laser weapons systems \u201cindicates the complete failure of the invasion\u201d. Russia has claimed it is using a new generation laser weapons to burn up drones. \n\n\u2013 L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong, Joanna Walters \n\n\n\n 10.38pm  \n\nIn his nightly address, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia\u2019s alleged use of laser weapons systems \u201cindicates the complete failure of the invasion\u201d.\nHe said: \n\nToday, one of the representatives of the Russian state said that the occupiers allegedly began to use laser weapons systems in Ukraine. Allegedly to save missiles.\nFirstly, it is noteworthy that they need to save missiles and somehow explain it. That is, more than two thousand missiles fired by the Russian army at Ukraine were the main part of their stockpile of missiles. That is, only the remnants are left.\nSecondly, everyone has already seen Russia at war. Inexperienced conscripts, which it throws into battle like cannon fodder. Marauders who see normal appliances for the first time in a foreign country. Old Soviet \u201carmor\u201d without modern protection. Forbidden phosphorous bombs, which they use to burn schools and ordinary houses.\nAnd missiles, most of which were spent by the Russian army on the destruction of absolutely civilian infrastructure without any strategic military outcome. Today they hit missiles in such a way at Mykolaiv and Dnipro.\nWell, in the propaganda of Nazi Germany there was such a term \u201cwunderwaffe\u201d. Wonder weapon. The clearer it became they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon, which would be so powerful that it would provide a turning point in the war.\nAnd here we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its \u201cwunderwaffe\u201d. Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion.\n\nRussia has said it is using a new generation laser weapons to burn up drones, according to Reuters. Per the agency: \n\nPresident Vladimir Putin in 2018 unveiled an array of new weapons including a new intercontinental ballistic missile, underwater nuclear drones, a supersonic weapon and a new laser weapon.\nLittle is known about the specifics of the new laser weapons. Putin mentioned one called Peresvet, named after a medieval Orthodox warrior monk Alexander Peresvet who perished in mortal combat.\nYury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told a conference in Moscow that Peresvet was already being widely deployed and it could blind satellites up to 1,500 km above Earth.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.39pm BST\n\n\n 9.54pm  \n\nThe US secretary of state, Tony Blinken, announced an additional $215m in food assistance to Ukraine.\n\u201cGiven the urgency of the crisis, we\u2019re announcing another $215m in new emergency food assistance, and we\u2019ll do much more,\u201d he said, while speaking at the United Nations. The US will also be allocating $500m to boost fertilizer production, and provide it for counties that previously imported fertilizer from Russia. \n\n\n\n 9.28pm  \nWhy has Erdo\u011fan doubled down on threat to veto Nordic Nato bids?\n\nAfter initial hesitation about the seriousness of Turkey\u2019s objections, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has doubled down on his threat to veto Finland\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s applications for membership of Nato, saying there is no point in either country sending delegations to Ankara to persuade him otherwise.\nOn Wednesday, he also extended his demands from the two he outlined on Monday to 10, leading to claims that he is using blackmail.\nAt his press conference on Monday, he made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria.\nNo one doubts that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s intervention could tangle Nato up in knots for months. It is now the task of alliance diplomats to establish Erdo\u011fan\u2019s seriousness and the price that would have to be paid to make him back down, and prevent a full-blown Nato crisis.\nThe Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, initially hoped that something had got lost in translation after she had been quoted in the Turkish press saying the Turks regard all Kurds as terrorists. Linde said on Sunday she had never made these remarks, had never met the PKK, and would not do so.\nShe was cautiously optimistic that any misunderstanding could be cleared up, but by Wednesday it was clear her reassurances were falling short of what Erdo\u011fan requires.\nThe Nordic political class initially appeared sceptical about Erdo\u011fan\u2019s seriousness. Finland\u2019s president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, said he spoke with Erdo\u011fan a month ago and none of his current concerns were aired. It was also being said that no early warning flares were sent up by Turkey\u2019s Nato ambassador, Basat \u00d6zt\u00fcrk.\nBut that assessment is changing. Jonathan Eyal, the associate director of the Rusi thinktank, said Erdo\u011fan \u201clives on the edge and operates through brinkmanship\u201d.\nEyal added: \u201cMany of his demands about the PKK are part of a familiar Turkish tune. But he has domestic reasons to be standing up to America. The economy is in tatters and his popularity is at an all time low.\u201d\nWith inflation at 66.9% and facing elections next summer, there is no harm galvanising the nationalist vote, but that is not to say Erdo\u011fan\u2019s complaints are entirely synthetic.\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n 9.06pm  \n\nAn interesting graphic of the war in Ukraine so far, showing Russian advances followed by retreats, and the areas where the invading Russian forces are solidly in control at this point.\nThe map has been tweeted out by a project within the US conservative think-tank the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, FYI.\nIt also takes a couple of views to be able to absorb the different codes and colour schemes. But it is still a useful visual.\n\n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\nAt least 10 Ukrainian civilians, including two children, were killed by Russian forces in the eastern region of Donetsk on Wednesday, regional governor Pavlo Kirilenko said in an online message, Reuters reports.\nKirilenko, who did not give details, said a further seven people had been injured.\nMeanwhile, in Moscow, this:\n\n\n\n\n 8.04pm  \n\nSome interesting new images and clips coming out from south-eastern Ukraine on the home country\u2019s efforts there to continue to combat the Russian invasion, and the price being paid.\nFirst the destruction of a bridge outside of Severodonetsk by Ukrainian forces, among many sabotage events to slow Russia\u2019s military machine.\n\nThen the aftermath of a Russian airstrike in Bakhmut that took five Ukrainian civilian lives, according to Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nAnd here is some footage of Russian MI-35M combat helicopters in action in eastern Ukraine, although the exact location and context are not clear.\n\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \n\nJoe Biden said on Wednesday he thought the bids by Sweden and Finland to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) would be successful, despite objections raised by Turkey to their applications.\nThe US president answered some reporters questions while he was at Joint Base Andrews, the military air base just outside Washington, DC, to which the president is often transported by the Marine One helicopter before boarding Air Force One for official trips.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna say one thing ... I got a call months ago from the president of Finland, wanted to come and see me, I saw him, he told me what he was thinking about. And I got a call that both the leader of Finland and Sweden are coming to see me on Thursday. I think we\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d\nFrom that slightly cryptic remark came a reporter\u2019s follow-up.\n\u201cCan you convince Turkey?\u201d in terms of the Nordic countries\u2019 admissions to the US-led military defence alliance.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to Turkey, but I think we\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d he said.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.01pm BST\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\nThe US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, has announced that the Senate will likely approve on Thursday the $40bn (\u00a332bn) bill for providing funds for the war in Ukraine.\nThe funds include a mix of military and humanitarian aid. The bill was expected to be passed by the Senate last week, having been passed by the House with bipartisan support. But the Kentucky Republican and libertarian gadfly Rand Paul blocked the bill.\nOn Wednesday, Schumer took a moment to chastise Paul for being the only lawmaker to object to the passage of the aid package.\n\u201cThis should already have been done and over with,\u201d Schumer said.\n\u201cBut it is repugnant that one member of the other side, the junior senator from Kentucky, chose to make a show and obstruct Ukraine funding knowing full well he couldn\u2019t actually stop its passage. For senator Paul to delay Ukraine funding for purely political motives is to only strengthen Putin\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nThe national security advisor Jake Sullivan said in a live media briefing in Washington there was \u201ca chorus\u201d of support for the aid package.\n\nUpdated at 7.36pm BST\n\n\n 7.00pm  \nSummary\n\nIt is 9pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:\n\nRussia says a further 694 Ukrainian troops have surrendered at Mariupol\u2019s besieged Azovstal steel plant in the past day, bringing the total number close to 1,000. The Russian defence ministry said 29 of the soldiers were wounded. The fate of the soldiers leaving the plant remains unclear, and it is also not clear how many remain inside.\n\n\nA Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a civilian on a bicycle, in Ukraine\u2019s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion.

Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the \u20ac9bn support package would \u201chelp Ukraine win the war, overcome the consequences of Russian forces\u2019 aggression and accelerate the movement towards EU membership\u201d.\n\n\nRussia has expelled a total of 85 diplomatic staff from France, Spain and Italy in response to similar moves by those countries, its foreign ministry said.

Ukraine\u2019s negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Thursday that peace talks with Russia had been suspended, blaming Moscow for failing to understand that the war is \u201cno longer taking place according to its rules, its timetable, or its plans\u201d.\n\n\nA Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a civilian on a bicycle, in Ukraine\u2019s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion.

The EU has already provided \u20ac4.1bn to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, including military aid.\n\nThe EU will continue to provide \u201cshort-term financial support to Ukraine to meet its needs and basic services running\u201d, said the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, adding:\n\nWe stand ready to take a leading role in the international reconstruction efforts to help rebuild a democratic and prosperous Ukraine. This means investments will go hand-in-hand with reforms that will support Ukraine in pursuing its European path.\n\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was grateful for the support package, adding that it would \u201chelp Ukraine win the war, overcome the consequences of Russian forces\u2019 aggression and accelerate the movement towards EU membership\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission also unveiled a \u20ac210bn plan for Europe to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027.\nThe plan includes importing gas supplies from non-Russian countries, switching to renewable every, and more effort to save energy.\nThe measures are expected to require \u20ac210bn in extra investments by 2027 and \u20ac300bn by 2030, on top of those already needed to meet the EU\u2019s 2030 climate target. \n\nUpdated at 4.32pm BST\n\n\n 3.16pm  \n\nEmma Graham-Harrison has the full report that a Russian soldier has pleaded guilty in the first Ukraine war crimes trial since the start of the invasion: \nA Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a civilian on a bicycle, in Ukraine\u2019s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion.\nVadim Shysimarin, 21, sat emotionless as prosecutors detailed charges that he had fired his AK-47 at a 62 year-old man from the window of a car in the north-eastern Sumy region in late February.\nHis commander allegedly told him to kill the man, an unarmed civilian, because he worried the victim might give away the position of Russian forces.\nThe court, presided over by three judges, will still hear testimony from witnesses including the victim\u2019s wife and another Russian soldier who was in the car with Shysimarin, before confirming the verdict and handing down a sentence.\nProsecutors have moved fast. It is extremely unusual to hold a trial while a conflict is still ongoing, and unprecedented to do it within weeks. The victim was shot dead less than three months ago, in the first days after the invasion.\n\nUkrainian authorities say justice for atrocities committed by Russian forces is a priority, with investigators at times even risking their lives in areas still laced with mines or threatened by Russian forces to collect evidence that could help secure convictions.\nThey have the support of several teams of international investigators and forensic experts, but face a mammoth task. Hundreds of civilians were killed just in the parts of Ukraine that have been liberated from Russian forces, and dozens of rapes have been reported.\nAlready Ukraine\u2019s prosector general has registered more than 11,000 war crimes, which have included attacks on hospitals. Large swathes of Ukrainian territory are still under Russian control, so the toll is expected to rise considerably if those areas can be reached.\nShysimarin, who comes from Ust Illyinsk in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia, was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division at the time of the killing, which happened on 28 February in Chupakhivka village.\nProsecutors say he shot at a car after his convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away with four other soldiers. He then used an AK-47 to shoot the unarmed man, just a few dozen metres from his home.\nThe man was speaking on his phone and Shysimarin was ordered \u201cto kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders\u201d, according to prosecutors.\nRead Emma Graham-Harrison\u2019s full article here.\n\n\n\n\n 2.59pm  \n\nRussian authorities have seized Google Russia\u2019s bank account, making it impossible for its Russian office to function, a Google spokesperson said.\nThe US tech giant\u2019s Russian subsidiary has declared its intention to file for bankruptcy, Reuters reports. It comes after months of pressure from authorities for failing to delete content Moscow deems illegal and for restricting access to some Russian media on YouTube.\nA spokesperson for Google said:\n\nThe Russian authorities seizure of Google Russia\u2019s bank account has made it untenable for our Russia office to function, including employing and paying Russia-based employees, paying suppliers and vendors, and meeting other financial obligations.\nGoogle Russia has published a notice of its intention to file for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n 2.52pm  \n\nThe Russian defence ministry has issued footage showing what it says are Ukrainian fighters from the Azovstal steel plant surrendering, getting searched by Russian forces and being loaded into ambulances.\n\n\n\n\n 2.40pm  \n\nThe US treasury secretary Janet Yellen has claimed that sanctions against Russia have already had an enormous impact on the economy.\n\u201cRussia is experiencing recession, high inflation, acute challenges in their financial system, and the inability to procure the material and products they need to support their war or their economy,\u201d Reuters reports Yellen told the media ahead of a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Bonn, Germany.\n\n\n\n 2.37pm  \n\nIt is a sideshow to developments in Ukraine, but the organisers of Formula One have announced that the Russian Grand Prix will not be replaced on this year\u2019s calendar.

It did not say where the soldiers would be sent, though on Tuesday evening Reuters reported that seven buses carrying Ukrainian soldiers left the plant for a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka in a Russian-controlled area of Donetsk region.\nUkraine has not commented on Russia\u2019s latest update. In his address to the nation late on Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said an \u201cevacuation mission\u201d was continuing with help from \u201cthe most influential international mediators\u201d.\nThe fate of the soldiers leaving the plant remains unclear, and it is also not clear how many remain inside.\nDenis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, said on Wednesday that the \u201ccommanders of the highest level\u201d were still hiding in the plant. Earlier, Ukrainian officials had said some of its soldiers remained.\nThe two sides in the war have released practically no details of the agreement that led to the surrender of the troops, who were holed up for weeks in an extensive network of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks.\nUkraine\u2019s deputy defence minister said on Tuesday that the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but a number of Russian officials on Wednesday repeated statements made a day earlier by other hardliners that the soldiers should be tried. Pushilin on Wednesday called on an \u201cinternational tribunal\u201d to be set to decide the soldiers\u2019 \u201cfate\u201d.\n\u201cAs for war criminals as well as those who are nationalists, their fate, if they laid down their arms, should be decided by the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the enemy has laid down arms, then his fate will be decided by the courts.

Supporters of the invasion have also used the sign.\n\n\u201cMr Kuliak breached the FIG statutes, the FIG code of discipline, the FIG code of ethics, the FIG code of conduct and the FIG technical regulations when he wore the letter \u2018Z\u2019 on his singlet,\u201d the governing body said in a statement. \u201c[He] is not allowed to participate in any FIG-sanctioned event or competition organised by an affiliated FIG member federation for one year as of the date of this decision.\u201d\nKuliak was unrepentant about the display and claimed that he would always stand for peace. \u201cI saw it with our military and looked at what this symbol means. It turned out [it means], \u2018for victory\u2019 and \u2018for peace,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t wish anything bad on anyone, I just showed my position.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.47pm BST\n\n\n 1.37pm  \n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry said 27 Spanish diplomats must leave Russia within a week, taking today\u2019s number of European expulsions to 85.\nIt comes after the ministry said it was kicking out 34 diplomatic staff from France and 24 from Italy in response to similar moves by those countries.\nLast month, Russia expelled 45 Polish diplomats and 40 Germans, as well as announcing tit-for-tat moves against Finland, Romania, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Japan, among others. \n\n\n\n 1.11pm  \nRussian soldier on trial for war crimes pleads guilty to killing civilian\n\nThe first Russian soldier on trial for war crimes in Ukraine during Moscow\u2019s invasion has pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed civilian.\nVadim Shishimarin, 21, appeared at Kyiv\u2019s Solomyansky district court charged with war crimes and premeditated murder. \nShishimarin is accused of killing an unarmed civilian, a 62-year-old man in the northeast Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February.\nAsked in court if he was guilty of the allegations, including war crimes and premeditated murder, Shishimarin responded \u201cyes\u201d. If convicted, he faces up to life imprisonment.\nUkraine\u2019s state prosecutors said Shishimarin \u2013 a sergeant from the Siberian region of Irkutsk \u2013 and four other Russian servicemen fired at and stole a privately owned car to escape after their column was targeted by Ukrainian forces.\nThe soldiers drove into the village of Chupakhivka where they saw an unarmed 62-year-old man riding a bicycle and talking on his phone, they said.\nProsecutors said Shishimarin was ordered by another serviceman to kill the civilian to prevent him from reporting on the Russians\u2019 presence. Using a Kalashnikov assault rifle, he fired several shots through the open window of the car at the civilian\u2019s head, they said. The civilian died on the spot. \n\nIt is the first war crimes trial since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. \n\nUpdated at 1.29pm BST\n\n\n 1.04pm  \n\nItaly\u2019s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said Rome strongly supports Finland\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s Nato applications and is willing to speed up any internal procedures so the two countries can join the alliance as soon as possible.\nSpeaking to reporters following a meeting with Finland\u2019s prime minister, Sanna Marin, Draghi said:\n\nThe application for Nato membership is a clear response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the threat it poses to peace in Europe, to our collective security.\n\nDraghi also described Russia\u2019s decision to expel 24 Italian diplomats as an \u201chostile act\u201d, adding that diplomatic channels with Moscow should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d be interrupted.\nFinland\u2019s Marin told reporters that a fast ratification of membership would be the \u201cbest security guarantee for Finland and for Sweden at this stage\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s some more reaction to the news that Sweden and Finland have formally applied to join Nato. Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said Nato will be \u201cstronger\u201d with Nordic countries as members, adding that the security landscape in Europe \u201chas fundamentally changed\u201d.\n\nPortugal\u2019s prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, said both Finland and Sweden\u2019s applications have been welcomed \u201cwith optimism and confidence\u201d.\n\nBritain\u2019s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the UK would work to integrate Finland and Sweden quickly.\n\nAnd Germany\u2019s justice minister, Marco Buschmann, said the German cabinet has approved Finland and Sweden\u2019s request to join Nato and that it was \u201ccommitted to a fast accession process\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n 12.21pm  \nErdo\u011fan: Turkey will not approve Sweden's Nato bid unless 'terrorists' returned\n\nTurkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said Sweden should not expect to approve its Nato application without returning \u201cterrorists\u201d, Reuters reports.\nSwedish and Finnish delegations should not come to Turkey to convince it to support their bids to join the alliance, Erdo\u011fan said in a speech to lawmakers from his ruling AK party. \nErdo\u011fan said:\n\nWe have such a sensitivity as protecting our borders from attacks by terrorists organisations.\nNato expansion is only meaningful for us in proportion to the respect that will be shown to our sensitivities.\n\nTurkey has accused Sweden and Finland of harbouring people it says are linked to groups it considers terrorists, including the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) militant group and followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt.\n\nOn Monday, Turkey\u2019s state broadcaster TRT Haber said Sweden and Finland had not granted approval for the repatriation of 33 people that Turkey requested.\nErdo\u011fan added:\n\nSo you won\u2019t give us back terrorists but you ask us for Nato membership? Nato is an entity for security, an organisation for security. \nTherefore, we cannot say \u2018yes\u2019 to this security organisation being deprived of security.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.59pm BST\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\nSome more expulsions have just been announced: Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said it is kicking out 24 Italian diplomats in a retaliatory move, the Russian state-owned news agency Ria reports.\nLast month, Italy expelled 30 Russians as part of a coordinated European operation to send Russian diplomats home. \n\n\n\n 11.55am  \n\nRussia has expelled 34 French diplomats and staff in a retaliatory move, its foreign ministry said.\nIn response, the French foreign affairs ministry condemned Russia\u2019s decision to kick its staff out of the Moscow embassy. \nLast month, France expelled 35 Russians with diplomatic status as part of a wave of expulsions that saw more than 300 Russians kicked out of European capitals.\nLater that month, the French foreign ministry declared six Russian agents posing as diplomats as \u201cpersona non grata\u201d after an intelligence investigation concluded they were working against France\u2019s national interests.\n\n\n\n 11.45am  \n\nThe UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he is looking forward to welcoming Finland and Sweden into Nato, just hours after both Nordic countries formally submitted their applications to join the military alliance.\nJohnson tweeted that it was a \u201chistoric\u201d day and said Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, had \u201ctransformed the geopolitical contours of our continent\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n 11.35am  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.25am  \nMore than 28,000 Russian troops killed so far, says Ukraine\n\nAbout 28,300 Russian troops have been killed since troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, according to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.\nIn an update posted on its Facebook page, the general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said Russia had lost 400 more personnel over the past day.\nIn addition, it said Russia had also lost 1,251 tanks, 3,043 armoured vehicles, 586 artillery systems, 199 multiple launch rocket systems, 91 air defence systems, 202 warplanes and 13 warships and boats. \n\nHello, it is L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong taking over from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine.

The numbers have not been independently verified.\nDenis Pushilin, who is head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, has told local media a court would decide the fate of the Ukrainian fighters who had surrendered at Azovstal.\nRussia claims they have killed 270 Ukrainian fighters and \u201c54 units of military equipment were disabled\u201d overnight. They also claim to have shot down two planes and 15 drones.\nThe State Emergency Service of Ukraine have issued their latest daily update saying that yesterday they neutralised 685 explosive devices on Ukrainian soil. \nThe latest intelligence update from the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence highlights Russia\u2019s \u201csignificant resourcing problems in Ukraine\u201d, which it says \u201cis likely contributing to a disunited command which continues to hamper Russia\u2019s operations\u201d.\nVadim Shishimarin, 21, will appear at Kyiv\u2019s Solomyansky district court from 2pm local time, charged with war crimes and premeditated murder, over the death of a 62-year-old man in north-eastern Ukraine on 28 February.\nThe international criminal court on Tuesday sent a 42-member team to Ukraine to investigate alleged war crimes since the Russian invasion in what it called the largest such deployment in its history.\nThe US will create a new unit to research, document and publicise alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. The Conflict Observatory will \u201ccapture, analyse, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine\u201d, the US state department said.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that there was no movement in peace talks with Ukraine, and claimed that Kyiv was showing a total unwillingness to continue them.\nIsrael says it has delivered 2,000 helmets and 500 protective vests for emergency and civilian use in Ukraine.\nThe UK\u2019s foreign secretary Liz Truss has said the UK is open to the idea of an international criminal tribunal trying Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders over the war in Ukraine.\nAustrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg told German radio broadcaster Deutschlandfunk his country would stay militarily neutral. \u201cThe situation for us looks a little different,\u201d he said when asked about Sweden and Finland applying to join Nato.\n\nThat is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong will be on the live blog for the next few hours.\n\nUpdated at 11.21am BST\n\n\n 10.55am  \n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that there was no movement in peace talks with Ukraine, and claimed that Kyiv was showing a total unwillingness to continue them.\n\u201cNegotiations are not progressing and we note the complete unwillingness of Ukrainian negotiators to continue this process\u201d, Reuters reports Peskov said.\nIn the past, Peskov has said that reports Russia intended to invade Ukraine were a \u201chollow and unfounded\u201d invention of the western media, and in February he said that Russian troops would be \u201cpulled back to their permanent bases\u201d after the conclusion of joint military drills with Belarus.\nYesterday, Interfax news agency cited Russian deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko as saying that Russia and Ukraine were not holding talks \u201cin any form\u201d, and that Kyiv had \u201cpractically withdrawn from the negotiation process\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 11.21am BST\n\n\n 10.24am  \n\nDenis Pushilin, who is head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk in Ukraine, has been quoted by Reuters, citing local media, as saying a court would decide the fate of the Ukrainian fighters who had surrendered at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. \nThe status of the fighters remains unclear, as there are moves in the Russian State Duma to treat the Azov Battalian as a terrorist organisation, which would then call into question whether Russia would feel obliged to treat those who surrendered at Azovstal as prisoners of war.\n\nUpdated at 10.30am BST\n\n\n 9.43am  \n\nThe UK\u2019s foreign secretary Liz Truss has said the UK is open to the idea of an international criminal tribunal trying Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders over the war in Ukraine. PA Media quotes her telling Times Radio:\n\nWe are very clear that Putin and all of those who\u2019ve been behind the appalling war crimes that are being committed in Ukraine need to be held to account, and we\u2019re working very closely with the international criminal court.\nWe\u2019ve sent support into Ukraine to help collect evidence, from witness statements to video evidence.\nI\u2019ve talked to the Ukrainian government about this idea of a tribunal. We are open to the idea of a tribunal, we\u2019re currently considering it, but what we want is the most effective way of prosecuting those people who have committed these appalling war crimes including rape, sexual violence, the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\nIf the tribunal will help to do that, then the UK is definitely considering supporting it.\n\n\n\n\n 9.40am  \n\nThe decision of Sweden and Finland to apply for Nato membership has raised questions for other European countries who maintain a neutral stance. The foreign minister of Austria has said this morning his country would retain its neutral status.\n\u201cThe situation for us looks a little different,\u201d Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg told German radio broadcaster Deutschlandfunk, Reuters reports, pointing to \u201coverwhelming\u201d public support for neutrality in Austria.\nSchallenberg said that the country, which obtains 80% of its natural gas from Russia, would continue to provide humanitarian support to Ukraine rather than lethal weapons.\n\u201cWe are helping on a large scale but not with war munition and I think help for Ukraine cannot only be reduced to war munition,\u201d he told the broadcaster.\n\n\n\n 9.12am  \n\nReuters has a quick snap that Israel says it has delivered 2,000 helmets and 500 protective vests for emergency and civilian use.\n\n\n\n 9.10am  \nRussia claims 694 Ukrainian fighters surrendered at Azovstal in last 24 hours\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry has issued its latest operation briefing. \nIt says that a total of 959 combatants have surrendered from the Azovstal steel plant since Monday. It said that 694 Ukrainian fighters who had been under siege surrendered over the last 24 hours. Russia says that in total 80 of those who surrendered were wounded, of whom 51 have been taken to hospital.\nIn addition, the Russians claim that they have killed 270 Ukrainian fighters and \u201c54 units of military equipment were disabled\u201d overnight. They also claim to have shot down two planes and 15 drones.\nThe claims have not been independently verified.\n\nUpdated at 10.19am BST\n\n\n 8.49am  \n\nRussia\u2019s ministry of defence has issued a statement on Telegram saying it has been requested by the investigative committee of Russia to provide information on \u201cthe illegal actions of Ukrainian armed formations related to the use of civilian objects for military purposes\u201d.\nWithout providing evidence, it claims \u201cthe Azov Battalion used the buildings of kindergartens and schools to equip barracks\u201d and that members of the \u2018Aidar\u2019 battalion also \u201cequip firing positions in places not intended for this, creating a real danger to the civilian population\u201d.\nThe Russian ministry of defence also claims that in the Dnepropetrovsk region, Ukrainian forces set up military operations in hospitals and that \u201cthe staff and patients of medical facilities are being held as human shields\u201d.\nThe statement concludes: \u201cAs part of the criminal cases under investigation, the investigative committee will record this information and continue to establish all the circumstances of the incident, as well as the Ukrainian security forces involved in this.\u201d\nRussia has repeatedly denied making targets of civilians and civilian infrastructure during the latest invasion of Ukraine, which they have termed a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\nAsked previously about allegations of war crimes committed by Ukrainian forces, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko stated last month that \u201ceach and every incident will be investigated\u201d.\nThe office of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, has said allegations of more than 10,700 crimes by Russian forces have been registered since the war began. Vadim Shysimarin appeared at Kyiv\u2019s district court last week accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian.\n\nUpdated at 10.21am BST\n\n\n 8.02am  \n\nThe UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has been doing the media round in the UK today, and on Times Radio she has said that Russian assets seized in Britain could be used to help pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine.\n\u201cWe will, of course, work to make sure that Russia has to contribute to the rebuilding of Ukraine,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n 7.45am  \n\nSerhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, has posted to Telegram that there will be an evacuation train from Pokrovsk at 4.30pm this afternoon to carry people out of eastern Ukraine to Lviv, as attempts to provide routes across the country for those who wish to flee continue.\n\n\n\n 7.20am  \n\nThe State Emergency Service of Ukraine have issued their latest daily update saying that yesterday they neutralised 685 explosive devices on Ukrainian soil. They say that the total number of munitions dealt with since Russia\u2019s latest invasion began on 24 February has reached 110,593 explosive devices.\n\n\n\n 7.13am  \n\nThomas Meaney is a fellow at the Max Planck Society in G\u00f6ttingen, and he writes for us today saying Finland and Sweden may join Nato \u2013 but even they can\u2019t guarantee that will make them safer:\nWhether Finland and Sweden will actually be safer in Nato is another question. Their declarations have only drawn a mild rebuke from the Kremlin, which has warned against a military buildup in both countries. Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime has never suggested the possibility of hostilities against either country, with which it has consistently enjoyed cordial relations. Memories of past Russian-Finnish military confrontations suggest that anyone thinking about an incursion into Finland should consider medical treatment.\nOne sensitive point in the Finland-Nato question is that Russians make up the largest minority in Finland. Their main representative organisation has made it clear that it can resolve any of its political issues through the procedures of Finnish politics. But some Finnish officials fear Putin could still use Russian grievances inside Finland as a pretext for hostilities. \nRead more here: Thomas Meaney \u2013 Finland and Sweden may join Nato: but even they can\u2019t guarantee that will make them safer\n\n\n\n\n 6.18am  \n\nEvacuation of soldiers from the Azovstal steelworks\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.42am BST\n\n\n 6.00am  \nUK Ministry of Defence highlights Russia\u2019s 'significant resourcing problems'\n\nThe latest intelligence update from the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence highlights Russia\u2019s \u201csignificant resourcing problems in Ukraine\u201d, which it says \u201cis likely contributing to a disunited command which continues to hamper Russia\u2019s operations\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.27am BST\n\n\n 5.46am  \n\nThe fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory.\nUkraine\u2019s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said on Tuesday they could be tried and even executed. MPs in Russia\u2019s State Duma said they would propose new laws that could derail prisoner exchanges of fighters who Moscow claims are \u201cterrorists\u201d.\nRussian investigators have said they plan to interrogate the soldiers and could charge them with \u201ccrimes committed by the Ukrainian regime against the civilian population in south-east Ukraine\u201d.\nOn Tuesday evening, seven buses carrying Ukrainian soldiers left the Azovstal plant in the port city and arrived at a former prison colony in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka in Donetsk, Reuters reported.\nFull story here.\n\n\n\n 5.28am  \n\nHere\u2019s more on the war crimes trial due to kick off today.\nVadim Shishimarin, 21, will appear at Kyiv\u2019s Solomyansky district court from 2:00 pm (1100 GMT), charged with war crimes and premeditated murder, over the death of a 62-year-old man in northeastern Ukraine on February 28.\nThe soldier from Irkutsk in Siberia faces a possible life sentence.\n\u201cHe understands what he is being accused of,\u201d his lawyer Viktor Ovsiannikov told AFP, without revealing the case for the defence.\nUkrainian authorities say he is cooperating with investigators and admitting the facts of the incident which came just four days after the Russian invasion began.\nProsecutors said Shishimarin was commanding a unit in a tank division when his convoy came under attack.\nHe and four other soldiers stole a car, and as they were travelling near the village of Shupakhivka in the Sumy region, they encountered a 62-year-old man on a bicycle.\n\u201cOne of the soldiers ordered the accused to kill the civilian so that he would not denounce them,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said.\nShishimarin then fired a Kalashnikov assault rifle from the window of the vehicle and \u201cthe man died instantly, a few dozen metres from his home\u201d, they added in a statement.\n\nIn early May, Ukrainian authorities announced his arrest without giving details, while publishing a video in which Shishimarin said he had come to fight in Ukraine to \u201csupport his mother financially\u201d.\nHe explained his actions saying: \u201cI was ordered to shoot, I shot him once. He fell and we continued our journey.\u201d\nHis lawyer said the case was proving challenging. \u201cThis is the first such case in Ukraine with such an indictment. There is no relevant legal practice or verdicts on such cases. We will sort it out,\u201d he said.\nUkraine\u2019s chief prosecutor Iryna Venediktova underlined the importance of the case for her country in a series of tweets.\n\u201cWe have over 11,000 ongoing cases of war crimes and already 40 suspects,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBy this first trial, we are sending a clear signal that every perpetrator, every person who ordered or assisted in the commission of crimes in Ukraine shall not avoid responsibility.\u201d\nTwo Russian servicemen are due to go on trial from Thursday for firing rockets at civilian infrastructure in the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nUpdated at 5.47am BST\n\n\n 5.16am  \n\nHello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Ukraine crisis. \nThe big news today is that the first war crimes trial since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will begin in Kyiv. It is against a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed civilian, a 62-year-old man in northeastern Ukraine, in the days after the invasion began.\nThe trial, expected to be followed by several others, will test the Ukrainian justice system at a time when international institutions are also conducting their own investigations into abuses committed by Russian forces.\nVadim Shishimarin, 21, will appear at Kyiv\u2019s Solomyansky district court charged with war crimes and premeditated murder, the soldier from Irkutsk in Siberia faces a possible life sentence.\nHere is what else you need to know:\n\nThe international criminal court on Tuesday sent a 42-member team to Ukraine to probe alleged war crimes since the Russian invasion in what it called the largest such deployment in its history.\nThe US will create a new unit to research, document and publicise alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. The Conflict Observatory will \u201ccapture, analyse, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,\u201d the US state department said.\nPeace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have stagnated, officials said on Tuesday, with both sides trading blame and Moscow indicating a return to talks may be difficult. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he believed no peace deal can be made if negotiators try to \u201ctransfer the dialogue\u201d to focus on what the west had to say instead of the immediate situation in Ukraine. That ruled out chances for progress in talks, he added. \u201cWe always say that we are ready for negotiations ... but we were given no other choice,\u201d Lavrov said.\nThe fate of more than 260 Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said they could be tried or even executed.\nEight people have died and 12 were wounded after Russia launched a missile strike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Ukraine\u2019s state emergency service. The regional governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russia launched four missiles at around 5am local time on Tuesday. Two of the missiles hit buildings in the village, he said.\nA village in Russia\u2019s western province of Kursk bordering Ukraine came under Ukrainian fire, the regional governor said, but there were no injuries.\n\n\nFinland and Sweden announced they will submit their bids to join Nato together, despite Turkey\u2019s threat to block the military alliance\u2019s expansion. Finland\u2019s parliament overwhelmingly approved a government proposal to join Nato, a day after Sweden confirmed its intention to join the alliance. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, said he was sure both countries would overcome Turkish opposition to their historic membership bids.\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said that Europe risked paying the most expensive energy prices in the world by abandoning Russian energy supplies. Speaking at a meeting with domestic oil managers and government officials, Putin said it was impossible for some European countries to quickly ditch Russian oil.\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy gave a surprise address to open the Cannes Film Festival in France. Over video, Zelensky said that \u201cit\u2019s necessary for cinema not to be silent\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll be blogging throughout the day, so keep following as we bring you the news as it breaks.\n\n"

                    "body": "  6.54pm    We are now closing the blog. Here is a summary of today\u2019s events:  Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv\u2019s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak\u2019s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine\u2019s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine\u2019s general staff. He said Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would make the total public \u201cwhen the right moment comes\u201d. Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said.  Vladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. European Union member states have agreed to put a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian oil after Poland, which was holding out, gave the green light to the deal. In an effort to reduce the Kremlin\u2019s income from fossil fuels, the EU has agreed to limit the amount that can be paid for seaborne oil to diminish Moscow\u2019s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country\u2019s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers\u2019 organisation PEN. Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. The Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe\u2019s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s electricity before Russia\u2019s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported. The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has suggested. This threat is likely to have prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report states. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a \u00a3580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP\u2019s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country. The Archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be \u201cno way we force peace\u201d in Ukraine. Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be \u201cvery long term\u201d, the Press Association reported. US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he\u2019s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn\u2019t done that yet,\u201d Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday. Biden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for \u201cwidely documented atrocities and war crimes\u201d in Ukraine. Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression. In a joint statement, the leaders said: \u201cIntentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d   Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed.      6.47pm     Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June this year, the Scottish Government has confirmed. MS Victoria, which is docked in Leith, Edinburgh, will continue to provide \u201csafe accommodation for displaced people\u201d until June 2023 with the option to extend. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, however, accused the Scottish Government of \u201cquietly\u201d extending the contract, according to reports by LBC on Friday. On Friday evening, Mr Cole-Hamilton told the PA news agency:   This isn\u2019t a new life, it\u2019s a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution. I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish Government as being humiliatingly underprepared. They wanted the kudos of throwing open their doors but they did none of the groundwork. I don\u2019t think when these Ukrainians are fleeing unimaginable atrocities at the hands of the Russians, I don\u2019t think they dreamed about a very crowded passenger ship.\u201d  Appropriate long-term accommodation is yet to be identified. Minister with Special Responsibility for Refugees from Ukraine Neil Gray said:  We do not want people to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary in temporary welcome accommodation, however, we know from speaking to those on board the MS Victoria that it is a safe environment that has built a powerful sense of community. We\u2019ve extended the contract with the MS Victoria to continue to safely accommodate arrivals from Ukraine. Work continues to match people in temporary accommodation with hosts and matching teams are operating on board both ships.\u201d       6.32pm    European Union member states have agreed to put a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian oil after Poland, which was holding out, gave the green light to the deal. In an effort to reduce the Kremlin\u2019s income from fossil fuels, the EU has agreed to limit the amount that can be paid for seaborne oil to diminish Moscow\u2019s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The price cap also aims to avert a surge in global oil prices after the EU\u2019s embargo on Russian crude takes effect on 5 December. Warsaw had held out on approving the deal in order to examine an adjustment mechanism to keep the cap below the market price \u2013 having pushed in negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible. Poland\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Andrzej Sado\u015b, said on Friday that the mechanism in the final deal would keep the price cap at least 5% below the market rate. However, security experts from the CSIS thinktank have suggested a cap at $60 is toothless since it is above the price of existing Russian oil prices of about $52 a barrel. It has been estimated that Russian oil is sold at a profit from $40-45 a barrel, but Russia\u2019s true extraction costs are hard to estimate. The cap is expected to be formally announced on Sunday, and oil embargoes in the EU and G7 will begin next week.

The report stated:  Culture is not collateral damage in the war against Ukraine; it\u2019s a target, a central pillar of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s justification for the war. Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukrainian culture and language simply don\u2019t exist. By targeting art museums, music halls, libraries, theaters and historical sites, he attempts to make it so.\u201d  PEN cited Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Culture as saying that 529 \u201ccultural heritage and cultural institutions\u201d have been destroyed or damaged since the war started. The figure includes both sites of national importance and cultural venues in towns and villages, the report said. The list includes the bombing in March of a theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds of people were sheltering. Around 600 people died in the attack, according to an Associated Press investigation. The PEN report said Russian soldiers have also seized and destroyed Ukrainian literature and Ukrainian-language books from public libraries in occupied regions. However, it acknowledged \u201cit is not always possible to determine if the bombings of cultural sites are deliberate or the result of Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas.\u201d PEN Ukraine said it has documented 31 civilian writers, artists and other cultural workers killed in Russian attacks this year, and that some other cultural figures have died while fighting with Ukrainian forces. American author and publisher Dave Eggers, part of the PEN delegation that presented the report, said:   The irony of Putin\u2019s attempts to erase the culture and heritage of Ukraine [is it] has only enriched their culture and made the world pay attention and be far more interested in Ukrainian writers and traditions.\u201d       5.29pm     The Kremlin thought it would sweep across Ukraine and take Kyiv in a matter of days. Now, more than nine months into its disastrous war with Ukraine, the new Russian strategy of targeting the infrastructure that brings light, heat and water into millions of Ukrainian homes has revealed Russia\u2019s own weakness and its desperation in the face of a defiant Ukrainian resistance. Russia\u2019s impotence \u2013 and the scale of the destruction wrought by Moscow against territory it considers its own \u2013 has leaked back into official statements, even as the Kremlin seeks to leave Ukraine in a dire state on the cusp of a bitter winter. At moments, Russian officials have compared the destruction in Ukrainian cities and its strategy to that of the second world war, nearly portraying the strategy as one of scorched earth. At a press conference on Thursday, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was given a tough question about Russia\u2019s shelling of Kherson, a city it claimed to annex in September and then fled from in November, and now regularly shells from across the banks of the Dnipro River. \u201cHow can you justify missile attacks on the civilian population, infrastructure, depriving people of access to water and electricity, including in the area of Kherson, which Russia considers its territory?\u201d he was asked. \u201cThe city of Stalingrad was our territory,\u201d replied Lavrov, referring to the modern city of Volgograd that was stage to the deadliest battle of the second world war. \u201cWe hit the Germans such that they ran away from there.\u201d Moscow\u2019s current strategy stands in stark contrast to Russia\u2019s initial plan: a shock-and-awe strike on Kyiv and other cities that would let them take over the country and its key infrastructure within weeks. Read the full analysis here.      4.42pm    Russian oil output could fall by 500,000 to 1m barrels per day early in 2023 after the European Union imposes a ban on seaborne imports from Monday, two sources at major Russian producers have told the Reuters news agency. The estimate is at the lower end of market analysts\u2019 forecasts of the combined impact of the ban and a proposed price cap on Russian oil, although the sources said the true level would depend on several factors yet to be settled. They requested anonymity to discuss sensitive market dynamics connected with the conflict in Ukraine that Russia calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, Reuters said. Alexei Kokin of Otkritie brokerage broadly agreed with their assessment of the likely impact of Western measures on Russian output.  It\u2019s roughly the same as the volume of seaborne supplies to the EU in recent weeks. I don\u2019t think they (Russian producers) will be able to divert that elsewhere.  The west wants to squeeze Russia\u2019s finances to reduce its ability to fund the conflict. Exports of crude, gas and oil products account for the majority of Russia\u2019s revenues, which have stayed high as disruption to production and sales following western sanctions has been more than offset by high prices on international markets. Russia\u2019s budget revenues from oil and gas jumped by over a third in the first 10 months of the year. Before the Ukraine conflict began on 24 February, Russia exported around 8m bpd of oil and oil products.     3.58pm    Turkey expects a \u201cclear picture\u201d on the war by next spring, its foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said, as fighting continued and Putin indicated he was open to negotiations. According to Reuters, he said:  Now Ukraine is advancing on the ground, retaking some of their occupied territories. But Russia in return is deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure. So life is getting difficult for Ukrainians particularly, and for all of us. I think before the spring time we will have clear picture about ceasefire or truce or negotiation table. But we will not give up. As Turkey we will continue our efforts.  Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine became more complicated with the fighting on the ground getting heavier, Cavusoglu said, adding that some Western countries should do more to get two sides to the negotiation table.     3.41pm    Olena Zelenska, the wife of the Ukrainian president, has urged the UK and other western nations not to allow themselves to become accustomed to her country\u2019s plight. Speaking to the Times, she has said:  It is quite understandable that the west is tired. However, this phrase, I hear it quite a lot \u2014 war fatigue \u2014 is quite a dangerous phrase for us because that is exactly what our adversary wants. They expect people to forget and the world to get tired of the sad news and for Ukraine to disappear from the front pages. They would then feel they had the permission to do what they want.  As winter draws in, she accused the Russians of trying to terrorise Ukrainians into believing they will not be able to survive.  It would be wrong to say these things don\u2019t scare us, they do, but we know we must endure this. The winter is treacherous and that is what they are counting on, it\u2019s not the first time they are using the force of nature against the civilian population.  She also detailed how she has cut off all contact with any Russian relative or acquaintance, telling the paper:  Of course, Putin is to blame but without the support of the Russian people he couldn\u2019t have done it on such a scale \u2026 I have relatives [in Russia], but we don\u2019t communicate. Those relationships have ended completely \u2026 There will be no point in returning to those dialogues, when your own life and children\u2019s and your family\u2019s is in great danger and people don\u2019t even ask if you are still alive, I think such relationships are over.      2.40pm    UN-appointed investigators are looking into whether Russia\u2019s attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine amount to war crimes, one of the inspection team said on Friday. Russia has been pounding Ukraine\u2019s electricity infrastructure since early October, causing blackouts and leaving millions without heating as temperatures plummet, Reuters reported. Russia says the assaults do not target civilians and are meant to reduce Ukraine\u2019s ability to fight and push it to negotiate \u2013 though Kyiv says such attacks are a war crime. \u201cPart of the analysis that we are engaged in at present \u2026 is whether the attacks constitute war crimes,\u201d Pablo de Greiff told a news conference, speaking from Kyiv. If they do, the team would work out what it \u201ccan do in order to make a contribution to the accountability for such crimes,\u201d he added. The three-member commission of inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council in March has already concluded that Russia committed war crimes in areas it occupied in Ukraine. Moscow regularly dismisses such accusations as a smear campaign.     2.27pm    When Alina Trebushnikova woke up on Thursday morning, the light was on and she knew the day had already got off to a bad start. The electricity in her neighbourhood of Novomoskovsk had returned in the middle of the night and that meant it would not be on for much longer. As a result, the little house would be colder and darker for much of the day. It gets dark by 4pm in Ukraine now and temperatures hover just below zero after nightfall. Next week a deep frost is expected and the days will grow even shorter, as Ukrainians approach their hardest winter since the second world war. Alina\u2019s husband, Oleksii, was away at his construction job and would only return long after dark. Their two boys, nine-year-old Ilia and Yakov, three years younger, were at the home of Alina\u2019s parents, who have a wood stove, independent of the vagaries of the grid. Alina is 31 and has lived in Novomoskovsk since she was seven, when her parents moved out of a block of flats in nearby Dnipro to live closer to the earth, as they put it. She now spends most of her days alone with Polina, born three months ago, while making food for the family, juggling with limited light, heat and ingredients.      2.20pm   Ukrainian embassy in Madrid receives 'bloody package'  Spanish police have cordoned off the area surrounding the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid after it received a \u201cbloody package\u201d similar to the ones sent to other embassies abroad, Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry said. This comes after a spate of six letter bombs targeted high-profile targets in Spain related to the war in Ukraine, including the United States\u2019 embassy, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the defence minister, an arms manufacturer, an airbase and a European satellite centre. On Friday, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said several of the country\u2019s embassies abroad have received \u201cbloody packages\u201d containing animal eyes.     1.15pm   EU proposes fines and jail terms for breaking Russia sanctions  Companies who break EU sanctions against Russia face fines of at least 5% of their worldwide turnover, under proposals put forward by the European commission. The plan, which needs approval from the European parliament and the EU\u2019s 27 member states before it can take effect, also said individuals breaking EU sanctions would face potential jail terms of at least five years, Reuters reports. Breaking sanctions on Russia is already a criminal offence in some EU countries, but in others it is treated as an administrative offence and penalties vary across the bloc. The Justice commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed rules would bring clarity, adding:  Too many gaps still remain between member states when it comes to the punishment of violation of EU sanctions.      12.48pm    Several Ukrainian embassies abroad have received \u201cbloody packages\u201d containing animal eyes, Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry has said, after a series of letter bombs were sent to sites in Spain including Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Madrid. The packages, soaked in a liquid with a distinctive colour and smell, were sent to Kyiv\u2019s embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Krakow, and the consulate in Brno, spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook.     12.20pm    The Ukrainian government will draw up a law banning churches affiliated with Russia, under moves described by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as necessary to prevent Moscow being able to \u201cweaken Ukraine from within\u201d, Reuters reports. The National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, which groups top security, military and political figures, told the government to draft the law following a series of raids on parishes that Kyiv says could be taking orders from Moscow. The security council also ordered investigations into suspected \u201csubversive activities of Russian special services in the religious environment of Ukraine\u201d and called for sanctions against unspecified individuals. Further searches of church premises were taking place on Friday. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) it said was searching at least five parishes belonging to a branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church which until May was subordinated to the Russian Orthodox Church. The agency also announced on Friday that it had served a notice of suspicion to a former diocese head in central Ukraine for allegedly coordinating a pro-Moscow information campaign with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. The branch has condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine but many Ukrainians fear it could be a source of Russian influence in the country. We have to create conditions where no actors dependent on the aggressor state (Russia) will have an opportunity to manipulate Ukrainians and weaken Ukraine from within. We will never allow anyone to build an empire inside the Ukrainian soul,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly address to the nation on Thursday. A spokesman for the church, Metropolitan Kliment, told Reuters his organisation \u201chas always acted within the framework of Ukrainian law\u201d.  Therefore, the state of Ukraine does not have any legal grounds to put pressure on or repress our believers.      12.07pm   Germany calls for peace talks - but Moscow says west must accept annexations  The German chancellor Olaf Scholz has urged the Russian president Vladimir Putin to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict as soon as possible, \u201cincluding a withdrawal of Russian troops\u201d, when the two leaders spoke recently. According to the Reuters news agency, Scholz\u2019s spokesperson said:  The chancellor condemned in particular the Russian airstrikes against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and stressed Germany\u2019s determination to support Ukraine in ensuring its defence capability against Russian aggression.  The Kremlin said Putin told Scholz the German and western line on Ukraine was \u201cdestructive\u201d and urged Berlin to rethink its approach. Its readout of the call served to highlight the gulf between Russia and western governments over Ukraine, even though Moscow and Washington have both said in the past 24 hours they are open in principle to talks, Reuters reports. The Kremlin said:  Attention was drawn to the destructive line of Western states, including Germany, which are pumping the Kyiv regime with weapons and training the Ukrainian military. All this, as well as comprehensive political and financial support for Ukraine, leads to the fact that Kyiv completely rejects the idea of any negotiations.  Kyiv has said peace talks are possible only if Russia stops attacking Ukrainian territory and withdraws its troops from Ukrainian soil. The Kremlin has indicated it wants a diplomatic solution and claimed Putin had always been open to talks, but said this was complicated by Washington\u2019s refusal to recognise \u201cthe new territories\u201d as Russian was hindering a search for any potential compromise. Separately, a German government spokesperson confirmed Berlin is not in talks with Ukraine about the transfer or deployment of Patriot air defence systems there. Reuters reports that Germany offered Poland the Patriot system last month to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people. The Polish defence minister Mariusz B\u0142aszczak later asked Germany to send the fire units to Ukraine instead.  Updated at 4.47pm GMT    11.32am    The Serbian president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 has said he will not allow his country to become a tool for those who want to circumvent EU sanctions on Russia. After meeting the EU enlargement commissioner Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, he said:  We have reacted in cases of re-export of certain goods and our state bodies have detained people from companies that were involved in bypassing sanctions against the Russian Federation.  Serbia, which aims to join the EU, has been criticised by foreign diplomats for not formally introducing sanctions against Russia, with which it has strong historical ties.  Updated at 12.08pm GMT    11.00am   Summary  The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day\u2019s stories so far:  Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv\u2019s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak\u2019s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine\u2019s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine\u2019s general staff. He said Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, would make the total public \u201cwhen the right moment comes\u201d. Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Russian troops had bombarded the city of Kherson and other parts of the region 42 times in the same period. Vladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. The seven tanks, which are now being repaired by Munich-based arms manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), are meant to help Ukraine in protecting its cities and infrastructure against Russian shelling, reported Der Spiegel. The Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough. \u201cWe should make sure that we are stronger,\u201d Marin said in Sydney on Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be brutally honest with you, Europe isn\u2019t strong enough. We would be in trouble without the United States.\u201d The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe\u2019s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s electricity before Russia\u2019s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported. The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has suggested. This threat has highly likely prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report reads. Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details. The chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a \u00a3580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP\u2019s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country. The archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be \u201cno way we force peace\u201d in Ukraine. Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be \u201cvery long term\u201d, the Press Association reported. US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he\u2019s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn\u2019t done that yet,\u201d Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday. Biden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for \u201cwidely documented atrocities and war crimes\u201d in Ukraine. Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression, which he added has been \u201cincredibly brutal\u201d. In a joint statement with Macron, the leaders said: \u201cIntentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d  That\u2019s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest news from Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.  Updated at 11.10am GMT    10.36am   Russia says west's refusal to recognise annexations a barrier to peace talks  Vladimir Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to Putin if the Kremlin chief was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. \u201cThe president of the Russian Federation has always been, is and remains open to negotiations in order to ensure our interests,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about Biden\u2019s remarks. \u201cThe most preferable way to achieve our interests is through peaceful, diplomatic means,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cPutin was, is and remains open to contacts and negotiations.\u201d  Updated at 1.22pm GMT    10.02am   Three killed in Russian attacks on Kherson region  Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on Telegram that Russian troops had bombarded the city of Kherson and other parts of the region 42 times in the same period. The city of Kherson was liberated by Ukrainian forces in mid-November after months of Russian occupation, but has been under fire since then from Russian troops who retreated to the opposite side of the River Dnipro. The city has also suffered problems with its power supply, Reuters reported. Yanushevych said yesterday that power had been lost again after recently being restored.  Updated at 11.34am GMT    9.51am    Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River.

The nuclear plant, Europe\u2019s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s electricity before Russia\u2019s invasion, and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Repeated shelling around the Russian-held plant has raised concern about the potential for a grave accident just 300 miles from the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl disaster. \u201cMy commitment is to reach a solution as soon as possible. I hope by the end of the year,\u201d Rafael Grossi told Italian newspaper la Repubblica in an interview published on Friday. Grossi did not rule out meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin, as well as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cOur goal is to avoid a nuclear accident, not to create a military situation that would favour either one party or the other\u201d, Grossi said.  Updated at 11.01am GMT    8.26am    Germany is aiming to deliver seven Gepard tanks that had been destined for the scrap pile to Ukraine this spring, adding to 30 of the air-defence tanks that are already being used to fight against the Russian army, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. The seven tanks, which are now being repaired by Munich-based arms manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), are meant to help Ukraine in protecting its cities and infrastructure against Russian shelling, reported Der Spiegel. The German government also aims to send more ammunition for the Gepards along with the additional tanks, it reported. Supply of ammunition for the Gepard has proven problematic as Switzerland, which has stocks of ammunition, refuses to supply it, citing its neutral status, Reuters reported.  Updated at 10.05am GMT    7.47am    The archbishop of Canterbury has said there must be \u201cno way we force peace\u201d in Ukraine. Justin Welby added that the need for support is going to be \u201cvery long term\u201d, the Press Association reported. Asked what he learned from his visit to the war-torn country, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme:  First of all, the need for solidarity and support for Ukraine. And secondly, that there must be no way in which we force peace on Ukraine or they\u2019re put under pressure. Third, that the need for support is going to be very long term.  Pressed on whether he meant, in some cases, war is the right course, he said:  Peace is always better than war. But there are times when justice demands that there is the defeat of what we call, the archbishop of York and I called when it started, an evil invasion. And I don\u2019t regret saying that. Ukraine is the victim here, we can\u2019t slip back to a 1938 Czechoslovakia, sort of people far away of whom we know little situation. There has to be real resilience.   Updated at 7.54am GMT    7.22am    Russia tested a new missile defence system rocket, its defence ministry said today. The missile was launched from the Sary Shagan testing range in Kazakhstan. Other than saying the test was successful, the ministry gave few other details.  Updated at 7.42am GMT    7.01am    The Belarusian media outlet Nexta has published a series of images purportedly showing the aftermath of Russian strikes on the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia early this morning. The city\u2019s mayor, Anatoly Kurtev, earlier announced the attack on Telegram, saying Russia intended to destroy the industrial and energy infrastructure of the city.   Updated at 8.22am GMT    6.58am   Russia\u2019s withdrawal from west bank of Dnipro allows Ukraine to strike at logistics: UK MoD  Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River last month has provided the Ukrainian armed forces with opportunities to strike additional Russian logistics nodes and lines of communication, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has suggested.  This threat has highly likely prompted Russian logisticians to relocate supply nodes, including rail transfer points, further south and east, the latest British intelligence report reads. \u201cRussian logistics units will need to conduct extra labour-intensive loading and unloading from rail to road transport. Road moves will subsequently still be vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery as they move on to supply Russian forward defensive positions,\u201d the report adds. \u201cRussia\u2019s shortage of munitions (exacerbated by these logistics challenges) is likely one of the main factors currently limiting Russia\u2019s potential to restart effective, large scale offensive ground operations.\u201d      6.50am    The chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on BP to exit Russia entirely after the fossil fuel firm was offered a \u00a3580m dividend by the oil giant Rosneft. Oleg Ustenko has written to BP\u2019s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand the British company cuts ties with the state-controlled Russian firm nine months after announcing its intention to leave the country. BP has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin\u2019s most important oil assets. The FTSE 100 company vowed to end its shareholding in late February after Russia invaded Ukraine. BP took a \u00a318.7bn hit by writing off the shareholding from its books, but still owns the stock. Last month Rosneft\u2019s boss, Igor Sechin, said the British company should reconsider that position and that it had put aside a dividend, in a Russian account, for BP. In a letter to Looney, seen by the Guardian, Ustenko wrote: \u201cBP was among the first of the oil majors to announce its intention to exit Russia by selling its stake in Rosneft, the Kremlin\u2019s oil company. \u201cYet after nine months of Russian aggression, war crimes and the bombardment of civilian infrastructure, all funded and fuelled by Russian oil, gas and coal, BP remains a shareholder in Rosneft.\u201d Ustenko cited Global Witness analysis that showed the dividend for the first nine months of 2022 was worth an estimated \u00a3580m, or the equivalent of a third of the UK\u2019s direct aid to Ukraine this year. \u201cNo accounting mechanisms or statements from BP will change this fact. This is blood money, pure and simple,\u201d he said.      6.31am   Finland PM Sanna Marin says Europe is \u2018not strong enough\u2019 without the US   The Finish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help it is not resilient enough. \u201cWe should make sure that we are stronger,\u201d Marin said in Sydney on Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be brutally honest with you, Europe isn\u2019t strong enough. We would be in trouble without the United States.\u201d Marin insisted Ukraine must be given \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to win the war, adding that the United States had been pivotal in supplying Kyiv with the weapons, finance and humanitarian aid necessary to blunt Russia\u2019s advance. \u201cWe have to make sure that we are also building those capabilities when it comes to European defence, the European defence industry, and making sure that we could cope in different kinds of situations,\u201d she said. Marin said when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the priority of most Finns changed \u201covernight\u201d to security. Until Russia invaded Ukraine, Finland\u2019s priorities were to have working bilateral relations with Russia and be close partners with members Nato, but not be a member, she said. \u201cThat was the best way to secure our nation.\u201d   Updated at 7.47am GMT    6.25am    The United States is reportedly working with two Middle Eastern countries to shift advanced Nasams air defence systems to Ukraine in the next three to six months. Weapons manufacturer Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told Politico late Thursday:  There are Nasams deployed across the Middle East, and some of our Nato allies and we [the US] are actually working with a couple of Middle Eastern countries that currently employ Nasams and trying to direct those back up to Ukraine.\u201d  He spoke a day after the Pentagon awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon for six Nasams expected to be built in late 2025.  \u201cJust because it takes 24 months to build, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to take 24 months to get in country,\u201d Hayes said. He declined to name the Middle Eastern countries that would send the systems to Ukraine, but Defence Security Cooperation Agency records cited by Politico list Oman and Qatar as its purchasers. Kyiv received two of the eight approved deliveries of Nasams in early November. Nasams, or national advanced surface-to-air missile systems, have a longer range than other western-supplied air defence systems in Ukraine.     6.16am   Biden prepared to speak to Putin if he is willing to end the war  US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies.   I\u2019m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he\u2019s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn\u2019t done that yet,\u201d Biden told a news conference at the White House with Macron on Thursday.   Macron said he would continue to talk to Putin to \u201ctry to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results\u201d such as the safety of nuclear plants. Biden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for \u201cwidely documented atrocities and war crimes\u201d in Ukraine. At the East Room press conference, Biden said he had been shocked by Russia\u2019s brutality in Ukraine but insisted that Vladimir Putin was \u201cnot going to succeed\u201d, adding: \u201cPresident Macron and I have resolved that we\u2019re going to continue working together to hold Russia accountable for their actions and to mitigate the global impacts of Putin\u2019s war on the rest of the world.\u201d \u201cIntentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d Taking questions from reporters, Biden added:   There\u2019s one way for this war to end \u2013 the rational way. Putin to pull out of Ukraine \u2026 it\u2019s sick, what he\u2019s doing \u2026 I\u2019m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he\u2019s looking for a way to end the war.\u201d  Macron said they discussed initiatives \u201cto keep supporting and strengthen our support to the Ukrainian troops and enable them to resist\u201d.      6.07am   Russian missiles hit Zaporizhzhia, mayor says  Russian forces reportedly struck the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight. Zaporizhzhia mayor Anatoly Kurtev announced the attack on Telegram early this morning.  As a result of the enemy attack, the building of the infrastructure object is on fire. The blast wave blew out windows in nearby houses.\u201d   Kurtev said emergency services are on the scene and casualties are not yet known. Zaporizhzhia administrative head Oleksandr Starukh posted an update to Telegram this morning, writing:  Tonight, the enemy once again launched a rocket attack on Zaporizhzhia. Its goal was the destruction of the industrial and energy infrastructure of the regional centre. As a result, a fire broke out. According to available data, there are no victims.\u201d      5.58am   Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed, Zelenskiy aide reveals  Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have lost somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers so far in the war against Russia, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told a Ukrainian television network on Thursday.  We have official figures from the general staff, we have official figures from the top command, and they amount to [between] 10,000 and 12,500 to 13,000 killed,\u201d Podolyak told the Kanal 24 channel.  Zelenskiy would make the official data public \u201cwhen the right moment comes\u201d, he added. Top US general Mark Milley last month said more than 100,000 Russian military personnel have been killed or wounded in Ukraine, with Kyiv\u2019s forces likely suffering similar casualties. Those figures - which could not be independently confirmed - are the most precise to date from the US government.  Updated at 6.16am GMT    5.50am   Summary and welcome  Hello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Samantha Lock and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have lost somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers so far in the war against Russia, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told a local television network on Thursday. Meanwhile Russian forces reportedly struck the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight. City mayor Anatoly Kurtev announced the attack on Telegram early this morning. \u201cAs a result of the enemy attack, the building of the infrastructure object is on fire. The blast wave blew out windows in nearby houses,\u201d he said. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments:  US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron presented a united front on Ukraine with Biden saying he would talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is willing to end the war and only in consultation with Nato allies. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to speak with Mr Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he\u2019s looking for a way to end the war.

Macron said he would continue to talk to Putin to \u201ctry to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results\u201d such as the safety of nuclear plants. Biden and Macron pledged to hold Russia accountable for \u201cwidely documented atrocities and war crimes\u201d in Ukraine. Biden said their support would continue in the face of Russian aggression, which he added has been \u201cincredibly brutal\u201d. In a joint statement with Macron, the leaders said: \u201cIntentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d   Russian rockets pounded neighbourhoods in Kherson knocking out power in the city where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops left. Local authorities said about two-thirds of Kherson had electricity as of Thursday night. Some residents congregated at the train station or at government-supported tents that provided heating, food, drinks and electricity to charge mobile phones.   Ukraine\u2019s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on what is now the main frontline in the south. The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro.   Kyiv\u2019s mayor Vitaliy Klitschko told residents to stock up on water, food and warm clothes in the event of a total blackout caused by Russian strikes. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency service said on Wednesday nine people had been killed in fires in the past 24 hours as people broke safety rules trying to heat their homes following Russian attacks on power facilities.   Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have lost somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers so far in the war against Russia, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told a Ukrainian television network on Thursday. \u201cWe have official figures from the general staff, we have official figures from the top command, and they amount to (between) 10,000 and 12,500 to 13,000 killed,\u201d Podolyak told the Kanal 24 channel.   More than 1,300 prisoners have been returned to Ukraine since Russian troops invaded, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. Zelenskiy was speaking after a new exchange of 50 prisoners with Russian and pro-Russian forces. \u201cAfter today\u2019s exchange, there are already 1,319 heroes who returned home,\u201d Zelenskiy said on Instagram, posting a photo showing a few dozen men holding Ukrainian flags.   EU members have tentatively agreed to a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil, diplomats said on Thursday. Europe will begin enforcing an embargo on Russian crude shipments from Monday, so the price cap will apply to oil exported by sea by Moscow to ports around the world. Poland is left to give the final nod and Estonia is under pressure to abandon its threat to veto the cap that it believes is set too high to have an impact on the Russian war machine.   The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was too early reach a verdict on talks between Poland and Germany about sending the Patriot air-defence systems from Germany to Ukraine. \u201cWe all agree on the urgent need to help Ukraine, including with air defence systems,\u201d Stoltenberg said at a joint news conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz.   European Council President Charles Michel urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to use the country\u2019s \u201cinfluence\u201d on Russia over its war in Ukraine during a visit to Beijing on Thursday. \u201cI urged President Xi, as we did at our EU-China summit in April, to use his influence on Russia to respect the UN charter,\u201d Michel said. President Xi made it clear that China is not providing weapons to Russia and that nuclear threats are not acceptable, the European Council president added   Spain has ordered increased security at government buildings and embassies after the discovery of letter bombs and incendiary devices, including one that exploded at Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Madrid on Wednesday and another that was detected at the US embassy on Thursday. Devices have also been sent to the prime minister, the defence ministry, an arms company that makes rocket launchers donated to Kyiv, and a military airbase near the Spanish capital.   Ukraine will move to impose limitations on religious organisations in the country which have links to Russia. \u201cThe National Security and Defence Council has instructed the government to propose to [parliament] a bill on proscribing activities in Ukraine by religious organisations affiliated with centres of influence in Russia,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his latest national address on Thursday. \u201cNational security officials should intensify measures to identify and counteract the subversive activities of the Russian special services in the religious space in Ukraine.\u201d    "

The identity of the individual is not yet known, but their family has been informed. They are believed to be the eighth British national to have died in Ukraine since the war began last February.\nUkrainian forces have reportedly blown up a bridge near the eastern city of Bakhmut, in a sign they may be planning to retreat from the area. Ukraine denies it intends to leave Bakhmut, despite six months of heavy fighting and reportedly dwindling stockpiles. The capture of Bakhmut would give Russia a significant symbolic boost ahead of the first anniversary of the war.\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group whose mercenaries have been fighting for months to take the eastern city of Bakhmut, has said the battle is far from over. In a Telegram post, Prigozhin said Ukraine was reinforcing with up to 500 new fighters a day. \u201cBakhmut will not be taken tomorrow, because there is heavy resistance and grinding, the meat grinder is working,\u201d he said, adding \u201cWe will not be celebrating in the near future.\u201d\nRussian forces have made incremental progress in the last day or two in their assault on the Ukrainian city of Bahkmut but it is unclear if it will fall, the White House has said. John Kirby, the US national security council spokesperson, added that if Bakhmut were to fall to the Russians \u201cit would not have a strategic impact on the overall war\u201d.\nWagner Group forces have almost certainly made further small gains over the last three days around the northern outskirts of Bakhmut, including into the village of Krasna Hora, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. However, organised Ukrainian defence continues in the area and the tactical Russian advance to the south of the town has likely made little progress, the latest British intelligence report adds.\nOne Ukrainian worker was killed and many have been hurt in recent days trying to repair the power network following Russian airstrikes, according to energy minister German Galushchenko. Russian unleashed a wave of airstrikes on Friday, targeting Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure and causing emergency power outages for millions of people. In a statement, Galushchenko and Ukraine\u2019s grid operator Ukrenergy said the country was producing enough energy to meet consumers\u2019 needs.\nUkraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has taken part in the Nato ministerial talks in Brussels. Reznikov said his goals included protecting Ukraine\u2019s skies, \u201cstrengthening the tank coalition\u201d, securing sufficient ammunition, ensuring more training for the Ukrainian army and stable logistics, maintenance and repair of weapons. A meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group, a US-initiative that convenes more than 50 countries supporting Kyiv in its defence against Russian aggression, met in Brussels ahead of Nato ministerial talks.\nThe US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, has said he expects Ukraine to conduct an offensive against Russia in spring. Speaking at a news conference following a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group, Austin said Russia is introducing a number of new troops to the battlefield but that many are ill-trained and ill-equipped. Russia has \u201cinflicted a year of tragedy and terror\u201d on its neighbour Ukraine, he said.\nRussia has lost \u201cstrategically, operationally and tactically\u201d, Gen Mark Milley, chairman of America\u2019s joint chiefs of staff, has said. Speaking at a joint news conference with Lloyd Austin, Milley said Russians were \u201cpaying an enormous price on the battlefield\u201d in Ukraine.\nThe Nato secretary general has urged members of the transatlantic military alliance to ramp up ammunition production for Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg warned Vladimir Putin was preparing for new offensives and attacks, and that the question of supplying fighter jets to Ukraine was on the agenda but \u201cnot the most urgent issue now\u201d.\nNorway has announced it will send eight German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks and other equipment to Ukraine. In a statement, Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said it was \u201cmore crucial than ever to support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom\u201d. The announcement comes a day after St\u00f8re spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a phone call, where the pair discussed Norway\u2019s five-year pledge for Ukraine.\nGermany has signed contracts with Rheinmetall to restart the production of ammunition for the Gepard anti-aircraft guns it has delivered to Kyiv, the German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, has said. \u201cWe will quickly start our own production of Gepard ammunition at Rheinmetall. I am very happy we have been able to guarantee the delivery of this important part of air defence,\u201d Pistorius said before a meeting with Nato ministers in Brussels.\nThe US has told Ukraine it will not send long-range missiles because it has too few to spare, according to a report. US officials have said transferring Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to the battlefield in Ukraine would risk a shortage of its own stockpiles and damage its own readiness for any fight in the future, sources have told Politico.\nA South Korean court has granted two Russians who fled their country to avoid being drafted to fight in Ukraine the right to apply for refugee status. The two men, who have been stranded at Incheon International Airport, near Seoul, since last October, will be able to leave the terminal building and enter the country, the court said. The court denied a similar request from a third Russian citizen, without detailing the reasons for the decision.\nTwo Dutch F-35 fighters were scrambled to intercept three Russian military aircraft near Poland, according to the Netherlands\u2019 defence ministry. Poland\u2019s defence ministry confirmed that Dutch F-35 fighter jets were scrambled on Monday to intercept three Russian aircraft. The F-35 fighters were operating over international waters and Polish airspace was not violated, it said.\nThe UK says it will mark the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with a national moment of silence. Prime minister Rishi Sunak will lead a one-minute silence at 1100 GMT on 24 February, in an expression of solidarity with Ukraine.\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group, has admitted that he founded and financed a company the US has described as a \u201cRussian troll farm\u201d which meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin\u2019s statement outlined his specific links to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a St Petersburg-based company that US intelligence officials say was central to Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n 6.27pm  \n\nUkraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has appointed three new deputies after a corruption scandal which forced out one of his deputies and put his own position in doubt.\nReznikov, one of Ukraine\u2019s better-known figures internationally, had pledged to tackle graft after it emerged the defence ministry paid twice or three times the supermarket price of food to supply troops on the frontline.\nOne of his deputies resigned following the allegation, which the ministry has denied. Two others were dismissed on Tuesday.\nThe Ukrainian government said it had confirmed Lieutenant-General Oleksandr Pavliuk, who briefly served as Kyiv region governor during the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion, as the most senior of his deputies.\nAndriy Shevchenko, a former ambassador to Canada, and Vitaliy Deyneha, an IT professional who co-founded an NGO that raises funds for the military, were nominated as junior deputies.\n\n\n\n 6.17pm  \nAt least 6,000 Ukrainian children held in Russia for \u2018re-education\u2019 - report\n\nRussia has held at least 6,000 Ukrainian children, likely many more, in sites whose primary purpose appears to be political re-education, a US-backed report has said.\nResearchers from Yale University identified at least 43 camps and other facilities in Russian-held Crimea and Russia, where Ukrainian children have been held as part of a \u201clarge-scale systematic network\u201d operated by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine last year, the report said.\nThe children held in these sites included those with parents or clear familial guardians, those Russia deemed orphans, and other children who were in the care of Ukrainian state institutions before the invasion, it said.\nSome of the children were moved through the system and adopted by Russian families, or moved into foster care in Russia, the report said.\nThe youngest child identified was just four months old, and some camps were giving military training to children as young as 14, it said.\nNathaniel Raymond, one of the researchers, said in a briefing:\n\nWhat is documented in this report is a clear violation of the 4th Geneva Convention.\n\nHe said it could also be evidence that Russia has committed genocide during its war in Ukraine, since the transfer of children for purposes of changing, altering or eliminating national identity can constitute a component act of the crime of genocide.\n\n\n\n 5.55pm  \n\nRussian forces have made incremental progress in the last day or two in their assault on the Ukrainian city of Bahkmut but it is unclear if it will fall, the White House has said.\nJohn Kirby, the US national security council spokesperson, added that if Bakhmut were to fall to the Russians \u201cit would not have a strategic impact on the overall war\u201d.\n\n\n\n 5.45pm  \nBritish national dies in Ukraine, says UK foreign office\n\nA British national has died in Ukraine, the UK government has said.\nA Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: \n\nWe are supporting the family of a British national who died in Ukraine, and are in contact with the local authorities.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.46pm GMT\n\n\n 5.30pm  \n\nHere are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.17pm  \n\nA South Korean court has granted two Russians who fled their country to avoid being drafted to fight in Ukraine the right to apply for refugee status.\nThe two men, who have been stranded at Incheon International Airport, near Seoul, since last October, will be able to leave the terminal building and enter the country, the court said.\nThe court denied a similar request from a third Russian citizen, without detailing the reasons for the decision.\nThe three Russian citizens, whose lawyer requested they not be named out of concern for the safety of their families in Russia, have been living inside the airport since October.\nThey landed in South Korea with hopes of being granted asylum, but the justice ministry rejected their applications, saying that avoiding military service did not qualify as a valid reason for receiving asylum in South Korea.\n\u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s decision on the two but it is regrettable that it rejected the other one\u2019s plea,\u201d said Lee Jong-chan, a lawyer representing the three. He added:\n\nThey came here trying to avoid killing innocent people and getting themselves killed in a war initiated by their home country. It took them four months just to win the right to apply for refugee status.\n\nThe two will now be allowed to end their airport stay and will be settled in South Korea while undergoing the asylum recognition process, which could take years.\nThe third Russian has the right to appeal his rejection, but he must remain living at the airport in the interim. Lee said returning to Russia was not a viable option for the third man. \n\n\n\n 5.08pm  \n\nRussian convicts have said they are being employed by the country\u2019s defence ministry to fight as \u201ccannon fodder\u201d in Ukraine, according to a report. \nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian Wagner mercenary group, said last week that the recruitment of prisoners by Wagner \u201chas completely stopped\u201d. \nInstead, CNN reports that Russia is pursuing a disturbing new strategy of directly employing convicts to fight in Ukraine. In an audio recording obtained by the news channel, a Russian convict who was sent from prison to fight tells his wife:\n\nI am being taken to be shot. I lost a lot of people there. Remember this: do not send more people here. It\u2019s enough, they want to kill us all.\n\nA Ukrainian intelligence official confirmed to the news channel that Russian prisoners recently captured by Ukrainian forces had said they were directly employed by the defence ministry.\nThe official said this new strategy had \u201cechoes of internal squabbling among the Russian military leadership\u201d including among the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and Valery Gerasimov, the overall commander for the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 4.47pm  \n\nThe EU will launch an ad hoc group to investigate how billions of dollars in frozen Russian funds, including central bank reserves, can be used for reconstruction work in Ukraine, according to the Swedish government.\nSpeaking at a news conference in Stockholm, prime minister Ulf Kristersson said:\n\nThe mandate is to contribute to mapping which funds have been frozen in the European Union ... and secondly how to legally proceed to access those funds.\n\nThere is no prior model for how to handle the Russian assets, and the EU must ensure that appropriate legal procedures are established, he said.\nHe added:\n\nIt\u2019s Russian tax payers, not all other tax payers, who must bear the cost of the necessary reconstruction work.\n\n\n\n\n 4.42pm  \nBakhmut will not be captured 'in the near future', says Wagner boss\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group whose mercenaries have been fighting for months to take the eastern city of Bakhmut, has said the battle is far from over. \nIn a Telegram post, Prigozhin said Ukraine was reinforcing with up to 500 new fighters a day.\nAccording to his press service, Prigozhin said:\n\nBakhmut will not be taken tomorrow, because there is heavy resistance and grinding, the meat grinder is working. \n\n\u201cWe will not be celebrating in the near future,\u201d he added.\nHis comments came as Ukrainian forces have reportedly blown up a bridge near Bakhmut, in a sign they may be planning to retreat from the area.\nTroops blew up the bridge on Monday, according to a local Donetsk region news site. Ukraine denies it intends to leave Bakhmut, despite six months of heavy fighting and reportedly dwindling stockpiles.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.43pm GMT\n\n\n 4.22pm  \n\nIran is emerging as a global leader in the production of cheap and lethal drones, according to US officials who say Tehran is using the war in Ukraine as a shop window for its technologies.\nAnalysts at the Defense Intelligence Agency outlined how Iran had turned from being a regional drone player in the Middle East to becoming Moscow\u2019s most significant military backer in the war.\nCountering denials by Iran\u2019s foreign ministry that its drones had been used in deadly attacks in Ukraine, including against civilian energy infrastructure, the officials shared declassified intelligence demonstrating that Iranian drones used in attacks in the Middle East \u2013 including one claimed by Iran \u2013 were identical in all significant features to drones being used in Ukraine.\nOne official described Tehran as having emerged as a global leader in the production of cheap and very effective drones.\nAlthough the supply of Iranian drones to Moscow for its war in Ukraine has long been treated as fact in much reporting, as well as in multiple US briefings that have sought to describe the increasingly close military cooperation between Iran and Russia, the officials stressed that the point of their briefing was to persuade sceptics in a global audience of the depth of the intelligence the US has amassed on Iran\u2019s drone shipments.\nIran has supplied three models of drone to Russia: Shahed 131 and 136 single-use kamikaze drones, used by Moscow as a cheaper alternative to cruise missiles, and the Mohajer-6 multi-role drone, which can be used for intelligence gathering and to carry a missile payload.\nUsing in-flight footage and debris of suicide and multi-role drones used in Ukraine, the officials said they sought to prove that Iranian denials that its drones had been used were untrue, as the US seeks wider support for sanctions against Iran over its drone supplies.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 4.14pm  \n\nNato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has been addressing a Nato summit at the military alliance\u2019s headquarters in Brussels.\nStoltenberg begins by welcoming Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, to the meeting, and says it has been almost a year since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion of Ukraine.\nHe describes Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine as having brought \u201cuntold suffering to the people of Ukraine, shattered peace in Europe and affected people around the world to the food and energy crisis\u201d.\nVladimir Putin has made \u201ctwo big strategic mistakes\u201d, Stoltenberg says, by underestimating the \u201cstrength and bravery\u201d of Ukraine as well as the \u201cunity and soul\u201d of Nato and partners.\n\n\n\n 4.00pm  \nSummary of the day so far\n\nIt\u2019s 6pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:\n\nUkrainian forces have reportedly blown up a bridge near the eastern city of Bakhmut, in a sign they may be planning to retreat from the area. Ukraine denies it intends to leave Bakhmut, despite six months of heavy fighting and reportedly dwindling stockpiles. The capture of Bakhmut would give Russia a significant symbolic boost ahead of the first anniversary of the war.\nWagner Group forces have almost certainly made further small gains over the last three days around the northern outskirts of Bakhmut, including into the village of Krasna Hora, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. However, organised Ukrainian defence continues in the area and the tactical Russian advance to the south of the town has likely made little progress, the latest British intelligence report adds.\nOne Ukrainian worker was killed and many have been hurt in recent days trying to repair the power network following Russian airstrikes, according to energy minister German Galushchenko. Russian unleashed a wave of airstrikes on Friday, targeting Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure and causing emergency power outages for millions of people. In a statement, Galushchenko and Ukraine\u2019s grid operator Ukrenergy said the country was producing enough energy to meet consumers\u2019 needs.\nThe Nato secretary general has urged members of the transatlantic military alliance to ramp up ammunition production for Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg warned Vladimir Putin was preparing for new offensives and attacks, and that the question of supplying fighter jets to Ukraine was on the agenda but \u201cnot the most urgent issue now\u201d.\nUkraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, is taking part in the Nato ministerial talks that begin later on Tuesday. Reznikov said his goals included protecting Ukraine\u2019s skies, \u201cstrengthening the tank coalition\u201d, securing sufficient ammunition, ensuring more training for the Ukrainian army and stable logistics, maintenance and repair of weapons.\nA meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group, a US-initiative that convenes more than 50 countries supporting Kyiv in its defence against Russian aggression, has met in Brussels ahead of Nato ministerial talks. \nThe US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, has said he expects Ukraine to conduct an offensive against Russia in spring. Speaking at a news conference following a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group, Austin said Russia is introducing a number of new troops to the battlefield but that many are ill-trained and ill-equipped. Russia has \u201cinflicted a year of tragedy and terror\u201d on its neighbour Ukraine, he said. \nRussia has lost \u201cstrategically, operationally and tactically\u201d, Gen Mark Milley, chairman of America\u2019s joint chiefs of staff, has said. Speaking at a joint news conference with Lloyd Austin, Milley said Russians were \u201cpaying an enormous price on the battlefield\u201d in Ukraine.\nNorway has announced it will send eight German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks and other equipment to Ukraine. In a statement, Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said it was \u201cmore crucial than ever to support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom\u201d. The announcement comes a day after St\u00f8re spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a phone call, where the pair discussed Norway\u2019s five-year pledge for Ukraine.\nGermany has signed contracts with Rheinmetall to restart the production of ammunition for the Gepard anti-aircraft guns it has delivered to Kyiv, the German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, has said. \u201cWe will quickly start our own production of Gepard ammunition at Rheinmetall. I am very happy we have been able to guarantee the delivery of this important part of air defence,\u201d Pistorius said before a meeting with Nato ministers in Brussels.\nThe US has told Ukraine it will not send long-range missiles because it has too few to spare, according to a report. US officials have said transferring Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to the battlefield in Ukraine would risk a shortage of its own stockpiles and damage its own readiness for any fight in the future, sources have told Politico.\nThe Kremlin has again criticised Nato over its stance towards the war in Ukraine, saying the military alliance was becoming more and more involved in the conflict in Ukraine. \u201cNato is an organisation which is hostile to us and which proves this hostility every day,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.\nTwo Dutch F-35 fighters were scrambled to intercept three Russian military aircraft near Poland, according to the Netherlands\u2019 defence ministry. Poland\u2019s defence ministry confirmed that Dutch F-35 fighter jets were scrambled on Monday to intercept three Russian aircraft. The F-35 fighters were operating over international waters and Polish airspace was not violated, it said. \nThe UK says it will mark the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with a national moment of silence. Prime minister Rishi Sunak will lead a one-minute silence at 1100 GMT on 24 February, in an expression of solidarity with Ukraine.\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group, has admitted that he founded and financed a company the US has described as a \u201cRussian troll farm\u201d which meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin\u2019s statement outlined his specific links to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a St Petersburg-based company that US intelligence officials say was central to Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.\n\nGood afternoon from London. I\u2019m L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong and I\u2019m here to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. \n\n\n\n 3.33pm  \nRussia has lost \u2018strategically, operationally and tactically\u2019, says US general\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chairman of America\u2019s joint chiefs of staff, has said Russia has lost \u201cstrategically, operationally and tactically\u201d and that they are \u201cpaying an enormous price on the battlefield\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nMilley, speaking at a joint news conference with US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, said President Vladimir Putin believed he could defeat Ukraine quickly when he ordered his troops to invade almost a year ago.\n\n[Putin] was wrong. Ukraine remains free. They remain independent. Nato and its coalition has never been stronger.\nNow, Russia is a global pariah and the world remains inspired by Ukrainian bravery and resilience. In short, Russia has lost \u2013 they\u2019ve lost strategically, operationally and tactically and they are paying an enormous price on the battlefield.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.36pm GMT\n\n\n 3.23pm  \nUS 'expects to see Ukraine conduct offensive in spring'\n\nThe US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, has been speaking at a news conference in Brussels, following a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group, a US-initiative that convenes more than 50 countries supporting Kyiv in its defence against Russian aggression.\nThe world will mark a \u201cgrim milestone\u201d next week during the anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, he says. Moscow has \u201cinflicted a year of tragedy and terror\u201d on its neighbour, he says.\nHe said he expected Ukraine to conduct an offensive against Russia in spring. He said:\n\n\u201cUkraine wants to create momentum ... We expect to see them conduct an offensive sometime in the spring.\n\n\nHe also said that Russia is introducing a number of new troops to the battlefield but that many are ill-trained and ill-equipped.\nHe added that the Ukraine defence contract group represents a rejection of Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cvision of the world \u2013 a world of chaos\u201d that will support Ukraine\u2019s self-defence for the long haul,.\nMembers of the group have given Kyiv more than eight combat brigades, which includes major contributions from the US of Bradleys and Abrams tanks, and a donation of Challenger 2 tanks from the UK, he says.\nAustin says it is a priority for him and his colleagues to ensure that western donations to Ukraine will be used \u201cas intended\u201d and that there is a \u201cproactive move to prevent arms proliferation\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 4.03pm GMT\n\n\n 2.40pm  \n\nTalks on supplying F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine will probably bear fruit, but pressure is necessary, the Polish defence minister said on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe are aware that our potential in this area is limited, because we have only 48 F-16 aircraft, but the allies have much more potential, so I think that this conversation will \u2026 end with positive decisions,\u201d Reuters reports Mariusz Blaszczak told the media in Brussels. \u201cYou just have to apply pressure.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.37pm  \n\nThe Russian foreign ministry\u2019s spokesperson Maria Zakharova has fiercely criticised claims that Russia has been attempting to destabilise Ukraine\u2019s neighbour Moldova. According to reports in Tass and also carried by media in Moldova, she said:\n\nThese accusations are completely unfounded. They start from the classic trick that the United States, other western countries and Ukraine often use: first they make accusations based on so-called secret information that cannot be verified, and then they use it to justify their own illegal actions.\n\nZakharova claimed that Kyiv was trying to \u201cdraw Chi\u0219in\u0103u into a tough confrontation with Russia.\u201d\nOn Monday Moldova\u2019s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow of plotting to destabilise the former Soviet republic, saying it was planning to use foreign saboteurs to bring down her country\u2019s leadership, stop it joining the EU and use it in the war against Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine had uncovered a Russian intelligence plan \u201cfor the destruction of Moldova\u201d.\nMoldova\u2019s breakaway region of Transnistria is controlled by Russian separatists and borders Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 2.19pm  \n\nRomania has reported that it deployed two MiG-21 Lancer planes to seek out what looked like a weather balloon on radar, but that they could not confirm the target, Reuters reports.\nEarlier neighbouring Moldova closed its airspace without specifying a reason.\nOn Friday there was an incident when Moldova summoned the Russian ambassador after a missile destined for a target in Ukraine overflew its airspace. Ukrainian sources initially claimed the missile had also entered Romanian airspace, which Romania denied.\n\n\n\n 1.51pm  \n\nThe US has told Ukraine it will not send long-range missiles because it has too few to spare, according to a report. \nUS officials have said transferring Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to the battlefield in Ukraine would risk a shortage of its own stockpiles and damage its own readiness for any fight in the future, sources have told Politico. \nOne senior official said:\n\nWith any package, we always consider our readiness and our own stocks while providing Ukraine what it needs on the battlefield. \n\nThat concern, combined with the Biden administration\u2019s worry that Ukraine would use the 190-mile range missiles to attack deep inside Russian territory, is why the US will not be shopping the ATACMS to the frontline any time soon, the news site writes.\nOne potential workaround would be for Kyiv to ask for Washington\u2019s approval to buy ATACMS from an allied country that operates the weapon, using financing from the US, according to one person. \nThe list of ATACMS users includes South Korea, Poland, Romania, Greece, Turkey, Qatar and Bahrain.\n\n\n\n 1.30pm  \n\nMoldova has now reopened its airspace hours after closing it for security reasons, its aviation authority said.\nIn a brief statement, it said it would provide more information later.\n\n\n\n 1.23pm  \n\nTwo Dutch F-35 fighters were scrambled to intercept three Russian military aircraft near Poland, according to the Netherlands\u2019 defence ministry.\nIn a statement late on Monday, translated by Reuters, the defence ministry said:\n\nThe then unknown aircraft approached the Polish Nato area of responsibility from Kaliningrad. After identification, it turned out to be three aircraft: a Russian IL-20M Coot-A that was escorted by two Su-27 Flankers. The Dutch F-35s escorted the formation from a distance and handed over the escort to Nato partners.\n\nPoland\u2019s defence ministry confirmed that Dutch F-35 fighter jets were scrambled on Monday to intercept three Russian aircraft.\nThe ministry told CNN that the F-35 fighters were operating over international waters and Polish airspace was not violated.\n\n\n\n 1.10pm  \n\nThe UK says it will mark the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with a national moment of silence. \nPrime minister Rishi Sunak will lead a one-minute silence at 1100 GMT on 24 February, in an expression of solidarity with Ukraine.\nIn a statement, Sunak said:\n\nAs we approach the anniversary of Russia\u2019s barbaric and deplorable invasion of Ukraine, as a nation we pay tribute to the incredible bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people.\nRussia\u2019s unjustifiable attack brought war and destruction to our continent once again, and it has forced millions from their homes and devastated families across Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\n\n\n 1.05pm  \n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group, has admitted that he founded and financed a company the US has described as a \u201cRussian troll farm\u201d which meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\nPrigozhin, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, has previously admitted to interfering in US elections, but his statement today outlined his specific links to the Internet Research Agency (IRA).\nThe St Petersburg-based company was central to Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election, US intelligence officials have said. \nIn a statement posted to social media, Prigozhin said:\n\nI was never just the financier of the Internet Research Agency. I thought it up, I created it, I managed it for a long time.\n\nThe IRA was \u201ccreated to protect the Russian information space from the West\u2019s boorish and aggressive anti-Russian propaganda\u201d, he added.\nPrigozhin was first sanctioned by the US over his links to Russian IRA in 2018 and charged with conspiracy to defraud the US.\n\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nMoldova has temporarily closed its airspace, its national airline has said.\nIn a statement on Facebook, Air Moldova urged passengers to \u201cplease stay calm\u201d and that it was \u201cwaiting for the resumption of flights\u201d.\nThe news comes at a time of tensions between Moldova and Russia, and a day after Moldova\u2019s president, Maia Sandu, accused Moscow of plotting to destabilise the former Soviet republic.\nSandu complained on Monday that Russia was planning to use foreign saboteurs to bring down her country\u2019s leadership, stop it joining the EU and use it in the war against Ukraine.\nHer comments came after Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had uncovered a Russian intelligence plan \u201cfor the destruction of Moldova\u201d, and days later the country\u2019s government resigned.\nIn response, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry dismissed Sandu\u2019s claims as \u201ccompletely unfounded and unsubstantiated\u201d, and accused Kyiv of trying to draw Moldova \u201cinto a tough confrontation with Russia\u201d.\n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nCrunching through the snow, a few miles from the Russian frontline, there are few visible signs of the activity going on below. At ground level, where the temperature is -6C, the background noise of artillery fire is constant: the pops of outgoing shells and the crumps of incoming ones, as the Russians attack the nearby town of Vuhledar, a fight that has already been going on for three weeks.\nThe military escort turns off into an ordinary dacha, and heads not for the house, but towards a nearby cellar, pushing past a dirty hanging drape. It reveals a flight of steps leading to a heavy metal door and beyond that a hi-tech command post. Inside a stove-warmed room, half a dozen soldiers from Ukraine\u2019s 68th Jaeger infantry brigade monitor the frontline.\n\nHere, the soldiers are armed with laptops. One constantly eyes camera footage, which can come from drones, another the Russians\u2019 radio communications \u2013 both gathering intelligence. The frozen fields on the central screen appear quiet at that moment, but the fighting has been intense nearby, around a small coal mining town that the Ukrainians are desperate to hold.\nVladyslav (Ukraine\u2019s military only allows first names to be used), a major, is the local commander. He explained that Vuhledar matters because it is on an elevated position, and that if the Russians capture it they will have \u201cfire control\u201d on villages to the north. Losing it could force a retreat closer to Kurakhove, 15 miles (24km) behind the current frontline. \u201cNo matter how good our defence line, it is going to become pointless\u201d if the village is lost, he said.\nRead the full report here:\n\n\n\n\n 12.22pm  \nNorway to send 8 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine\n\nNorway has announced it will send eight German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks and other equipment to Ukraine.\nIn a statement, Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said it was \u201cmore crucial than ever to support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom\u201d.\nThe announcement comes a day after St\u00f8re spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a phone call, where the pair discussed Norway\u2019s five-year pledge for Ukraine. \n\nIn addition to the eight Leopards, Norway said it will also send four special purpose tanks from its armoured engineering and bridge layer category, with the exact selection depending on what Ukraine needs the most.\nIt will also set aside funds for ammunition and spare parts, the Norwegian defence ministry said.\nNorway, which shares a border with Russia in the Arctic, has 36 Leopard 2 tanks in total.\n\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nIt appears the Kremlin is concentrating maximum force on capturing the eastern town of Bakhmut before the one-year anniversary of the invasion on 24 February.\nUkraine and its western allies have said over the last week that Russia has already begun a new offensive across the contact line in a bid to gain ground before new western supplies arrive in the spring. \u201cIt is clear that we are in a race of logistics,\u201d Nato head, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters in Brussels on Monday.\n\nA Russian victory in Bakhmut would give the Kremlin a boost after months of stepbacks and a stepping stone to fight for the two next major Ukrainian-controlled towns.\nRussian forces now occupy areas to the north and south of Bakhmut and have been attempting to overwhelm Ukrainian forces by ceaselessly throwing streams of infantry soldiers at the Ukrainian frontlines.\n\u201cThe Russians next to Bakhmut are trying to rely more on manpower than on armored vehicles,\u201d said Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s forces in the east.\nHe told Ukraine\u2019s Telemarathon on Sunday the Russians were using small tactical groups to try to approach Ukrainian troops and engage them in close combat battles \u2013 not risking their heavy equipment in the current weather conditions and Ukraine\u2019s ability to target it.\nThe battle to control Bakhmut began in June and has become one of the war\u2019s bloodiest battles, with Russia concentrating a huge number of resources on capturing the town.\nSocial media posts indicate that Ukraine has suffered thousands of casualties in and around Bakhmut, particularly since autumn Russia mobilised thousands of men in October. Drone footage published by Ukraine\u2019s military as well as graveyards in southern Russia shows that Russian losses have been astronomical.\n\nUpdated at 12.08pm GMT\n\n\n 11.47am  \nUkrainian forces 'destroy bridge near Bakhmut' but deny plan to retreat\n\nUkrainian forces blew up a bridge near the eastern town of Bakhmut on Monday, according to a local Donetsk region news site, in a sign that Ukraine may be planning to retreat.\nThe blown-up bridge is reportedly located between Bakhmut and Konstantivka, the next major town under Ukrainian control, according to Eastern Edition, a local news Telegram channel, which posted videos from the area.\nUkrainian forces, for now, deny they intend to leave the town, despite six months of heavy fighting and reportedly dwindling stockpiles.\nAside from the blown-up bridge, the Donetsk region regional administration announced new measures restricting journalists\u2019 access to Bakhmut on Monday, citing the danger of Russian reconnaissance groups attempting to penetrate the town. \nThe Russian assault on Bakhmut has been led by Wagner, a private Russian military formation with a reputation for ruthlessness. Wagner\u2019s sponsor, Russian Yevheny Prigozhin, recruited thousands of Russian prisoners to bulk up the force in the autumn, offering them the promise of freedom after six months if they fight in Ukraine.\nUkraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in early February that Ukraine was determined to hold Bakhmut, describing it as \u201cFortress Bakhmut\u201d. \nBut, according to the Washington Post, US officials have tried to persuade Zelenskiy to prioritise preparations for a counteroffensive to take back what the US considers more important territory. US officials emphasised that time was of the essence as the level of US support cannot be guaranteed.\n\nUpdated at 11.57am GMT\n\n\n 11.43am  \n\nOne Ukrainian worker was killed and many have been hurt in recent days trying to repair the power network following Russian airstrikes, according to energy minister German Galushchenko.\nRussian unleashed a wave of airstrikes on Friday, targeting Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure and causing emergency power outages for millions of people.\nUkraine\u2019s air force said Russia had fired 71 cruise missiles, of which 61 were shot down. At least 17 missiles hit the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia in an hour in the heaviest attack since the war began last February, local officials said.\nIn a statement, Galushchenko and Ukraine\u2019s grid operator Ukrenergy said the country was producing enough energy to meet consumers\u2019 needs.\nHe said:\n\nWith the incredible efforts of energy workers, it\u2019s possible to keep the generation, delivery and distribution of electricity at the required level to meet the needs of consumers. These successes have their own high price, the price of human life. In frontline areas, energy workers work under fire and in dangerous places.\n\nThere had been a number of accidents in recent days, he said, including incidents in which workers were hurt at energy companies in the southern region of Mykolayiv and in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. He added:\n\nMines blew up the cars of repairmen of Mykolaivbolenergo and Kharkivbolenergo. There is a dead person, many wounded.\n\nUkrenergo said power plants were now generating enough electricity to cover consumption, and said electricity may have to be limited later on Tuesday in Odesa after damage to the network there. \nIn a video address on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed the repair efforts by Ukrainian energy workers, praising the speed at which they had restored power to the nation.\n\n\n\n 11.27am  \n\nUkraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has tweeted a photo from a meeting of the so-called Ramstein group of Ukraine allies.\nNato defence ministers are in Brussels for a two-day meeting, and although Kyiv has renewed calls for fighter jets to frustrate Russia\u2019s invasion, Nato allies are more concerned about how to keep up a steady supply of ammunition to Ukraine without depleting their own stockpiles.\nAsked what military aid his country is seeking now, Reznikov showed reporters an image of a fighter jet. Asked where he hoped they might come from, he replied:\n\nFrom the sky.\n\n\nHello everyone. It\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. \n\nUpdated at 11.28am GMT\n\n\n 11.02am  \nSummary of the day so far \u2026\n\n\nNato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday it was more important that Finland and Sweden\u2019s applications to join the alliance were ratified quickly than together. The two countries applied to join Nato following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and their membership bids have been ratified by all allies except Hungary and Turkey. Turkey is widely seen as the main hold-up. Ankara has demanded that both countries take a tougher line against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the European Union.\nUkraine has urgent requirements in terms of more military aid, said US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin on Tuesday, as he also reaffirmed that the United States and Nato allies in general were there to support Ukraine over the long haul. \u201cThat shared resolve will sustain Ukraine\u2019s momentum in the weeks ahead,\u201d said Austin at a Nato meeting in Brussels. \u201cThe Kremlin is still betting that it can wait us out.\u201d\nRussia has again criticised Nato over its stance towards the war in Ukraine. \u201cNato is an organisation which is hostile to us and which proves this hostility every day,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \u201cIt is trying its best to make its involvement in the conflict around Ukraine as clear as possible.\u201d\nGermany has signed contracts with Rheinmetall to restart the production of ammunition for the Gepard anti-aircraft guns it has delivered to Kyiv, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said on Tuesday.\nShipping and coastal communities around Ukraine\u2019s major seaport hub of Odesa received a warning from military officials on Tuesday over the high risk of naval mines drifting along the coast and washing ashore. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of using mines off the Ukrainian coast, which prevents safe navigation in the region. The Soviet-made mines were anchored, but in a storm some of them could come loose and be carried by the current.\nUkrainian defenders who have held out for months are braced for new ground attacks, Ukrainian military officials have said. The eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is facing heavy artillery fire, according to local officials. \u201cThe city, the city\u2019s suburbs, the entire perimeter, and essentially the entire Bakhmut direction and Kostyantynivka are under crazy, chaotic shelling,\u201d said Volodymyr Nazarenko, deputy commander of Ukraine\u2019s Svoboda battalion, on Monday. The Ukrainian military reported 16 settlements had been bombarded near Bakhmut.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Ukrainian soldiers for \u201cpreventing the occupiers from encircling Bakhmut\u201d. The capture of Bakhmut would give Russia a new foothold in the Donetsk region and constitute a rare victory after months of setbacks.\nIn the last three days, Wagner Group forces have almost certainly made further small gains around the northern outskirts of Bakhmut, including into the village of Krasna Hora, the UK Ministry of Defence said Tuesday. However, organised Ukrainian defence continues in the area and the tactical Russian advance to the south of the town has likely made little progress, the latest British intelligence report adds.\n\n\n\n\n 10.26am  \n\nUkraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that the head of the press office for the Ukrainian region of Kherson, Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, has said that the Russian army today shelled the carriageway of one of the major regional roads and also damaged a hospital facility. There were no dead or injured, he said. The claims have not been independently verified.\n\nUpdated at 10.53am GMT\n\n\n 10.02am  \n\nThe Kremlin has again criticised Nato over its stance towards the war in Ukraine, saying the military alliance demonstrated its hostility towards Russia every day, and was becoming more and more involved in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\u201cNato is an organisation which is hostile to us and which proves this hostility every day,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.\n\u201cIt is trying its best to make its involvement in the conflict around Ukraine as clear as possible,\u201d Reuters reports Peskov added.\n\nUpdated at 10.54am GMT\n\n\n 9.46am  \nStoltenberg: more important Sweden and Finland join Nato quickly than join at the same time\n\nNato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Tuesday it was more important that Finland and Sweden\u2019s applications to join the alliance were ratified quickly rather than together.\nThe two countries applied to join Nato following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February last year and their membership bids have been ratified by all allies except Hungary and Turkey.\nTurkey is widely seen as the main hold-up and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has indicated his country could ratify Finland\u2019s application while not going ahead with Sweden\u2019s.\nReuters reports western officials have said they would prefer both countries to join Nato together, partly because it would be easier to integrate them at the same time into Nato\u2019s military structures.\n\nBut Stoltenberg, speaking before a meeting of Nato defence ministers at alliance headquarters in Brussels, suggested that was a secondary consideration.\n\u201cThe main question is not whether Finland and Sweden are ratified together. The main question is that they are both ratified as full members as soon as possible,\u201d he told reporters.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that both will be full members and I\u2019m working hard to get both ratified as soon as possible.\u201d\nAnkara has demanded that both countries take a tougher line against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the European Union.\n\nUpdated at 10.56am GMT\n\n\n 9.33am  \n\nUkraine has urgent requirements in terms of more military aid, said the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, on Tuesday, as he also reaffirmed that the United States and Nato allies in general were there to support Ukraine over the long haul.\n\u201cThat shared resolve will sustain Ukraine\u2019s momentum in the weeks ahead,\u201d said Austin at a Nato meeting in Brussels. \u201cThe Kremlin is still betting that it can wait us out.\u201d\nAustin is in Brussels for the meeting of Nato defence ministers.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.56am GMT\n\n\n 9.27am  \n\nHere is a selection of images that have been sent over the news wires showing Ukrainian service personnel in the contested city of Bakhmut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.59am  \n\nThe air alert that started earlier in Ukraine has ended. It lasted around one hour and fifty minutes. There are no reports of any strikes materialising.\n\n\n\n 8.52am  \n\nMy colleague Esther Addley has been speaking to some Ukrainian refugees who have come to the UK and set up businesses:\nFor Nataliia Horbenko, moving to north London from Kyiv last year to set up a business in Britain was her contribution to the war effort. \u201cI am a soldier, not at the frontline of the war, but at the economic front. My aim is to increase the economy of my homeland of Ukraine, and I think I could be successful in this task.\u201d\nBack home she was a logistics manager in a transport company and she speaks passionately (\u201cI belong to business \u2013 I like logistics\u201d) about the opportunity she saw to do her bit.\n\u201cWe [Ukrainians] needed to make a decision and be very brave, but we had no choice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to keep our minds very clear, be focused and do what we are good at. I\u2019m good at logistics. So why couldn\u2019t I help my Ukraine and also be helpful for your country by paying taxes here? It will be mutual cooperation.\u201d\nRead more here: \u2018We live in the here and now\u2019 \u2013 Ukrainian refugees starting businesses in the UK\n\n\n\n\n 8.32am  \n\nGermany has signed contracts with Rheinmetall to restart the production of ammunition for the Gepard anti-aircraft guns it has delivered to Kyiv, the German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe will quickly start our own production of Gepard ammunition at Rheinmetall. I am very happy we have been able to guarantee the delivery of this important part of air defence,\u201d Reuters reports Pistorius said before a meeting with Nato ministers in Brussels.\n\nUpdated at 8.52am GMT\n\n\n 8.09am  \n\nRussia\u2019s state-owned Tass news agency is reporting claims that yesterday Russian forces destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot in the Kherson region. It quotes emergency services in the Russian-held portion of occupied Kherson saying:\n\nYesterday, artillery fire destroyed a warehouse with ammunition near the village of Antonivka. Four vehicles were destroyed, the losses of the armed forces amounted to 15 people dead and 12 wounded.\n\nThe claim has not been independently verified. Kherson is one of the four regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation claimed to annex late last year.\n\nUpdated at 9.07am GMT\n\n\n 7.51am  \n\nWith the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine rapidly approaching, Agence France-Presse has gathered together a series of statistics about the war so far:\n\nAccording to the latest estimates from Norway, the conflict has wounded or killed 180,000 Russian soldiers and 100,000 Ukrainian troops. Other western sources estimate the war has caused 150,000 casualties on each side.\nIn total, 30,000 to 40,000 civilians have lost their lives nationwide in the conflict, western sources say. In late January, the United Nations estimated that 18,000 civilians had been killed or wounded in the fighting, but said the real figure was likely much higher.\nUkrainian authorities say at least 400 children have been killed. Kyiv also alleges that Moscow has forcibly deported more than 16,000 children to Russia or areas controlled by Moscow-backed separatists.\nMore than 8 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee Ukraine since the war broke out, the UN refugee agency says, the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. Neighbouring Poland hosts the largest share of these refugees, with more than 1.5 million of them. More than 5 million people have been displaced inside the country.\nLandmines are also a threat to civilians. Kyiv says 30% of Ukrainian territory has been contaminated with landmines, while Human Rights Watch accuses Ukrainian troops of having planted banned anti-personnel landmines in the eastern region of Izium. Experts warn demining could take decades.\nAbout 65,000 suspected war crimes have been reported throughout the war, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, says. UN investigators have accused Russia of committing war crimes on a \u201cmassive scale\u201d in Ukraine including bombings, executions, torture and sexual violence.\nThe \u201cactive\u201d frontline runs north to south along 1,500 km (900 miles) of territory, according to Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.\nThe World Bank in October said it expected the country\u2019s economy to contract by 35% in 2022, while the Kyiv School of Economics in January estimated it would cost $138bn (\u00a3113bn) to replace all the infrastructure ravaged by war. The war has caused more than $34bn in economic losses in the agricultural sector, it said in November.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.50am GMT\n\n\n 7.43am  \n\nUkraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne has posted its latest summary of events to Telegram, reporting:\n\nSince midnight, Russian troops shelled the Kherson community five times, one person was injured. In the morning, the Ochakiv community in the Mykolayiv region was also shelled \u2013 no people were injured.\nDuring the past day, two people were killed and three others were injured due to Russian shelling in the Kherson region. One person died and three were injured in Donetsk region.\n\n\n\n\n 7.27am  \n\nShipping and coastal communities around Ukraine\u2019s major seaport hub of Odesa received a warning from military officials on Tuesday over the high risk of naval mines drifting along the coast and washing ashore.\nUkraine and Russia have accused each other of using mines off the Ukrainian coast, which prevents safe navigation in the region. The Soviet-made mines were anchored, but in a storm some of them could come loose and be carried by the current, Reuters reports.\n\u201cThere is a high probability of naval mines breaking off their anchors and washing up on the shore, as well as drifting along the coast,\u201d Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson of Odesa military administration, wrote on Telegram messaging app.\n\u201cSince March last year, Russia has continued to use anti-ship mines on anchors as an unguided weapon against Ukraine,\u201d he said in a separate video.\n\n\n\n 7.16am  \n\nAn air alert has been declared across several southern areas of Ukraine including Mykolaiv, Kherson and Odesa.\nEarlier, Volodymyr Litinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in the Kherson region reported on Telegram that Russian shelling in the previous 24 hours had damaged \u201cthe hospital building, residential buildings and farm buildings\u201d in the area, but that \u201cfortunately, there were no civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nThis is Martin Belam in London taking over the live blog.\n\n\n\n\n 6.57am  \n\nMoscow continues to leverage its relationship with Iran to provide military support for the war in Ukraine, according to the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War.\nThe Wagner Group continues to disseminate deliberately brutal extrajudicial execution videos and generally graphic content, the group said in its latest intelligence report.\n\n\n\n\n 6.56am  \nRussia's Wagner group makes small gains around Bakhmut: UK MoD\n\nIn the last three days, Wagner Group forces have almost certainly made further small gains around the northern outskirts of the contested Donbas town of Bakhmut, including into the village of Krasna Hora, the UK Ministry of Defence has said.\nHowever, organised Ukrainian defence continues in the area and the tactical Russian advance to the south of the town has likely made little progress, the latest British intelligence report adds.\nIn the north, in Kremina-Svatove sector of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Luhansk region, Russian forces are making \u201ccontinuous offensive efforts\u201d though each local attack \u201cremains on too small a scale to achieve a significant breakthrough\u201d.\n\nOverall, the current operational picture suggests that Russian forces are being given orders to advance in most sectors, but that they have not massed sufficient offensive combat power on any one axis to achieve a decisive effect.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.51am  \n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry has rejected claims made on Monday by Moldova\u2019s president that Moscow is plotting to destabilise the situation in the former Soviet republic.\n\u201cSuch claims are completely unfounded and unsubstantiated,\u201d Reuters repots Russia\u2019s foreign ministry as saying in a statement on Tuesday. \n\n\n\n 6.45am  \n\nRussia is reportedly promising its soldiers a daily cash allowance as motivation to fight, Ukraine\u2019s military has claimed.\nThe general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces alleged in its morning briefing:\n\nIn order to motivate the personnel for offensives, propaganda about daily cash allowances for participation in assault operations is distributed in enemy units. \nIn addition, an additional payment was announced to each invader for a kilometre of advancement on Ukrainian land.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 6.35am  \nNew Russian offensive underway, Nato chief says\n\nA major new Russian offensive has begun in Ukraine, Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said.\nSpeaking ahead of today\u2019s meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, Stoltenberg said Russia was \u201csending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities\u201d.\n\nI think the reality [is] that we\u2019re seeing the start already, because we\u2019re seeing what Russia is just now, what President Putin do now, is sending thousands and thousands of more troops, accepting a very high rate of casualty, taking big losses, but putting pressure on the Ukrainians. And what Russia lacks in quality, they try to compensate in quantity, meaning that the leadership, the logistics, the equipment, the training, don\u2019t have the same level as the Ukrainian forces, but they have more forces.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 6.16am  \nBakhmut under heavy fire\n\nThe eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is facing heavy artillery fire, according to local officials. \nUkrainian defenders who have held out for months are bracing for new ground attacks, Ukrainian military officials have said. \n\u201cThe city, the city\u2019s suburbs, the entire perimeter, and essentially the entire Bakhmut direction and Kostyantynivka are under crazy, chaotic shelling,\u201d said Volodymyr Nazarenko, deputy commander of Ukraine\u2019s Svoboda battalion.\n\nThe Ukrainian military also reported 16 settlements had been bombarded near Bakhmut.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Ukrainian soldiers for \u201cpreventing the occupiers from encircling Bakhmut\u201d. The capture of Bakhmut would give Russia a new foothold in the Donetsk region and constitute a rare victory after months of setbacks.\n\n\n\n 6.05am  \nNato chief urges speed of military aid, delivery of jets 'will take time'\n\nNato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he expects the issue of aircraft to be discussed during today\u2019s meeting in Brussels, but stressed that Ukraine instead needs urgent support on the ground.\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting during a pre-ministerial press conference on Monday, he said support for Ukraine \u201chas evolved as the war has evolved\u201d.\nIn the early stages of the war Stoltenberg said there was enormous focus on javelins and anti-tank weapons before switching to the delivery of advanced modern artillery. \n\u201cThen air defence has been a main focus and now heavy weaponry; Strykers, Bradleys, infantry fighting vehicles, mortars from Germany, and also main battle tanks,\u201d he said.\nReferring to the contentious discussion of providing jets, he said:\n\nAnd as you have seen from media, there is now a discussion going on also on the question of aircraft, and I expect that also to be addressed tomorrow at the meetings here in Brussels.\nBut let me add two things and that is that one is speed, urgency. Because whatever the opinion may be about aircraft, that will take time.\nWhat is needed now is urgent support for Ukraine. So my top priority is to ensure that the pledges Allies have made for infantry fighting vehicles, for armour, for battle tanks, that are delivered as soon as possible because every day counts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 5.55am  \nNato defence ministers to increase ammunition stockpile\n\nDefence ministers from several Nato countries allied to Kyiv will meet in Brussels later today to discuss possible further military aid.\nNato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Nato planned to increase its ammunition stockpile targets as Kyiv is burning through shells much faster than western countries are able to produce.\nIn a statement published ahead of the summit, he said:\n\nIt is clear that we are in a race of logistics.\nKey capabilities like ammunition, fuel, and spare parts must reach Ukraine before Russia can seize the initiative on the battlefield.Speed will save lives.\u201d\n\n\nStoltenberg said Nato partners needed to ramp up production and invest in production capacity.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is consuming an enormous amount of munitions, and depleting Allied stockpiles.\nThe current rate of Ukraine\u2019s ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production. This puts our defence industries under strain.\nWe need to ramp up production. And invest in our production capacity.\u201d\n\nHe also said he expected the issue of aircraft to be discussed, but stressed that Ukraine needed urgent support on the ground now.\n\n\n\n 5.37am  \nSummary and welcome\n\nHello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Samantha Lock and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold.\nThe eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is facing heavy artillery fire from Russia\u2019s forces, according to local officials. The Ukrainian military earlier reported that 16 nearby settlements had been bombarded.\nA two-day meeting of Nato defence ministers is set to begin today in Brussels where leaders will discuss possible further military aid for Ukraine.\nNato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he expected the issue of aircraft to be discussed, but stressed that Ukraine needed urgent support on the ground now.\nHe also said Nato planned to increase its ammunition stockpile targets as Kyiv is burning through shells much faster than western countries are able to produce.\nIt\u2019s 7.30am in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:\n\nA major new Russian offensive has begun, Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Speaking ahead of a two-day meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, Stoltenberg said Russia was \u201csending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities\u201d. Nato planned to increase its ammunition stockpile targets and he expected possible supply of aircraft to Ukraine to be discussed. Stoltenberg said Ukraine\u2019s use of ammunition was \u201cmany times higher than our current rate of production\u201d.\nUkrainian defenders who have held out for months are braced for new ground attacks, Ukrainian military officials have said. The eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is facing heavy artillery fire, according to local officials. \u201cThe city, the city\u2019s suburbs, the entire perimeter, and essentially the entire Bakhmut direction and Kostyantynivka are under crazy, chaotic shelling,\u201d said Volodymyr Nazarenko, deputy commander of Ukraine\u2019s Svoboda battalion. The Ukrainian military reported 16 settlements had been bombarded near Bakhmut.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Ukrainian soldiers for \u201cpreventing the occupiers from encircling Bakhmut\u201d. The capture of Bakhmut would give Russia a new foothold in the Donetsk region and constitute a rare victory after months of setbacks.\nUkraine\u2019s top general and the top US army commander in Europe have discussed further military aid for Kyiv. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi from Ukraine talked to the commander in chief of Europe\u2019s combined Nato forces, US General Christopher Cavoli, ahead of the Nato defence ministers\u2019 meeting. \u201cWe discussed the issue of supplying international military aid to Ukraine and training our units on the territory of partner countries,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry quoted Zaluzhnyi as saying.\nUkraine\u2019s allies have begun training Ukrainian troops on the Leopard 2 and other modern battle tanks. Germany started training Ukrainian soldiers on the Leopards on Monday at an army base in the northern town of Munster. Ukrainian troops are also being trained by Polish, Canadian and Norwegian instructors at a military base in Swietoszow, south-west Poland.\nTwo Dutch F-35 fighters have intercepted a formation of three Russian military aircraft near Poland and escorted them out. The Netherlands\u2019 defence ministry said: \u201cThe then unknown aircraft approached the Polish Nato area of responsibility from Kaliningrad,\u201d according to a Reuters translation of the ministry\u2019s statement. \u201cAfter identification, it turned out to be three aircraft: a Russian IL-20M Coot-A that was escorted by two Su-27 Flankers. The Dutch F-35s escorted the formation from a distance and handed over the escort to Nato partners.\u201d\nMoldova\u2019s president, Maia Sandu, has accused Russia of planning to use foreign saboteurs to overthrow her country\u2019s government, prevent it from joining the EU and use it in the war against Ukraine. Sandu\u2019s comments on Monday came after Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country had intercepted plans by Russian secret services \u201cfor the destruction of Moldova\u201d \u2013 this was later backed up by Moldovan intelligence officials.\nAn unverified video is being circulated on social media that appears to show the murder with a sledgehammer of a former Russian mercenary who fled the Wagner group while fighting in Ukraine. The clip is similar to one that showed the killing of another Wagner fighter, Yevgeny Nuzhin, in November last year. Wagner\u2019s founder declined to say whether the apparent victim had been killed or not.\nThe UN human rights office said it had recorded 7,199 civilian deaths and 11,756 wounded since Russia\u2019s February invasion, mostly from shelling, missiles and airstrikes. However, it believed the actual figure was far higher.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.59am GMT\n"

                    "body": "Mercedes Car W13 Engine Mercedes Principal Toto Wolff Debut France 1954 GPs 249 Titles 8 Last season Champions. Struggled in testing with a car that may prove to be more of a diva than previous models. It suffered from heavy \u201cporpoising\u201d (ie the car heavily jarring up and down on a straight) and a consequent lack of balance, brake-locking and understeer. Believe they can solve the issues and in doing so will have a very quick car but this may be the most trying opening to a campaign they have faced for many years. Drivers Lewis Hamilton (GB, age 37) No 44 Debut Australia 2007 Wins 103 Poles 103 Titles 7 Last season 2nd. Strongly motivated by the bitter disappointment of being controversially denied his eighth title in 2021\u2019s season finale, Hamilton is geared up for a fight. He drove as well as he ever has last season and there are no signs he has lost any of his remarkable edge. If Mercedes can deliver the car he will be fearsomely hard to beat.  George Russell (GB, 24) No 63 Debut Australia 2019 Wins 0 Best race finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 15th Last season 15th. Delivered well at the back of the field for Williams but faces the toughest test of his career at the front of the grid and partnered with Hamilton. Has real pace, confidence and is clearly relishing this challenge. Should he step up to the challenge, how the dynamic within the team and across the garage develops will be fascinating.  Red Bull Car RB18 Engine Red Bull Principal Christian Horner Debut Australia 2005 GPs 325 Titles 4 Last season 2nd. Looked comfortably to have the best car in testing. Well-balanced, quick and reliable it was crucially less prone to porpoising than almost any other team, strong over the bumps and on long runs. Their final updates were a real step forward and on the back of a standout last season are confident and fired-up again. Enter as favourites for the opening rounds.  Drivers Max Verstappen (Neth, 24) No 1 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 20 Poles 13 Titles 1 Last season Champion. The Dutchman is defending a title he genuinely earned last season, despite the manner in which it was clinched. He drove exceptionally well, if on occasion too aggressively but can be sublime. Fearless and unintimidated, he is soaring in confidence with that first title and has every chance to make it two this year. Sergio P\u00e9rez (Mex, 32) No 11 Debut Australia 2011 Wins 2 Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 4th Last season 4th. Performed well in his first season with Red Bull but was comprehensively beaten by Verstappen. Will be expected to step up if he is to earn a seat beyond 2022. Needs to qualify stronger as Red Bull will expect a partner for Verstappen at the front and the Mexican, who has pace and touch, must deliver. Ferrari Car F1-75 Engine Ferrari Principal Mattia Binotto Debut Monaco 1950 GPs 1,030 Titles 16 Last season 3rd. Having poured last year\u2019s resources into this car, the Scuderia are hopeful of ending a win drought stretching back to 2019. They have every chance, the car is clearly quick, well-balanced, reliable and, crucially, the drivers are at ease with it. With an improved engine and a superb driver lineup, expectations are high. Drivers Charles Leclerc (Mon, 24) No 16 Debut Australia 2018 Wins 2 Poles 9 Titles 0 Best season finish 4th Last season 7th. Ferrari have huge faith in their young charger who has proved he can win but has yet to have the machinery to challenge consistently. If the car is there Leclerc will take it to Hamilton and Verstappen with verve. Out-drove an average car last year and will absolutely shine in a resurgent Ferrari.  Carlos Sainz Jr (Sp, 27) No 55 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 0 Best race finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 5th Last season 5th. Settled in well in his first season at Ferrari and against Leclerc around whom the team has been forged. The Spaniard has proved he has real talent with a fine touch and real consistency. Capable of at least matching Leclerc and if he does so having found his feet at Ferrari the pair will be a formidable partnership. McLaren Car MCL36 Engine Mercedes Principal Andreas Seidl Debut Monaco 1966 GPs 902 Titles 8 Last season 4th. Building on an upward curve from their recent nadir the team have produced an impressively quick car but one stymied in the second test by a front-brake cooling problem. Unable to solve it they lost time and long-running data. Solving the issue is paramount and should unleash a ride very much on the heels of the big three.  Drivers Lando Norris (GB, 22) No 4 Debut Australia 2019 Wins 0 Best race finish 2nd Poles 1 Titles 0 Best season finish 6th Last season 6th. Beyond the title fight, Norris was the standout last season as he produced some of the best performances of his career. Often out-driving quicker cars, Norris has developed his pace with some fine judgment, decisive overtaking and is utterly unintimidated vying with the world champions against whom he is now being measured. A first win is easily achievable. Daniel Ricciardo (Aus, 32) No 3 Debut GB 2011 Wins 8 Poles 3 Titles 0 Best season finish 3rd Last season 8th. Struggled to adapt to his new ride at McLaren but began finding his feet in the final third of the season. Delivered a consummate victory at Monza, a reminder of this talent but this year will be expected to show his real form from the off in the new car. If he does, McLaren will have one of the best lineups on the grid. Alpine Car A522 Engine Renault Principal Otmar Szafnauer Debut Bahrain 2021 GPs 22 Last season 5th. Had the worst attack of the porpoises in early testing but appeared to have a handle on it by the close. The former Renault outfit are still in their rebuilding phase and taking on Szafnauer was a positive step. Likely once more to be mired in another tightly contested midfield fight but with a driver lineup able to shine when given the chance.  DriversFernando Alonso (Spa, 40) No 14 Debut Australia 2001 Wins 32 Poles 22 Titles 2 Last season 10th. Still able to turn in eye-catching drives, Alonso remains ambitious and convinced he has lost none of his touch. The pace and judgment returned quickly last year after his sabbatical from F1, including a fine top-three finish in Qatar but he came back to compete and Alpine need to start coming good on their promise to give him the machinery to do so. Esteban Ocon (Fra, 25) No 31 Debut Belgium 2016 Wins 1 Poles 0 Best qualifying 3rd Titles 0 Best season finish 8th Last season 11th. Impressively well matched with Alonso last year and confirmed his promise with a deserved inaugural win in Hungary. Alpine recognised his talent, signing him until 2024. He is settled now and in the most promising seat of his career. Likely to be spurred on once more by Alonso, Ocon is a vital asset in the midfield battle. AlphaTauri Car AT03 Engine Red Bull Principal Franz Tost Debut Austria 2020 GPs 39 Titles 0 Best finish 6th Last season 6th. Reliable and productive in testing, AlphaTauri put in an impressive number of laps and looked solid and pacey throughout. The Red Bull engine (effectively last year\u2019s Honda unit) is clearly strong. If the drivers can return consistent points they have every chance to make life torrid for nearby rivals and even steal a podium if given the chance.  Drivers Pierre Gasly (Fra, 26) No 10 Debut Malaysia 2017 Wins 1 Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best season finish 7th Last season 9th. Still eager to make his point that he deserves another shot at the Red Bull seat, Gasly repeatedly showed some superb licks last season. His qualifying was often well beyond the expectations of the car and he is clearly more comfortable with the team than he was in the crucible of driving alongside Verstappen. Should go well. Yuki Tsunoda (Jpn, 21) No 22 Debut Bahrain 2021 Best race finish 4th Poles 0 Best qualifying 7th Titles 0 Best season finish 14th Last season 14th. Showed flashes of brilliance but was let down by too many unforced errors in his rookie season. Has a second chance to come good, he is fast but must temper the pace with control, eliminate the crashes and return good points if the Red Bull machine is not to discard him as too unreliable. This is make or break for Tsunoda. Aston Martin Car AMR22 Engine Mercedes Principal Mike Krack Debut Netherlands 1959 GPs 27 Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th. Quietly efficient in testing, Aston kept their heads down, put in the laps and they look strong on it. Not searching for lap time they did have impressive long-run speed and there were approving acknowledgments of the car from the drivers. The new principal heads a team that may well emerge to lead the midfield.  Drivers Sebastian Vettel (Ger, 34) No 5 Debut USA 2007 Wins 53 Poles 57 Titles 4 Last season 12th. Appears to be enjoying driving a whole lot more since moving from Ferrari to Aston and in the cut and thrust of the midfield dogfight. The team are still expanding with a new factory and grand ambitions and Vettel seems to be at home. Proved last season he was able to turn in a quality shift and should lead the team in doing so again but will miss the opener due to Covid-19. Lance Stroll (Can, 23) No 18 Debut Australia 2017 Best race finish 3rd Poles 1 Titles 0 Best season finish 11th Last season 13th. A solid if unremarkable season last year did little to throw off the label that comes with racing for a team your father owns, but Stroll does occasionally shine, especially in qualifying. If Aston have a good car it will be perhaps the acid test of his career. With the team\u2019s grand ambitions Stroll needs to prove he can deliver for the old man. Williams Car FW44 Engine Mercedes Principal Jost Capito Debut Spain 1977 GPs 766 Titles 9 Last season 8th. Another year of building back under new owners after the Williams family sold the team and progress is not expected to be drastic. Enjoyed reasonable testing but lost time with a brake fire that was costly. However, they did good mileage, the car was stable and appears to be a solid platform on which to build. Can aim to challenge to be top of the back of the grid.  Drivers Alexander Albon (Thai, 25) No 23 Debut Australia 2019 Wins 0 Best race finish 3rd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best season finish 7th Last season N/A (7th in 2020). Returning after his torrid time alongside Verstappen at Red Bull and then a year out in DTM, this is a chance Albon will grasp. An opportunity to prove himself out of the spotlight, Russell has already shown how he could shine at the back with Williams and on his day Albon is capable of similar feats. A real asset for the team. Nicholas Latifi (Can, 26) No 6 Debut Austria 2020 Wins 0 Best race finish 7th Poles 0 Best qualifying 10th Titles 0 Best season finish 17th Last season 17th. Entering his third season, Latifi had been overshadowed by Russell and needs to prove he brings more than backing to the party. On occasion can put together quick laps but has yet to do so consistently. Williams are ambitious and at the very least Latifi must begin to match their aims by extracting the maximum from the car. Alfa Romeo Car C42 Engine Ferrari Principal Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur Debut Britain 1950 GPs 170 Titles 0 Best finish 6th Last season 9th. Reliability problems plagued the first test \u2013 porpoising once more often to blame \u2013 but Alfa followed it with better running in Bahrain. They are on top of the bouncing and with the Ferrari engine look to have a quick car. Reliability remains the main concern but if they nail it Alfa could be the dark horse at the back.  Drivers Valtteri Bottas (Fin, 32) No 77 Debut Australia 2013 Wins 10 Poles 20 Best season finish 2nd Last season 3rd. Thoroughly outraced by Hamilton at Mercedes, the Finn was not returning nearly good enough performances last season but may find a new lease of life at Alfa. When the car and indeed track are to his liking he can produce and will be expected to lead the team\u2019s charge, a role he was never going to assume at Mercedes. Guanyu Zhou (Chi, 22) No 24 Rookie season Last year 3rd in F2. China\u2019s first F1 driver will be enormous in his home country but his credentials beyond the backing he brings are unspectacular. He failed to light up F2 in his three seasons in the championship but did at least return some wins on his way to third last year. Faces a daunting task in being measured against the vastly more experienced Bottas. Haas Car VF-22 Engine Ferrari Principal Guenther Steiner Debut Australia 2016 GPs 122 Titles 0 Best finish 5th Last season 10th. Endured a torrid build up, dropping their Russian title sponsor and driver Nikita Mazepin but Haas may yet emerge all the better for it. Having Kevin Magnussen back in the car is a boon and having written off last year in favour of developing the new ride appears to have paid off with no little pace in testing and Mick Schumacher very pleased with the results.  Drivers Kevin Magnussen (Den, 29) No 20 Debut Australia 2014 Best race finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best season finish 9th Last season N/A (20th 2020). Just the fillip the team needed, Magnussen knows them well having raced for Haas from 2017-2020. He was dropped in favour of the Mazepin millions and went to race in sportscars last year but has jumped at the chance of another shot in F1. Brings experience, aggression and a singular determination not to give up, all qualities Haas will need. The back of the field is a livelier place for his return. Mick Schumacher (Ger, 23) No 47 Debut Bahrain 2021 Best race finish 12th Poles 0 Best qualifying 14th Titles 0 Best season finish 19th Last season 19th. Endured a tough rookie year in a woeful car well, getting his head down and displaying the famous Schumacher work ethic. Showed some pace but also admitted to making needless and often costly mistakes. With a more competitive car will face the real test against a teammate who is a known quantity and talented. Matching or beating Magnussen would be an impressive feat."

                    "body": "  5.34pm    We\u2019re winding up the blog now, but it has been an extraordinary and fascinating, if not always cheering, couple of weeks at Cop. You can turn to my colleague Fiona Harvey\u2019s long read on exactly what happened at Cop27 for all the drama \u2013 and the long, dull moments where nothing seemed to happen too. But what happened today as the conference centre finally shut its doors?  John Kerry called on China to do more, saying: \u201cAs we continue to lead along with our allies and partners in the fight to protect our planet, the United States will also continue to press major emitters like China to significantly enhance their ambition to align with what science says is necessary.\u201d The EU president called the deal a \u201csmall step towards climate justice\u201d but added that much more needed to be done. The G77 bloc along with climate justice organisations welcomed the creation of a loss and damage fund as a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d as War on Want\u2019s Asad Rehman put it. Everyone got a closer look at the text and picked out the new arrivals, including a first ever mention in the cover text for \u201ctipping points\u201d, and \u201cnature-based solutions\u201d. And there was plenty of disappointment too, as people reflected on the failures \u2013 in particular the failure to incorporate the goal of phasing out fossil fuels.  It\u2019s been a rollercoaster. Next year\u2019s Cop will be in the United Arab Emirates. Thank you for joining us. If you\u2019d like to support the Guardian just nip in here because we couldn\u2019t do any of this without you all. See you in UAE.   Updated at 5.50pm GMT    4.48pm    My colleague Nina Lakhani has reported on the way that Pakistan was at the forefront of the battle to get the loss and damage fund finally set up this year.  The horrific floods that left a third of the country underwater earlier this year only spurred the resolve.   Pakistan brought that resolve to the negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh and, as president of the G77 plus China negotiating bloc, succeeded in keeping developing countries united on loss and damage \u2013 despite efforts by some rich countries to divide them. Its chief negotiator, Nabeel Munir, a career diplomat, was backed by a team of savvy veteran negotiators who had witnessed the devastation and suffering from the floods, which caused $30bn (\u00a325bn) of damage and economic losses. Every day, Munir repeated the same message: \u201cLoss and damage is not charity, it\u2019s about climate justice.\u201d       4.17pm    The conference has brought little relief for the family of the British-Egyptian jailed hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah. His family were allowed to visit him a couple of days ago, and found him exhausted and weak.  My colleague Ruth Michaelson has reported previously that \u201cAbd el-Fattah is one of Egypt\u2019s most prominent political prisoners, having spent most of the past decade behind bars. Last year, shortly after gaining British citizenship through his mother, the democracy activist was sentenced to a further five years in prison for sharing a social media post about torture. He began a hunger strike in April, consuming just 100 calories a day, which he escalated to forgo all sustenance and then even water on the day that Cop27 began in Sharm el-Sheikh.\u201d Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton, tweeted about her sadness that Cop is over, but Alaa has still not been freed.   Updated at 4.46pm GMT    3.51pm    Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at UCL and author of Hothouse Earth: an Inhabitant\u2019s Guide, has written an opinion piece for the Guardian. In it, he eviscerates Cop27 and the UNFCCC process as a whole \u2013 a \u201cbloated travelling circus\u201d, he calls it \u2013 while also offering an alternative:  What is needed is an apparatus that is less cumbersome and more manageable \u2013 something leaner and meaner that zeros in on the most critical aspects of the climate crisis, that does its work largely hidden from the glare of the media, and which presents a less obvious honey pot to the busy bees of the fossil fuel sector. One way forward, then, could be to establish a number of smaller bodies, each addressing one of the key issues \u2013 notably energy, agriculture, deforestation, transport, loss and damage, and perhaps others. Such bodies would operate full-time, liaising with one another and perhaps coming together a few times a year. Ideally, they would be made up of representatives from both developed and majority-world countries. In direct contact with representatives of national governments, part of their remit would be to negotiate agreements that are workable, legally binding, and which actually do the job \u2013 whether reversing deforestation, cutting methane emissions, or drawing down coal usage. As and when all terms and conditions are agreed, these could be validated and signed off by world leaders as a matter of course and without the need for the ballyhoo of a global conference.\u201d  Read his piece in full here:   Updated at 4.47pm GMT    3.05pm    Looking ahead for a moment, next year\u2019s UN climate summit will take place in Dubai in November/December 2023. (And as many commentators are pointing out, given Cop28 will be hosted by an oil state, the United Arab Emirates, it is difficult to imagine much progress on a phase-down of fossil fuels.) Prof Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at the University College London, has shared his take on what the focus needs to be on in the intervening 12 months to achieve some progress:  \u201cThe lessons [of] the multiple failures of Cop27 for Cop28 in Dubai are fourfold: 1. Start the negotiations now and work hard for the next 12 months so that all countries are prepared to get a clear agreement by the end. 2. Run an open and transparent process so all countries understand what is being negotiated and trust can be repaired. 3. Push key countries to increase their ambition and submit improved pledges so there is a chance of sticking to the 1.5C limit with a focus on phasing out fossil fuels. 4. Rich nations including both high-income countries and emerging economies must contribute to adaptation funds and a transparent and an effective loss and damage facility. Climate justice will need to be at the heart of the negotiations for Cop28 as money will need to be put on the table for adaptation, loss and damages and rapid ramp up of renewables.\u201d   Updated at 3.43pm GMT    2.34pm    The UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has made a statement on the outcome of Cop27, saying \u201cthere is no time for complacency\u201d and that \u201cmore must be done\u201d to keep 1.5C alive.  There has been criticism of the UK government\u2019s lack of leadership at Cop, however, and for its continued support of fossil fuel developments in the North Sea. Ed Miliband, shadow climate and net zero secretary for the opposition Labour party \u2013 which has said it would stop granting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea and form an \u201canti-Opec\u201d alliance of countries dedicated to renewable energy \u2013 argued that \u201cthere was a total absence of leadership from the UK PM\u201d. Miliband said Sunak\u2019s \u201cmost memorable act was to decide not to go to Cop27, before he was forced to do so out of embarrassment\u201d.  Harriet Lamb, the CEO of climate solutions charity Ashden, also called out a lack of leadership from the UK:  Throughout the negotiations, Alok Sharma put in a heroic individual effort, but UK leadership was largely absent as the government sidestepped its responsibilities to push for those climate promises made in Glasgow to be turned into measurable funding flows.  Meena Raman, director of Third World Network, said:  Since the EU and Alok Sharma are disappointed that fossil fuel phase-out is not in the text, we would like them to take leadership and revise their NDCs [nationally determined contributions] and put into plans their fossil fuel phase-out urgently and stop expansion of fossil fuels including oil and gas. [It\u2019s] not enough to play to the gallery but act if they really want to save the planet and not hide behind 2050 net zero targets, which will bust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C.\u201d   Updated at 2.37pm GMT    2.12pm    For the US, Cop27 has capped a sort of remarkable turnaround, writes US environment reporter Oliver Milman. Previously a staunch opponent of any sort of compensatory loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries, the US has ended up backing the creation of such a fund, a major triumph of the talks. John Kerry, Joe Biden\u2019s climate envoy who has been isolating after contracting Covid, said the US is \u201cpleased\u201d to support the new fund, after the Americans gained assurances that there would be no legal liability for climate damages suffered by other countries. \u201cThe fund, which will be one among many available avenues for voluntary funding, should be designed to be effective and to attract an expanded donor base,\u201d Kerry said in his closing statement, a nod to other countries the US expects to step up and perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that America has failed to meet previous promises to itself deliver climate finance.Despite the lack of more ambitious language to cut emissions in the Cop27 text, Kerry was upbeat, saying that \u201cmake no mistake: we have kept the hope of 1.5 alive\u201d, in reference to the agreed global temperature rise limit of 1.5C, which scientists now say is a remote possibility.The former Democratic presidential candidate pointedly took aim at China, however, despite a slight thaw between the world\u2019s two largest carbon emitters on climate issues following a diplomatic fallout. The US has wanted China to do more to accelerate emissions cuts and, in particular, commit to slash methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Kerry said:   As I\u2019ve said before, the climate crisis is fundamentally a global, not a bilateral, issue. Reducing emissions in time is about math, not ideology. That\u2019s why all nations have a stake in the choices China makes in this critical decade. The United States and China should be able to accelerate progress together, not only for our sake, but for future generations. And we are all hopeful that China will live up to its global responsibility. As we continue to lead along with our allies and partners in the fight to protect our planet, the United States will also continue to press major emitters like China to significantly enhance their ambition to align with what science says is necessary.\u201d  More broadly, Kerry said that the international community \u201cmust continue pressing for all major economies to align their 2030 targets with 1.5C, and to fulfill those targets by halting the construction of new coal, accelerating the deployment of clean energy, slashing methane emissions, and halting deforestation.\u201d The US came into the Cop27 talks in a bullish mood, following the passage of the inflation reduction act over the summer, which is the first major climate bill ever established by Congress. The American delegation found itself under pressure in Sharm el-Sheikh, however, over the issue of loss and damage, as well as over a glut of new oil and gas projects at home, which Biden has somewhat awkwardly backed in an attempt to lower gasoline prices. Emissions in the US are expected to rise by around 1.5% this year as the economy rebounds and more people start taking flights following Covid-related downturn.  Updated at 2.27pm GMT    1.34pm    More reaction to the deal is coming through, with the initial euphoria over the loss and damage fund giving way to sharp criticism of what was left out \u2013 in particular, the lack of a commitment to phase out fossil fuels, which in turn imperils 1.5C.  The environment director at Human Rights Watch, Richard Pearshouse, argues that despite the breakthrough on loss and damage, Egypt, the petro-states and the fossil fuel industry (who came to Cop27 in larger numbers than ever before) got what they wanted: \u201cthe text makes no mention of phasing out fossil-fuels and weakens reference to the science + the 1.5 degree target\u201d  Jeni Miller, at the Global Climate and Health Alliance of 130 health organisations, makes the link between a healthy planet and healthy people:  Despite support from over 80 countries, governments\u2019 collective failure to deliver a clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels puts us on course to go beyond the already dangerous 1.5C global temperature rise. Only full fossil fuel phase-out will deliver the maximum health benefits from clean air and a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.\u201d  Dr Sven Teske, at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, says:  By agreeing on a [loss and damage] fund without details and the 1.5C target remaining without the commitment to phase-out fossil fuels we technically accept to pay for future damages rather than avoiding them.\u201d  Sir David King, former UK chief scientific adviser and chair of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, says we are still on track for well above 2C:  Even with the commitments made and re-affirmed [at Cop27] the world remains on track for 2.7C. By any measure, that represents a bleak future for humanity. Agreements on loss and damage, like any other support package, are only relevant if they are married with commitments that keep warming well below 1.5oC. One without the other is simply no good.\u201d  Adnan Khan, Pakistan Red Crescent Youth Representative, calls on world leaders to act for the sake of future generations:   \u201cOne third of my country was underwater when floods ravaged Pakistan this year. My friends in other countries are losing their homes to storms, wildfires, and rain. Decisions made at Cop27 - about loss and damage, finance, and early warning systems - they determine my future and the future of young people. We are willing to do our part, but we need leaders to meet us on this path to change.\u201d  I\u2019m Natalie Hanman, head of environment at the Guardian, taking over from Bibi van der Zee, to bring you more reaction to Cop27, and analysis of what it all means. Contact me on natalie.hanman@theguardian.com and @nataliehanman. Thanks for reading     1.08pm   'The 1.5C climate goal died at Cop27 \u2013 but hope must not'  My colleague Damian Carrington has taken a searing look at what Cop27 meant for the goal of keeping global heating below 1.5C, and whether that means it is time to give up.   Does that mean giving up? Absolutely not. The 1.5C target is not a threshold beyond which hope also dies. Every fraction of a degree means an increase in human suffering and must therefore be fought for. How? With everything we have, to tear down the barrier between us and climate stability: the fossil fuel industry.    Instead, the fossil fuel industry and its unconscionable expansion plans will need to be fought elsewhere. The first place is in the mind. The global oil and gas industry has raked in an average equivalent of $1tn a year in unearned profits for the last 50 years by exploiting a natural resource that belongs to citizens. Imagine redirecting that financial firepower at decarbonising the world. The fossil fuel industry can also be fought on the streets, in peaceful protest, and on the lands being despoiled by their expansion. Countries could shun petro-states by forming a \u201cclimate club\u201d, a G7 proposal to enable the ambitious to race ahead and penalise the laggards. A fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty would provide a transparent way to keep remaining coal, oil and gas reserves untouched. Even a tobacco-style ban on fossil fuel advertising, already backed by the World Health Organization, would help. All of this, and more, will be needed. Cop27 did achieve something. The new loss-and-damage fund promises to finance the rebuilding of poorer, vulnerable countries hit by increasingly severe climate impacts, which they have done little to cause. It is a long-overdue acknowledgment of the moral responsibility the big polluters have for the climate emergency. It is all the more important given that Cop27\u2019s failure to meaningfully drive emissions cuts means even worse disasters are to come. Is there hope? Yes, in that every climate action we take lessens the damage. As Cop27 closed, Kathy Jetn\u0304il-Kijiner, poet and climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, said: \u201cI wish we had got fossil fuel phase-out. But we\u2019ve shown with the loss and damage fund that we can do the impossible. So we know we can come back [to Cop] next year and get rid of fossil fuels once and for all.\u201d I hope she is right. I fear she is wrong.      12.51pm   Head of EU describes deal as 'small step towards climate justice'  The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has described the Cop27 deal as \u201ca small step towards climate justice\u201d, but said much more was needed for the planet. In a dramatic U-turn on Friday, the European Union acceded to poor countries\u2019 demands to create a new fund to address the loss and damage caused by global heating, a decision that paved the way for an agreement early on Sunday. Senior EU figures responded cautiously to the outcome of the UN conference. Von der Leyen said much more was needed for the planet: \u201cWe have treated some of the symptoms but not cured the patient from its fever,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI am pleased that Cop27 has opened a new chapter on financing loss and damage, and laid the foundations for a new method for solidarity between those in need and those in a position to help. We are rebuilding trust. \u201cCop27 has kept alive the goal of 1.5C. Unfortunately however, it has not delivered on a commitment by the world\u2019s major emitters to phase down fossil fuels, nor new commitments on climate mitigation.\u201d The leader of the European parliament\u2019s delegation to Sharm el-Sheik, the Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout, was blunter in his criticism. \u201cEurope had to fight to the end to maintain last year\u2019s ambition. But this is insufficient if we want to meet the climate goals. I can therefore only conclude that 2022 has been a lost climate year.\u201d He added that the Cop \u201cachieved something after all\u201d with the decision to create the loss and damage fund.  Updated at 1.34pm GMT    12.36pm    One of the most significant achievements of Cop27, after the new fund for loss and damage, is on how to deliver the trillions of dollars needed to cut carbon emissions and adapt societies to the increasingly severe impacts of climate change. Here\u2019s what the Cop27 decision says, and I\u2019ll explain below: \u201c[The world\u2019s nations] call on the shareholders of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and international financial institutions to reform practices and priorities, align and scale up funding \u2026 and encourage MDBs to define a new vision that [is] fit for the purpose of addressing the global climate emergency.\u201d This is significant because such reforms really could deliver far higher levels of finance. The Cop27 call adds to pressure already coming from developing countries, under the Bridgetown Agenda championed by Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley, and from rich nations, including all of the G7, and recently the G20. They are all demanding fast action, by spring 2023. As Mottley told Cop27, many of the nations at the summit did not even exist when the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other MDBs were set up after the second world war \u2013 they are no longer fit for purpose, she said. The reforms are wide-ranging including, for example, co-investing with the private sector to drastically lower the interest on loans for renewables, a major barrier in developing nations. Another reform is large-scale deployment of \u201cspecial drawing rights\u201d, a type of funds that the IMF creates. Importantly, the Cop27 text calls for MDBs to take into account the high debt burdens many poor nations already have.  Kate Levick, a sustainable finance expert at the thinktank E3G, said: \u201cFinance issues were always going to be critical at this Cop, and sure enough in Egypt they tested the UN process to its limits, with a major gap between the expectations of different groups of countries on provision of climate finance. [But] there was a consensus that current financial architecture and rules are not adequate to meet the climate challenge. The final outcome called for financial system reform, and made a particularly strong set of requests to the MDBs.\u201d You can read more on climate finance here:   Updated at 1.36pm GMT    12.15pm     Fiona Harvey has put together this essential guide to the key outcomes of Cop27. The loss and damage fund is a major milestone, she says, but now comes the difficult part.  There was much tussling over the Glasgow target of focusing on a 1.5C limit. \u201cAt Cop27, some countries tried to renege on the 1.5C goal, and to abolish the ratchet. They failed, but a resolution to cause emissions to peak by 2025 was taken out, to the dismay of many.\u201d Gas also did well out of the Sharm el-Sheikh conference, with a surprisingly large number of deals signed on the sidelines of the summit. Fiona writes: \u201cThe final text of Cop27 contained a provision to boost \u201clow-emissions energy\u201d. That could mean many things, from wind and solar farms to nuclear reactors, and coal-fired power stations fitted with carbon capture and storage. It could also be interpreted to mean gas, which has lower emissions than coal, but is still a major fossil fuel.\u201d There was no improvement on last year\u2019s commitment to phase down the use of coal, despite intensive lobbying from many groups who wanted to get a commitment to \u2018phase down all fossil fuels\u2019 into the text. But there was arguably some headway on reform of the global financial system, with a growing number of countries looking for urgent changes to the world\u2019s multilateral banks which, they argue, are failing to provide the necessary funding. This is now a serious topic of discussion.  Updated at 1.37pm GMT    11.47am   Who were the standout voices of Cop27?  Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, made her mark at Cop26 in Glasgow, where she was a powerful voice for developing countries. In Egypt, too, she has again been a force to be reckoned with.  Sherry Rehman, the Pakistani climate minister, also played a vital part with her team of negotiators. Our reporter Nina Lakhani pointed out: \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting the key role played by Pakistan in securing the historic agreement in creating a loss and damage facility. This year, Pakistan holds the presidency of the G77 negotiating bloc of developing countries plus China, and its negotiators came to Sharm el-Sheikh determined to secure the new funding mechanism after a catastrophic climate year.\u201d Rehman fought like a tiger for the loss and damage fund, and was justly overjoyed that it got through.  And the Tuvalu finance minister, Seve Paeniu, gave an impactful speech, holding up a picture of his grandchildren, at a key moment. The island of Tuvalu in the Pacific region is fighting for its life in a way that other countries are not and he humblingly reminded other delegates of this fact.  There were so many campaigners working hard to keep delegates focused on the global issues rather than just on their national responsibilities, such as the tireless Meena Raman, director of Third World Network, Harjeet Singh of the Climate Action Network and Mohamed Adow of Power Shift Africa. But most of all, as in every year, it was the youth activists who held everyone\u2019s feet to the fire, reminding delegates simply through their presence that they will take the brunt of any decisions made, or unmade at this Cop. Vanessa Nakate increasingly occupies a leadership position within the youth movement, but there is a whole new cohort of activists who are taking up the heavy responsibility of speaking truth to power, including Licypriya Kangujam and Mitzi Jonelle Tan.  And of course Nakeeyat Sam Dramani, the young poet from Ghana (just 10 years old), who implored delegates to \u2018have a heart\u2019.   Updated at 1.54pm GMT    11.26am    This will also be the first text which has included \u2018tipping points\u2019, notes Leo Hickman.  This follows a major study in September that showed that climate crisis has driven the world to the brink of multiple \u201cdisastrous\u201d tipping points, as reported by my colleague Damian Carrington at the time. The report found that five dangerous tipping points may already have been passed due to the 1.1C of global heating caused by humanity to date. These include the collapse of Greenland\u2019s ice cap, eventually producing a huge sea level rise, the collapse of a key current in the north Atlantic, disrupting rain upon which billions of people depend for food, and an abrupt melting of carbon-rich permafrost.  At 1.5C of heating, the minimum rise now expected, four of the five tipping points move from being possible to likely, the analysis said. Also at 1.5C, an additional five tipping points become possible, including changes to vast northern forests and the loss of almost all mountain glaciers. In total, the researchers found evidence for 16 tipping points, with the final six requiring global heating of at least 2C to be triggered, according to the scientists\u2019 estimations. The tipping points would take effect on timescales varying from a few years to centuries.    Updated at 11.41am GMT    11.02am    The co-leader of the UK\u2019s Green party Adrian Ramsay is pointing out that while the establishment of the loss and damage fund is an important fund, \u201cthe fund is currently empty and we now need rich countries like the UK to step up, honour their commitment to this fund and pay for the harm they have inflicted through historical emissions\u201d. \u201cBut the real failure at Sharm el-Sheikh was that no significant progress has been made in commitments on fossil fuels, which is unsurprising given the hundreds of fossil fuel lobbyists who were active inside the negotiation. In terms of the commitment to eliminating fossil fuels from the global economy, Cop27 represents a backward step.\u201d  Updated at 11.12am GMT    10.34am     The reactions from climate justice organisations have been tempered by disappointment, too. Lidy Nacpil, Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development, says: \u201cWe welcome an initial partial win on Loss &amp; Damage Fund \u2013 it is there but buried with other \u2018financial arrangements.\u2019 And this win is overshadowed by lack of progress on fossil fuel phase-out and the continued inclusion of false solutions, which means more loss and damage! Lack of progress on fossil fuel phase-out shows the hypocrisy of governments of rich countries in their blah blah blah about keeping global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees, and the corporate capture of the Cop by the fossil fuel industries. We need to escalate even more our struggles \u2013 in our countries and international arenas! Onwards!\u201d Asad Rehman, of War on Want, who has been such a powerful voice in the movement, said: \u201cWe leave the summit with a glimmer of hope that the establishment of a Loss and Damage Fund will provide much needed support to those on the frontlines of the climate catastrophe. It\u2019s a small step, a critical one, but an empty fund means nothing. Rich countries who continue to pollute must now provide real finance to the fund.  \u201cThis historic victory was only made possible because of people power. The unprecedented pressure by climate justice groups and the refusal of developing countries to be bullied or divided, dragged rich countries kicking and screaming across the line.\u201d But, he cautioned, people were also \u201cbitter at the refusal of the rich to cut their emissions, and shift away from their addiction to fossil fuels. This continues to be a life and death fight for the future of humanity. But the growing power of climate justice movements is sending a warning to rich countries that we are not, and never will be defeated.\u201d  Updated at 10.53am GMT    10.07am    Avinash Persaud, special climate envoy to PM Mia Mottley of Barbados, sees this as a \u201csmall victory for humankind\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been agreed. I can now say and be quoted: we have a historic decision to establish a loss and damage fund for countries acutely impacted by the warming climate. It was the result of the strong leadership by the alliance of small Island states with an amazing degree of solidarity shown by the rest of the world, from the major industrialising developing countries and the developed ones. It is a small victory for humankind. Now we need to redouble efforts behind an energy, transport and agriculture transition that will limit these climate losses and damages in the future.\u201d And Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, climate envoy from the Marshall Islands, said: \u201cI\u2019m proud I got to be here to witness this happen and contribute in a small way. Worn out but so worth it to protect already disappearing islets, shorelines and culture. So many people all this week told us we wouldn\u2019t get it. So glad they were wrong. \u201cI wish we got fossil fuel phase-out. The current text is not enough. But we\u2019ve shown with the loss and damage fund that we can do the impossible. So we know we can come back next year and get rid of fossil fuels once and for all.\u201d More reaction from some of the key players here:   Updated at 10.13am GMT    9.55am   International media response so far has been mixed  It\u2019s fair to say that so far the reaction to the cover text produced at Cop27 is mixed. While most celebrate the wins \u2013 in particular the establishment of a loss and damage fund \u2013 there is a sense that the final deal was a missed opportunity, and that time is running out. The Washington Post in the US notes the significance of the creation of the loss and damage fund, in particular for the US. \u201cNegotiators reached a deal on a \u201closs and damage fund\u201d that represented a significant shift for US leaders, who have long feared such payments could make the nation liable for huge sums, given its historical contribution to emissions. But the Biden administration could no longer resist in the face of possible global condemnation at this year\u2019s UN. climate change conference, known as Cop27.\u201d The Wire in India reports: \u201cCountries adopted a hard-fought final agreement at the Cop27 climate summit early on Sunday that sets up a fund to help poor countries being battered by climate disasters \u2013 but does not boost efforts to tackle the emissions causing them. The session first swiftly approved the text\u2019s provision to set up a \u2018loss and damage\u2019 fund to help developing countries bear the immediate costs of climate-fuelled events such as storms and floods.  \u201cBut it kicked many of the most controversial decisions on the fund into next year, when a \u201ctransitional committee\u201d would make recommendations for countries to then adopt at the Cop28 climate summit in November 2023. Those recommendations would cover \u201cidentifying and expanding sources of funding\u201d \u2013 referring to the vexed question of which countries should pay into the new fund.\u201d El Pais in Spain reports the lack of ambition on 1.5C which has troubled many observers, referencing that many had hoped to get large carbon emitters like China, the \u201cworld\u2019s leading emitter\u201d to increase their reduction commitments. According to El Pais, this was what particularly held up the summit \u2013 the EU was not able to get its demands for more ambition through in the end.  Updated at 10.15am GMT    9.14am    More reaction coming in. Ruth Townend, research fellow on the environment and society programme at Chatham House, got straight to the point. She said: \u201cWorld governments have, at most, three years to bend the curve on emissions, and nothing short of transformational change to energy, transport and food systems, the global financial architecture and the way individuals live their lives, can achieve this. \u201cIn Sharm-el-Sheikh, precious time and opportunity was squandered. Governments can still head the signals of change coming out of Cop27 through ambitious national action in the year ahead, coming into Cop28 next year prepared to take transformative multilateral action where it matters. The future of the world\u2019s citizens, you, me, our children and grandchildren, rests firmly on their shoulders.\u201d Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF, said: \u201cWhile a deal on loss and damage finance is a positive step, it risks becoming a down payment on disaster unless emissions are urgently cut in line with the 1.5C goal. By refusing to phase out fossil fuels, governments have failed to reach a more ambitious agreement than in Glasgow last year and put our health and security at risk. \u201cAs attention turns to the Cop15 biodiversity summit in Montreal next month, the UK government must lead from the front in securing a gamechanging global deal to reverse the loss of nature by 2030 and bring our world back to life.\u201d  Updated at 9.37am GMT    8.59am   'Nature-based solutions' included in the cover decision for first time  Leo Hickman, of Carbon Brief, has pointed out that for the first time ever, a Cop decision includes \u201cnature-based solution\u201d and a dedicated section on forests. This is of course excellent news.  He has also spotted \u201cfood\u201d in there and believes this is the first time, too.  The wording is quite opaque, however, and does not openly acknowledge the role that farming systems play in producing carbon emissions. The text acknowledges that \u201cthe impacts of climate change exacerbate the global energy and food crises, and vice-versa\u201d. It talks about food security, and \u201cthe particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change\u201d.  Updated at 9.37am GMT    8.37am    The only way to survive an all-nighter at Cop27 \u2013 the power nap. With the closing plenary only starting in the middle of the night, here is a brief photographic guide to the tactics adopted by some delegates in order to make it to dawn.     Updated at 8.43am GMT    8.18am   Criticism of the Egyptian management is surfacing  Throughout the conference there has been criticism of the way it was being managed by the Egyptian presidency. At some points it looked as if they were moving far too slowly and the last couple of days they were reported to be following procedures that were far from transparent, which meant it was difficult for delegates to be sure that everyone was having the same conversation. Joe Lo of Climate Home is reporting that Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, issued a statement accusing the presidency of \u201cstonewalling and organisational shortcoming\u201d, and said that only a progressive trans-continental alliance prevented \u201cutter failure\u201d.  They might argue, however, that they were balancing some very conflicting demands. Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister and president of the summit, says: \u201cIn the end we delivered. We listened to the calls of anguish and despair.\u201d  Updated at 8.37am GMT    7.56am    Friends of the Earth International gave a qualified welcome to the news. Sara Shaw said: \u201cIt is a relief that the Loss and Damage fund has finally been established, after decades of struggle. But, right now, it is an empty fund, and we have a huge challenge ahead to ensure that developed countries contribute to it, in line with justice and equity. We must not see a repeat of the abysmal performance of rich countries failing to provide the already inadequate $100bn a year promised over a decade ago.\u201d Babawale Obayanju, of Friends of the Earth Africa, added: \u201cThe fact that the outcome only talks about \u2018phasedown of unabated coal power\u2019 is a disaster for Africa and for the climate. Oil and gas must be also be phased out, swiftly and fairly. One small word, \u2018unabated\u2019, creates a huge loophole, opening the door to new fossil-based hydrogen and carbon capture and storage projects, which will allow emissions to continue. We don\u2019t need more gas extraction in Africa, devastating our communities for the benefit of rich countries and corporations. What we needed from Cop27 was agreement to a rapid, equitable phase out of all fossil fuels.\u201d  Hemantha Withanage, chair of Friends of the Earth International, said from Sri Lanka: \u201cThe decision on carbon markets is deeply worrying. Whilst Cop27 has temporarily delayed moves to put geoengineering, dangerous and untested technologies, and so-called nature-based solutions into carbon offset markets, we know these threats will rear their heads again. Carbon markets give cover for continued emissions by polluters, grabbing of land, forests and water from vulnerable communities, and violations of people\u2019s rights.\u201d The Global Climate and Health Alliance \u2013 a global network of health professionals and NGOs \u2013 has also welcomed the decision to establish a loss and damage fund, but are frustrated by the stalled progress on fossil fuel phase-out.  Updated at 8.10am GMT    7.36am    Our heroic Fiona Harvey has just tweeted some pictures from the closing phases of the plenary.     I\u2019m Bibi van der Zee, and I\u2019m just taking over from Alan Evans on the blog now, by the way.      7.21am    Shoukry closes the conference by thanking the support staff at the venue, to a round of applause from the smattering of delegates still in the room. There are a lot of hugs, handshakes and smiles among the UN representatives and the live stream is cut off.     7.06am    The delegate from Barbados, one of the most outspoken countries in the process through its president, Mia Mottley, has spoken:  \u201cWhen we came here there was a great philosophical chasm on how we\u2019d approach these issues, particularly on loss and damage. Thanks to the countries who took the leap, it\u2019s a significant move forward. \u201cThere have been complaints that the text is not perfect and indeed it is not \u2026 but we have all moved forward, must not allow the search for perfection stop us from doing what is possible and pragmatic. We are grateful to see so many elements of the Bridgetown initiative included, and we look forward to the reform of the multilateral development banks. \u201cWe have to concede that action and ambition have lagged behind our advocacy, the time has come to make sure they catch up. We must recognise this historic moment in this historic country when we took a big step for climate justice. \u201cWe have a compromise that gives satisfaction but not joy. We now have to keep working to get to the point that we can sing joyfully that we are doing what we must and what the people of the world expect of us.\u201d  You can read more about the Bridgetown Agenda referred to here:  With that, it appears we are at the end of the countries who wish to speak, and Shoukry moves on to observer organisations.     6.52am    Mohamed Adow, who runs the Power Shift Africa thinktank, is broadly pleased with the outcome:  \u201cTo quote the Three Lions England football song, after 30 years of hurt, climate action is finally coming home on African soil here in Egypt.\u201d  \u201cAt the beginning of these talks loss and damage was not even on the agenda and now we are making history. It just shows that this UN process can achieve results, and that the world can recognise the plight of the vulnerable must not be treated as a political football. It\u2019s worth noting that we have the fund but we need money to make it worthwhile. What we have is an empty bucket. Now we need to fill it so that support can flow to the most impacted people who are suffering right now at the hands of the climate crisis. \u201cHowever, on a global fossil fuel phase down it\u2019s sad to see countries just copying and pasting the outcome from last year\u2019s Cop26 in Glasgow. The science is clear, the impacts are getting worse and we know that renewables are the future. Polluting countries need to leave coal, oil and gas in the ground if we\u2019re going to keep global heating from running out of control.\u201d      6.45am    The youth delegate from Norway has some strong words: \u201cI am disappointed, sad and angry. Where is the urgency? Where is the crisis management? \u201cThis is not about politics, this is about humanity. These times require us to put our values and morals in the driver\u2019s seat. We need you to be brave, to do absolutely everything in your power. If you don\u2019t act now, it might be too late for us to right your wrongs when we inherit your seats. \u201cThe alternative to radically upscaling ambition now will create a world none of us want to live in. Now is the time to decide if you want to be tomorrow\u2019s villains or heroes.\u201d     6.30am   Alok Sharma: Peaking of greenhouse gas emission in 2025 \"not in this text\"  The UK\u2019s lead climate negotiator, the minister Alok Sharma, has just delivered a telling speech at Cop27 revealing what some countries had tried to push through to an agreement. Sharma was the president of the Glasgow Cop in 2021, and he was clearly frustrated with the events of the last two weeks in Egypt. He punctuated his speech with his hand thudding in to his speech notes.  We joined with many parties to propose a number of measures that would have contributed to [raising ambition]. Emissions peaking before 2025 as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text. Clear commitments to phase put all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text weakened in the final minutes. Friends, I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak. Unfortunately it remains on life support. All of us need to look ourselves in the mirror and consider if we have fully risen to the challenge.  Sharma said he would not be in the UK\u2019s chair position at next year\u2019s Cop meeting, but added:  I promise you if we do not step up soon and rise above the minute to midnight battles to hold the line we will all be found wanting. Each of us will have to explain that to our citizens to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries and communities and ultimately to the children and grandchildren to whom many of us now go home.   Updated at 6.36am GMT    6.22am    Here are some early reactions from big names to the outcome of Cop27: Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the landmark Paris agreement  \u201cThis Cop caused deep frustrations but it wasn\u2019t for nothing. It achieved a significant breakthrough for the most vulnerable countries. The loss and damage fund, a dream at Cop26 last year, is on track to start running in 2023. There is a lot of work still to be done on the detail, but the principle is in place and that is a significant mindset shift as we deal with a world in which climate impacts cause profound loss.  \u201cThe influence of the fossil-fuel industry was found across the board. This Cop has weakened requirements around countries making new and more ambitious commitments. The text makes no mention of phasing out fossil-fuels and scant reference to science and the 1.5C target. The Egyptian presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petrostates and the fossil-fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.\u201d \u201cElsewhere in Sharm el-Sheikh, it was a silent and fearful Cop for many activists. The legacy of those fighting for civic space and human rights will endure.\u201d  Mary Robinson, chair of The Elders group of statespeople  \u201cIn a year of multiple crises and climate shocks, the historic outcome on loss and damage at Cop27 shows international cooperation is possible, even in these testing times. Equally, the renewed commitment on the 1.5 global warming limit was a source of relief.  \u201cHowever, none of this changes the fact that the world remains on the brink of climate catastrophe. Progress made on mitigation since Cop26 in Glasgow has been too slow. Climate action at Cop27 shows we are on the cusp of a clean energy world, but only if G20 leaders live up to their responsibilities, keep their word, and strengthen their will. The onus is on them. All climate commitments must be transformed into real-world action, including the rapid phase out of fossil fuels, a much faster transition towards green energy, and tangible plans for delivering both adaptation and loss and damage finance.  \u201cWe avoided backsliding and made progress in Sharm el-Sheikh. Now leaders must stop sidestepping and fulfil their promises to safeguard a liveable future.\u201d  Vanessa Nakate, a climate justice activist from Uganda  \u201cCop27 was meant to be the \u2018African Cop\u2019 but the needs of African people have been obstructed throughout. Loss and damage in vulnerable countries is now unignorable, but some developed countries here in Egypt have decided to ignore our suffering. Young people were not able to have their voice heard at Cop27 because of restrictions on protest, but our movement is growing and ordinary citizens in every country are starting to hold their governments accountable on the climate crisis at home  I\u2019m Alan Evans, picking up the blog again, and you can reach me at alan.evans@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @itsalanevans.     5.57am   Group of members \u2018deeply disappointed\u2019 and call for \u2018urgent escalation\u2019  It is 8am in Sharm El-sheikh and the closing plenary is still going, with final statements being made by parties and observers. Some of the elation at Cop27\u2019s historic deal on loss and damage is giving way to the realisation the conference didn\u2019t deliver on the fundamental challenge of agreeing more rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. Australian climate negotiator, Sally Box, has just made a statement on behalf of members of the Umbrella group \u2013 a negotiating bloc that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, the UK and the United States. The loss and damage deal was historic, she said, but:  We must go further in light of the stark findings of the latest science including by recognising that global emissions must peak by 2025 to keep 1.5C alive.  In a speech to the plenary, She asked all countries to come up with an \u201curgent escalation of our efforts\u201d.  Parties, we must turn resolve into action. We are deeply disappointed that some parties have sought to restrain the ambition of this work [climate mitigation] work program. We cannot decide to do less.  Note: an earlier version of this post said Australia\u2019s Kristen Tilley had delivered the statement. Apologies for that error.  Updated at 6.26am GMT    5.36am   EU climate policy chief: \u2018We have all fallen short\u2019  The European Union\u2019s climate policy chief Frans Timmermans has just delivered an impassioned plea to the floor of the closing plenary at Cop27 in Egypt. Timmermans said sacrifices had been made in order to get the agreement for loss and damage over the line, but he left the room in no doubt of his disappointment.  Friends are not friends if they only tell you what you want to hear. Last night our talks have stalled. There were too many attempts to roll back even on what we agreed in Glasgow.  Timmermans asked all countries to do more.  The fight for ambition for a better future is not yet over. In fact it\u2019s only just begun. We know the cost of inaction is so much higher than the cost of action. We should have done much more. We have all fallen short in actions to avoid loss and damage. Our citizens expect us to lead. That means far more rapidly reduced emissions.   Updated at 6.07am GMT    5.10am   UN secretary general: 'Our planet is still in the emergency room'  The UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has released a full statement on the outcomes of Cop27.  He\u2019s already described the creation of a loss and damage fund for developing countries as an important step for climate justice.  He said financial institutions and multinational banks needed to \u201caccept more risk and systematically leverage private finance for developing countries at reasonable costs.\u201d   But let\u2019s be clear.  Our planet is still in the emergency room.  We need to drastically reduce emissions now \u2013 and this is an issue this COP did not address.  A fund for loss and damage is essential \u2013 but it\u2019s not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map \u2013 or turns an entire African country to desert.  The world still needs a giant leap on climate ambition.  The red line we must not cross is the line that takes our planet over the 1.5 degree temperature limit.    Updated at 5.57am GMT    4.39am   Progress on loss and damage comes despite stalled climate ambitions  While there has been a landmark breakthrough on loss and damage, the other outcomes of Cop27 look disappointingly similar to last year\u2019s climate summit in Scotland. Last year, for the first time, a fossil fuel \u2013 namely coal \u2013 was mentioned for \u201cphase down\u201d in a UN climate agreement and several countries, and climate campaigners, had pushed for all fossil fuels, including oil and gas, to be named for elimination at Cop27. But this did not happen, nor did any stronger language around achieving the in-peril target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This has led to frustration among some countries.  Espen Barth Eide, Norway\u2019s environment minister, said   We were suggesting we should have a phaseout of unabated fossil fuels, of course this is not in, I would prefer it to be in. It\u2019s not as strong as we\u2019d like it to be, but it doesn\u2019t raise ambition further and that\u2019s something we have to work on further at Cop28.  Even worse to some was the inclusion in the agreement text of \u201clow-emission\u201d as well as renewable energy, a wording that could be interpreted as an endorsement of gas, which is seen as a cleaner fossil fuel than coal and yet still comes with substantial planet-heating emissions. Collin Rees, campaign manager at Oil Change International, said:   Cop27\u2019s key steps toward a loss and damage fund are deeply marred by the lack of progress on fossil fuels. Despite unprecedented discussion of equitably phasing out oil, gas, and coal, the end result was yet another Cop without formal recognition that Big Oil is driving the climate crisis and harming communities.  Climate scientists have warned that there currently is no credible path to staying below 1.5C given countries\u2019 insufficient emissions reduction targets, with 2022 on track to set a new record for global greenhouse gas emissions.  Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the emissions trajectory is \u201cdangerously off course\u201d and the agreement does little to alter this.  Though it makes some important advances, the final Cop27 decision falls well short of what the science shows is needed.      4.36am    We are still in the final throes of the closing plenary. The Cop 27 president has been rapidly reading out the titles of documents \u2013 some of which have new revisions \u2013 and opening and closing the meetings of the different work streams. Some proposals that have come before the Cop have gone unresolved and so have been been referred back to the next meeting, It is 6.45am in Sharm El-Sheikh and some officials on the main stage are struggling to keep their eyes open.   Updated at 4.41am GMT    4.27am    A historic deal to set up a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund to pay poorer countries harmed by the impacts of the climate crisis has been agreed to at a UN summit, capping a decades-long fight by climate campaigners and developing nations. The decision marked a breakthrough at the climate negotiations, where for years developing countries have pressed wealthier nations to provide a form of compensation for the droughts, wildfires, floods and other escalating climate impacts they\u2019ve faced due to the planet-heating emissions that have mostly come from the richest corners of the world. Read our full story below.      4.21am    When the dust settles on Cop27, the new carbon market rules \u2013 article 6 of the Paris agreement \u2013 will likely be one of the most controversial and far reaching deals of the summit.  Critics say it lacks transparency, allows questionable accounting practices, backtracks on human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples, and locks in loopholes for polluting industries and countries to greenwash and delay greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  Rachel Rose Jackson from Corporate Accountability said:   These outcomes are only worthy of celebration if you are either a carbon marketeer about to profit immensely, or the Global North governments who are locking in their ability to recklessly use offsets and removals - without required human rights and other safeguards - to ignore their obligation to actually reduce emissions. This is not reflective of keeping 1.5 alive.      4.17am    The UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has also welcomed an \u201cimportant step towards justice\u201d on climate change.      4.14am   Small island states: 'A mission thirty years in the making'  The Alliance of Small Island States, a negotiating bloc including some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries, has celebrated the establishment of a loss and damage response fund as \u201ca mission thirty years in the making\u201d. The Aosis chair, Molwyn Joseph:   We have literally exhausted all of our efforts here at Cop27 to bring home the climate action commitments our vulnerable people desperately need. Our ministers and negotiators have endured sleepless nights and endless days in an intense series of negotiations, determined to secure the establishment of a loss and damage response fund, keep 1.5C alive, and advance ambition on critical mitigation and adaptation plans. But after the pain comes the progress. Today, the international community has restored global faith in this critical process that is dedicated to ensuring no one is left behind. The agreements made at Cop27 are a win for our entire world. We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve. Now we must solidify our ties across territories. We must work even harder to hold firm to the 1.5C warming limit, to operationalize the loss and damage fund, and continue to create a world that is safe, fair, and equitable for all.   Updated at 8.17am GMT    4.07am    It\u2019s worth noting the key role played by Pakistan in securing the historic agreement in creating a loss and damage facility.  This year Pakistan holds the presidency of the G77 negotiating bloc of developing countries plus China, and its negotiators came to Sharm el-Sheikh determined to secure the new funding mechanism after a catastrophic climate year.  A summer of drought and record breaking temperatures was followed by unprecedented rains and floods that left a third of the country under water, causing $30bn of damage and economic losses. Here is a thread on the achievement from Pakistani climate minister Sherry Rehman, who described the victory as an important first step for climate justice.       3.51am    Still more decisions going through as night turns into day in Sharm El-Sheikh.  Some documents agreed have been subject to last minute revisions. It often takes hours and days to get a full understanding of what\u2019s agreed in these moments.     3.46am    Teresa Anderson, Global Lead on Climate Justice, at ActionAid, reflects on a \u201cpinch me moment\u201d at Cop27.  After so many years of calling for the UN to agree to establish a fund to help countries being pushed deeper into poverty, this is a real pinch-me moment. We can give credit to the collective pressure from civil society, combined with unprecedented unity among developing countries, for forcing rich countries to finally say \u201cYes - we are in this together\u201d.  Mohamed Adow, Executive Director of the think tank Power Shift Africa, said:  COP27 has done what no other COP has achieved and created a loss and damage fund to support the most impacted communities of climate change.  At the beginning of these talks loss and damage was not even on the agenda and now we are making history. It just shows that this UN process can achieve results, and that the world can recognise the plight of the vulnerable must not be treated as a political football.   Updated at 3.47am GMT    3.43am    The president of the Cop, Sameh Shoukry, is now moving through more revised documents and gavelling them through.  There\u2019s very tired applause. It\u2019s is 5.45am there after all.     3.39am    We\u2019re still getting reactions to the historic creation of a loss and damage fund. Harjeet Singh, Head of Global Political Strategy at Climate Action Network International, a network of 190 civil society groups in 130 countries, said:  With the creation of a new Loss and Damage Fund, COP27 has sent a warning shot to polluters that they can no longer go scot-free with their climate destruction. From now on, they will have to pay up for the damages they cause and are accountable to the people who are facing supercharged storms, devastating floods and rising seas.Countries must now work together to ensure that the new fund can become fully operational and respond to the most vulnerable people and communities who are facing the brunt of climate crisis.   Updated at 3.40am GMT    3.37am    And we\u2019re on another pause now in Sharm El-Sheikh after another couple of minutes of the plenary coming into session. Two further documents were agreed. We\u2019ll get across anything noteworthy in amongst that.     3.22am    The plenary is now restarting.     3.21am    Here\u2019s the words from the document agreed at Cop27 that establishes a fund to help developing countries cope with the impacts of climate change. This is UN climate convention language, but it is significant.  The Conference of the Parties and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, Recalling the Convention and the Paris Agreement\u2026 Decide to establish new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, in responding to loss and damage, including with a focus on addressing loss and damage by providing and assisting in mobilizing new and additional resources, and that these new arrangements complement and include sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement; Also decide, in the context of establishing the new funding arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 above, to establish a fund for responding to loss and damage whose mandate includes a focus on addressing loss and damage;  The document, agreed by almost 200 countries, also establishes a committee to come up with rules to make the fund happen. That committee will report back at next year\u2019s Cop.     3.07am    Here\u2019s the president of Cop27, Sameh Shoukry, after he just confirmed at the final plenary that a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund would be created.  We are still waiting for the plenary to restart. The 30 minute delay has become almost an hour.      2.51am   Cop27 agrees a 'loss and damage' fund for poorer countries  We are starting to get reactions now for what was agreed in the last hour, and the news about the passing of a loss and damage fund is being celebrated. To be clear, campaigners for poorer nations have been pushing for a funding facility that would help them pay for the impacts of climate change for years.  Just getting this onto the Cop27 agenda was seen as a victory, so to have a scheme agreed is a huge step. Nabeel Munir, Pakistani diplomat and chief negotiator for the G77 told the Guardian:   It\u2019s a historic moment. Culmination of 30 years of work and beginning of a new chapter in pursuit of climate justice. A ray of hope for countries most affected by climate induced close and damage.    Updated at 8.17am GMT    2.46am    We are still in this \u201c30 minute\u201d suspension of the main plenary at Cop27. But here\u2019s what we gather is happening now. Each Cop ends with a final overall text and this draft appeared to have been released by the Cop27 president within minutes of the final plenary meeting starting. So Switzerland stood up and asked for more time. In this current draft text, the temperature goals look as though they are in line with what was agreed in Glasgow in 2021, when a phase down for coal was also agreed. There were hopes amongst some that the Egypt Cop would broaden this \u201cphase down\u201d to include all fossil fuels, but there is no such language in this text being negotiated. Here\u2019s what it does say:  Calls upon Parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards a just transition;      2.23am    Some draft texts have been agreed and gavelled through moments ago by the Cop president that relate to what has been a major sticking point in these talks.  That is, the creation of a funding facility for developing countries to draw on to pay for the \u201closs and damage\u201d caused by climate change. We\u2019ll try and get some detail now on what was in the final text and what was agreed. Moments later, after an intervention from Switzerland, the plenary has now been suspended for another 30 minutes.     2.13am   Final plenary begins  The final plenary has started. Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry is speaking now. He opened the meeting with an apology for any missteps. You can watch the final plenary at this link.  Updated at 2.34am GMT    1.57am    Good morning, afternoon, evening or goodmiddleofthenight if you\u2019re in Egypt\u2019s Sharm el-Sheikh International Convention Centre for the final hours of Cop27.  I\u2019m Graham Readfearn taking hold of our live blog for a while. The main plenary room where we hope to see some final texts agreed is starting to fill up. A 3.30am scheduled start time has flown by.       1.40am    For those counting, we\u2019re now up to the third longest Cop ever. The next time to watch is 6.22am, when it would pass Cop17 in Durban for second place. Some delegates are trickling into the plenary room but it still looks fairly empty, so even though it\u2019s still listed as starting 10 minutes ago it is likely to be a little while yet.      1.18am    It appears the plenary has been postponed again, now to 3.30am (1.30am GMT), according to the Cop27 official schedule.  The Earth Negotiations Bulletin NGO has heard it may be even later at 4am, which at this stage would not be much of a surprise. The YouTube channel is still saying 3am, but not showing anything.      1.08am    The start time for the 3am final plenary delegates had been told to wait for has come and gone. One delegate has tweeted that there is a crowd waiting outside the main plenary room but, for now, they\u2019re not being allowed in. Waiting. Waiting.  The plenary will be streamed on this YouTube page, if you also enjoy waiting for things.  Updated at 1.08am GMT    1.00am    The term \u201cdeveloping countries that are particularly vulnerable\u201d, which appears in the latest public version of the loss and damage document, is a phrase that has been used before by the Green Climate Fund, established by the UNFCCC.  It defines these as: \u201cincluding least developed countries, small island developing states and African states\u201d. It does not exclude any countries, and so may be deemed more acceptable language by richer G77 countries. Of course, we still haven\u2019t seen any final documents so it\u2019s all just speculation at this stage.     12.44am    \u201cSome hardy delegates took the chance to get some sleep and are now heading back to the Sharm el-Sheikh International Convention Centre for what they hope will be the final and closing plenary meeting of this drawn-out Egyptian Cop.    Final hours of Cop meetings often feature officials and delegates in various states of sleep deprivation and it appears this one is no different.       12.19am    Aruna Chandrasekhar from Carbon Brief has pointed out that the latest version of a text on loss and damage has changed the wording on vulnerable developing countries, something that has reportedly been one of the major causes of delay.  The new text says \u201cdeveloping countries that are particularly vulnerable\u201d instead of \u201cdeveloping countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable.\u201d This language would seem to narrow the range of countries the phrase describes slightly, and it\u2019s on ostensibly minor details such as these that Cop agreements can stand or fall.  Updated at 12.22am GMT    12.06am    The Associated Press have an update from Ireland\u2019s environment minister, Eamon Ryan, who said they had not yet seen an overarching draft of the final document. Here\u2019s their report:  I think everybody\u2019s very unhappy that we\u2019re here, one in the morning, we\u2019re still waiting for the cover text,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI think that\u2019s very unusual, to say the least.\u201d Ryan said he wanted to see more \u201cambition\u201d on emissions cuts that would build on pledges made last year to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied that there\u2019s been sufficient ambition on reducing emissions, and we\u2019re going to have to see what further improvements we can get here, but also come back to it.\u201d   Updated at 12.10am GMT    11.35pm    Another hour has just been added to the YouTube counter with the plenary now scheduled for 3am local time (1am GMT). We\u2019ve heard rumours from one delegation that they\u2019ve been told the plenary will be from 3am to 6am, so we could be in for a very long night. But the fact they\u2019re persevering an hour at a time rather than postponing until the morning suggests Egypt must think they can reach a resolution tonight. I\u2019m Alan Evans, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be picking this blog back up again after kicking it off more than 15 hours ago. Anyway, you can reach me at alan.evans@theguardian.com, or on Twitter at @itsalanevans if you have any tips, gossip, or life advice.  Updated at 12.10am GMT    11.22pm    Robin McKie, science and environment editor for the Observer, has written about five key issues in the fight to save planet \u2013 1.5C, loss and damage, nature, fossil fuels and adaptation \u2013 and what, if anything, Cop27 did about them. He also reminds us that there\u2019s no rest for environmentalists, with another Cop coming up in a matter of weeks, this one focusing on biodiversity:  Threats [to nature] will be debated intensively at Cop15, the UN biodiversity summit next month. However, no mention of the conference has been made in Egypt despite the strong link between climate change and species loss.\u201d       10.54pm    It\u2019s still a messy picture out there, but this is the latest we are hearing:  The plenary is now expected at around 2am or 3am local time. There\u2019s cautious optimism on loss and damage, with various sources saying they are confident the facility is in. Reports of negotiations on loss and damage being reopened were, the Guardian has been told, down to a clerical issue (possibly a typo in the text), which has now been resolved. There are two issues being focused on now, the Guardian understands: the cover decision, and the language around phasing out fossil fuels. On the latter, there is less optimism. Cop27 has now become the fourth longest Cop ever \u2026 and still counting.  I\u2019m Natalie Hanman (natalie.hanman@theguardian.com or @nataliehanman), taking over from Bibi van der Zee.  Updated at 11.20pm GMT    10.12pm   Further delay to the closing plenary  Nope. Another hour has been added on to the YouTube ticker. As a colleague said earlier, it\u2019s the hope that kills you.  Meanwhile, it looks as if a brief flurry of concern over the loss and damage fund may have calmed down now. Some campaigners were flagging that, at the last minute (although, as we know, there may be many more minutes to come), it looked as if the text was being picked apart, with developing countries walking back on the agreements they had made earlier. But both Fiona Harvey and Nina Lakhani have been digging in to find out what\u2019s happening and it looks as if the snarl was around procedural issues. The fund is still alive and kicking.  Updated at 10.15pm GMT    10.02pm    In theory the closing plenary should be starting now. In practice \u2026      9.33pm    In the US, meanwhile, they\u2019re seeing the results of the major lake-effect snow event which has hit the Great Lakes region, with projected snowfalls of between 4-6 feet over a few days in some areas.  According to our Weather Tracker column: \u201cLake-effect snow occurs when cold air blows across an unfrozen lake that is relatively warm, heating the cold air from below and creating heavy snow showers. These showers often form in narrow quasi-stationary bands, causing significant amounts of snow to fall over a small area. This current event is caused by cold air sourced from Canada, blowing cyclonically around low-pressure located above the Great Lakes, becoming a returning south-westerly or westerly flow depending on location.\u201d  Updated at 9.51pm GMT    9.07pm    The plenary has now been put back to 0000 EET. It remains to be seen if it will actually happen then.  It may be useful to read my colleague Fiona Harvey\u2019s report on the day so far.   Deep divisions threatened to derail the world\u2019s chances of limiting the climate crisis last night as negotiators struggled to keep nations working together to tackle global heating. In a day of high drama at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, bitter conflict broke out between wealthy and poorer nations. Some of the world\u2019s poorest countries denounced the rich for delaying action and refusing financial assistance to those suffering devastating extreme weather. Rich countries sought to argue that rapidly growing economies such as China and oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and other petro-states should contribute to rather than receive from funds to repair climate \u201closs and damage\u201d. The UK fought hard throughout the day to keep alive a global vow made last year at Cop26 in Glasgow, of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Some nations \u2013 including Saudi Arabia, Brazil and at some points China \u2013 had threatened to unpick this commitment, weakening the temperature goal and removing the requirement made at Glasgow for countries to update their emissions-cutting plans each year. That unpicking was unacceptable to many developed and developing countries, which see the Glasgow commitments as a minimum that should be improved on, not rolled back. \u201cWhat we are seeing is Glasgow minus, and we need to see Glasgow plus,\u201d said one developed country negotiator. Alok Sharma, the UK\u2019s president of Cop26, warned the Egyptian hosts that the fortnight-long conference would be a failure unless the 1.5C goal was kept alive. The Egyptian hosts came in for strong criticism over their methods of brokering a deal, by showing drafts of the final text to selected countries individually, rather than allowing them to work together. One veteran delegate called it \u201cun-transparent, unpredictable and chaotic\u201d. There was also a rare moment of unity, when the US and China unexpectedly patched up their diplomatic row and revived a joint partnership that will mean the world\u2019s two biggest emitters, and biggest economies, cooperate on ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions.       8.37pm    The hour is late and the Cop27 talks have veered close at times to what some feared to be complete collapse, but there is still the occasional sprinkling of optimism to be found around Sharm el-Sheikh. If it is kept in the final text, the progress on loss and damage, a central theme of the summit for developing countries, is an \u201chistoric step\u201d, according to Maisa Rojas, Chile\u2019s environment minister, although she noted much more needed to be done to keep the 1.5C goal viable. There are still grumbles \u2013 the opposition from Russia and Saudi Arabia to any mention of winding down the era of fossil fuels among them \u2013 but activists are hopeful of taking away something positive from Cop27. Meanwhile Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, was full of positivity. \u201cThe country pavilions are torn down and the water tanks empty, but the spirits are high. Climate-vulnerable nations and civil society are beaming at a big step forward on creating a loss and damage fund, more than a decade in the making.\u201d Su said that the openness of the US to phasing out fossil fuels \u2013 the Americans are also believed to be largely on board with attempts to create a loss and damage facility \u2013 has added to the encouragement. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t feel this surreal, but it seems like for this fleeting moment politicians are listening to the people, not polluters,\u201d she said.  Updated at 8.43pm GMT    8.21pm    I\u2019ve just been contacted by Alexander Lagaaij with the sad news that the closing plenary has now been put back to 2300 EET. Lagaaij, by the way, has a blog with photographs of the extraordinary journey he has been making on his bicycle. A nice mental detour from the long negotiations taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh.  Updated at 8.24pm GMT    8.03pm    There are now reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia are saying that even mentioning \u201cfossil fuels\u201d in the text is an absolute red line, according to Leo Hickman, an ex-Guardian journalist who now runs the excellent Carbon Brief.   Updated at 8.05pm GMT    7.53pm    Our correspondent Fiona Harvey has just had a brief conversation with the spokesperson for the Egyptian Cop presidency, Ahmed Abu Zeid. Things are \u201cprogressing\u201d, apparently.   Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.40pm    Aruna Chandrasekhar of Carbon Brief is taking a closer look at the now-published draft text on the funding mechanism for loss and damage.  She points out that the proposal \u201cmakes it clear that #LossAndDamageFinance would be housed both under the Paris Agreement and Convention\u201d, which will be reassuring to many. There would be \u201cnew funding arrangements to complement and include sources, funds and initiatives under and outside the Convention and Agreement,\u201d she adds.  Her colleague Josh Gabbatiss is going into the details too:  He notes: \u201cThey\u2019ve thrown in an extra \u2018particularly vulnerable\u2019 which \u2013 as I\u2019m sure is clear to everyone \u2013 is apparently different to \u2018most vulnerable\u2019.\u201d  Updated at 7.50pm GMT    7.29pm    The final plenary was originally due to start at 1900 EET, and was then pushed back to 2100 EET. It has since been pushed back again, to 2200 EET.   There are currently 253 people (including us) watching a blank feed.  This is Bibi van der Zee, by the way, taking over from Natalie Hanman.      6.54pm   US unlikely to block loss and damage fund  UN climate summits work by consensus, which means any nation can block an agreement. In the closing plenary at Cop26 in Glasgow last year, India almost brought the Cop president Alok Sharma to tears by demanding that \u201cphase out coal\u201d was watered down to \u201cphase down\u201d. A potential flashpoint for the closing plenary at Cop27 is the establishment of a loss and damage fund, which would provide money for poorer nations to rebuild after climate disasters. The US has long opposed this, fearing that \u2013 as the world\u2019s biggest polluter over time \u2013 it could face huge liabilities. But it looks unlikely that the US will block the loss and damage fund that is in the current draft text. A person close to the negotiations has just told my colleague Fiona Harvey: \u201cThe US is working to sign on [on loss and damage].\u201d The New York Times is also reporting that the US is willing to accept the creation of a loss and damage fund, while a source told Reuters the US is working to find a way it can agree to the proposal.     6.15pm    \u201cTiny, tiny\u201d things need to be resolved before a climate deal is finalised at the Cop27 summit in Egypt, the special representative to the Cop president has said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our best. Tiny, tiny things to work out,\u201d Wael Aboulmagd told Reuters when asked whether a deal was near. The closing plenary session is currently scheduled for 9pm local time, though it has been repeatedly put back throughout the day.     5.59pm    Scientists in the UK have also been sharing their views with journalists as Cop27 enters the final stages. Here\u2019s a selection: Prof Kevin Anderson, professor of energy &amp; climate change at the Tyndall Centre, University of Manchester, said:  A year on from the Glasgow COP26, a further 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide has been spewed into the atmosphere, the post-Covid skies are again streaked with aircraft vapour trails and the oil and gas majors are enthusiastically drilling to hell and back, thanks to new licences issued by so-called climate-progressive governments.  Set against this, another miserable facade of climate concern grinds to its \u2018Groundhog\u2019 end in the holiday resort of Sharm el-Sheikh \u2026 Offering superficially measured accounts of \u2018this minor success\u2019, \u2018that improvement in wording\u2019 or of a \u2018few financial crumbs begrudgingly thrown at poorer nations\u2019 only feeds into the business-as-usual circus that annual COP cycles have become.  Reasoned careful analysis and honest brokering are prerequisites of successful outcomes, but they are far from sufficient. As it is, they risk legitimising what is an increasingly corrupt and immoral process. As we burn through the carbon budget for a 50% chance of not exceeding 1.5C, at 1% every month, perhaps those genuinely concerned about climate change need to shout loud and long for an alternative structure for COP28.\u201d  Dr Elena Cantarello, principal academic in sustainability science at Bournemouth University, said:  Like with any other COPs, more could have been done. However, there was progress on several fronts. Loss and damage was for the first time put on the agenda and there was appreciation of the moral case that climate change has been largely caused by industrialised countries but worst impacts are felt by those who have contributed the least to the problem \u2026  The so called \u2018just energy transition partnership\u2019 process to do big deals for countries like Indonesia is very exciting. However, as COP27 is closing, it looks like they are still going to decide on \u2018phasing down\u2019 of fossil fuels and not \u2018phasing out\u2019 in line with the scientific evidence.\u201d  Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds, said:  It is all too easy to write COP27 off as a confused failure. But weaning the world off the heroin of fossil fuels was never going to be a cakewalk. The harrowing evidence of loss and damage presented at COP27 shows that continued fossil fuel use has become too expensive for the world to bear. In the negotiations, it was clear that countries want to quit the habit, even though they are still squabbling over who pays the rehab bill.\u201d  Dr Sugandha Srivastav, postdoctoral researcher in environmental economics, Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, said:  Even though we have international negotiations every year, our focus should be on what we do in the space between these. We must reinvigorate and energise climate-conscious citizen groups and green businesses. We should focus on the narrative of co-benefits and win-wins \u2013 there\u2019s not enough of that.\u201d  Dr James Dyke, of Exeter\u2019s Global Systems Institute, said:  I struggle to understand how anyone can continue to argue that 1.5 is still alive. I certainly don\u2019t believe any politicians involved in COP27 have any intentions of implementing the transformative policies that 1.5 now demands.  We are now entering a much warmer and more dangerous world. Loss and damages will increase, along with more human suffering and more destruction of the natural world. There is no way to spin this other than a colossal failure.  One thing that can be salvaged from this situation is that we now have an opportunity to learn from this failure. If the UNFCCC cannot produce transformative change, then we must urgently organise and generate effective action using other means. We can\u2019t take back the emissions we have poured into the atmosphere, but there is still a future that we can choose for ourselves.\u201d   Updated at 6.13pm GMT    5.45pm    National delegates have been commenting as the negotiations at Cop27 enter the endgame in this round up from Reuters. Susana Muhamad, Colombia\u2019s environment minister, says:  \u201cWe hope to have two things which will make this a valuable Cop. One, this commitment to 1.5C with clear decisions and no backing back. And second, that the loss and damage fund will be fundamental. But one without the other, it doesn\u2019t make sense, because otherwise we will be accepting catastrophe, and not pushing forward towards avoiding the worst of climate change.\u201d  Romina Pourmokhtari, Sweden\u2019s climate minister, says:  \u201cIt is not acceptable that we will fund the consequences of climate change [via a loss and damage fund] while not also committing to working on the actual consequences of the emissions.\u201d  Chris Bowen, Australia\u2019s climate change minister, says:  \u201cAustralia\u2019s position is clear and strong: there can be no sliding back from Glasgow and the text should be strengthened where possible.\u201d  Kunal Satyarthi, India\u2019s negotiator on loss and damage, says:  \u201cEverybody was flexible for the cause of loss and damage and the disasters and people dying and the economy being lost. I thank all the parties ... who were not flexible initially, but who [are] flexible now.\u201d      5.33pm    As we on the Guardian\u2019s environment desk revise our weekend rota for the likely possibility that negotiations go on and on, Carbon Reporter has been keeping track of how Cop27 compares with previous Cops in terms of a late finish.  It\u2019s 19.32 local time in Sharm el-Sheikh, so that puts it in the top 10 \u2013 for now, between Warsaw and Bali \u2026 but let\u2019s see where we end up. I\u2019m Natalie Hanman, head of environment, taking over from Bibi van der Zee for the next few hours. Please send me your thoughts, tips and hopes: natalie.hanman@theguardian.com or @nataliehanman  Updated at 5.52pm GMT    5.13pm    The \u201cmitigation work programme\u201d is a part of the UN climate negotiations that sets out how countries will deliver emissions cuts to close the large gap between where the world is now and where it desperately needs to be. It is crucial to keeping global heating below the agreed 1.5C limit and is therefore a potential flashpoint as Cop27 nears its conclusion. The new agreement for the programme proposed by the Egyptian presidency does say it would run until 2030, rather than just a year as some nations wanted. But it also rules out any new targets or goals, according to Tom Evans, policy advisor at thinktank E3G. That would mean no faster timelines for the delivery of better emissions-cutting pledges from countries, or setting dates by which coal should be phased out, or global emissions should peak. \u201cThe text talks about a transition to renewable energy and that\u2019s welcome,\u201d Evans said. \u201cBut there is nothing in there on fossil fuels, meaning there\u2019s nothing in there on the actual cause of climate change.\u201d A Saudi Arabian delegate told delegates on Friday afternoon: \u201cWe should not target sources of energy, we should focus on emissions. We should not mention fossil fuels.\u201d     5.05pm    Given that no one knows exactly when this will all end, a nap is an extremely good idea.    Updated at 5.08pm GMT    4.39pm   Issues around Loss and Damage continue to be in play  OK, we are now hearing that the draft text was altered during the afternoon to include a phrase important to the EU, which is to prioritise \u201cparticularly vulnerable countries\u201d as recipients of the fund. The EU\u2019s concern is that the fund should not be used by countries with significant economic resources of their own \u2013 and often with high oil revenues \u2013 that are still classed as developing because the definition of developing countries has not changed since 1992 when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed. Countries such as Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia could be eligible for funds if the definition of recipients was merely \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d. Will the G77 bloc find that acceptable? It\u2019s problematic because it seems as if there are different versions of the text on this very sensitive issue circulating at the same time. Nina Lakhani has been speaking to Meena Raman at Third World Network, who points out that the phrase \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d is in the original convention, and is defined by geographies. So even if the EU wants to exclude some countries, the convention has the final say. Harjeet Singh at Climate Action Network agrees with this analysis: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exclude any country but prioritises the vulnerable ones.\u201d  Updated at 5.10pm GMT    4.12pm    This is a good take on the state of play from Tan Copsey at ClimateNexus.    All the countries at Cop27 will have digested the texts on key climate issues that were proposed by the Egyptian presidency, deciding what they can swallow and what they can\u2019t. The heads of delegations are due to meet with the Cop presidency in a private meeting soon. If they can all more or less agree on the texts, quite possibly with some changes, then the closing plenary should go ahead this evening.  Updated at 4.18pm GMT    3.45pm    The High Ambition Coalition (HAC) of nations has just set out its stall for the endgame of Cop27, which will play out in a closing plenary session. As UN climate summits work on consensus, any nation can block proposals in the decision texts, but the fact the plenary is scheduled would normally indicate the presidency of the Cop thinks agreement is close. The HAC position was set out by Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands. She was flanked by the UK\u2019s Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, and Jennifer Morgan, representing Germany, among others.  \u201cAs we watch the devastating impacts of climate change this year, and the multiple and interrelated crises that grip our world, exacerbating the suffering of the poor, marginalised and vulnerable, we come together to say that we must emerge from Cop27 with a package of outcomes that keeps 1.5C alive and protects the world\u2019s vulnerable.\u201d \u201cThe Cop27 decision must reflect that we hold fast to our commitment to 1.5C and recognise the IPCC [scientists\u2019] finding that to keep 1.5C in reach, global emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest. This Cop decision must put the world on a path to phasing out all fossil fuels and an urgent, just transition to renewables.\u201d Currently, the proposed text does not call for the phasing out of all fossil fuels and some recalcitrant nations are known to oppose including text on an emissions peak by 2025. Stege also said: \u201c[The Cop decision must] support the agreement on new funding arrangements for loss and damage, including a loss and damage response fund at Cop27, and recognise that we will need to sprint together to operationalise this response in the coming year.\u201d The establishment of a fund to help vulnerable nations rebuild after climate disasters was the key demand for Cop27 from developing nations. Stege also called for the \u201caffirmation of the importance of accountability for climate finance commitments\u201d. That is likely to refer to the failure of rich nations to deliver a promised $100bn a year to poorer nations, which has seriously undermined the trust of developing nations in the UN climate talks. The plenary is scheduled to start at 6pm local time. Only then will we see just how hard nations are prepared to fight for their goals.  Updated at 3.57pm GMT    3.23pm   'Very constructive' discussions between China and US, but no change on finance issues  My colleague Fiona Harvey is reporting that China and the US have renewed their partnership to tackle the climate crisis, and are working closely and productively on ways of bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, according to China\u2019s head of delegation. The surprise news from Xie Zhenhua, who briefed a small group of journalists at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt on Saturday, comes as a rare moment of progress amid a conference mired in bitter fighting between developed and developing countries.  Xie said he and John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, had enjoyed \u201cvery constructive\u201d discussions. \u201cWe have had a close and active dialogue, that was overall very constructive. [We want to] ensure the success of Cop27 and exchange opinions on our differences.\u201d His words reflected a warm and personal dialogue. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Mr Kerry. I admire his professional attitude and love. We have been working together for 20 years and share a common wish.\u201d Xie revealed on Saturday that they intended to carry on with formal meetings after Cop27, in the hope of forging greater progress on vital issues such as low-carbon technology and reducing emissions of methane, the powerful greenhouse gas. He said: \u201cWe have agreed that after this Cop we will continue formal conversations, including face-to-face meetings.\u201d However, he is refusing to budge over China\u2019s status as a developing country, which has been one of the many themes of the talks. Xie repeated the Chinese position that it was still a developing country, and as such had no obligation to provide financial assistance to poor nations. He said China voluntarily provided help to countries in Latin America, Africa and elsewhere, including help with early warning systems of extreme weather, access to renewable energy technology, and \u201ccapacity building\u201d for governments. \u201c[In a] loss and damage fund, if there is any fund, the responsibility to provide funds lies with developed countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is their responsibility and obligation. Developing countries can contribute on a voluntary basis.\u201d He added: \u201cThe recipients should be developing countries. I hope it will be provided to fragile countries first \u2026 and those who need it most, first.\u201d  Updated at 3.46pm GMT    3.06pm    More reaction on the draft text on loss and damage, this time from Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, who is calling on the UK to support the proposal. \u201cThis draft text on loss and damage is a sliver of hope for vulnerable countries who are already facing the devastating impacts of the climate crisis and have fought tooth and nail for this outcome. It is a testament to their decades of perseverance that we even have loss and damage on the agenda at all. \u201cThere are huge battles ahead to ensure this move results in additional, equitable funding arrangements for loss and damage, but for now, we call on the UK in these final hours to support this text and use its position to ask the EU and US to do the same.\u201d  Updated at 3.09pm GMT    2.42pm    It seems as though governments have agreed on the text for article 6, the controversial carbon markets part of the Paris accords. The text was adopted without debate during the final negotiations this morning amid applause and cheers that states could now move to implementation.  It sends the issue of whether carbon removal projects (such as carbon capture and storage) could be considered suitable for credits back to the UN supervisory board, and is basically kicking the decision down the road to next year.  The new text doesn\u2019t appear to include any guidance on ensuring the revised recommendations are in line with science, international law, human rights or the rights of Indigenous peoples. It also doesn\u2019t require that governance procedures \u2013 such as an independent grievance mechanism that was agreed in Glasgow \u2013 are established before implementation of article 6, though the supervisory board will hold consultations. Lastly, the text doesn\u2019t lock in the requirement for transparency mechanisms, leaving the potential for confidentiality clauses that would allow countries to hide who is using offsets, when they use them, and to what aim. Corporate watchdogs and Indigenous rights groups are very concerned that existing loopholes have been expanded. Rachel Rose Jackson from Corporate Accountability said: \u201cThese outcomes are only worthy of celebration if you are either a carbon marketeer about to profit immensely, or the global north governments who are locking in their ability to recklessly use offsets and removals \u2013 without required human rights and other safeguards \u2013 to ignore their obligation to actually reduce emissions. This is not reflective of keeping 1.5 alive.\u201d Erika Lennon, senior attorney at Centre for International Environmental Law (Ciel), said there was little to cheer about. \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results, this is exactly what is happening at Cop27. Without reference to human rights, international law and science in the guidance there is a high risk that the supervisory body once again will fail people and Indigenous communities around the world while setting the world on a course to blow past 1.5C.\u201d  Updated at 3.13pm GMT    2.12pm    My colleague Nina Lakhani has been getting some more reaction on the most recent draft text on loss and damage. Andres Mogro, finance negotiator for the G77 and China, told the Guardian he welcomed the news of the fund. \u201cWe hope that when it becomes operational it can reflect the level of urgency and the needs of developing countries. A big responsibility is now in the hands of the committee that will design the fund.\u201d  Updated at 2.26pm GMT    1.56pm    At this stage of Cop, most of the corporate stands are being dismantled and the cafes are being packed up. World leaders have all gone home, or off to another global meeting. Now it\u2019s just the delegates and campaigners, huddling in corridors and meeting rooms, or getting a bit of fresh air outside for a moment, and trying to hammer out the deal.       Updated at 2.07pm GMT    1.34pm   Lunchtime summary  Hallo, this is Bibi van der Zee, taking over from Damian Carrington. Please send me thoughts and views as the afternoon progresses, at bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com, or @bibivanderzee. It\u2019s been an extremely busy morning at the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh. Here\u2019s a quick summary of events so far this morning.  The day began in some disarray, with grave concerns that the target of keeping global warming to within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels was at risk. The EU bloc went as far as saying that they would rather have \u201cno decision than a bad decision\u201d Australia\u2019s climate minister confirmed that there had been significant disputes over 1.5 during the talks. Meanwhile the Egyptian presidency of Cop was coming in for increasing criticism for the way it had run negotiations. But the Cop president, Sameh Shoukry, said the latest text would keep the 1.5C target alive. Campaigners warned that the state of the discussions was so polarised and incoherent that, according to David Tong of Oil Change International, they \u201cwere on the verge of a breakdown\u201d. John Kerry, the US climate change negotiator, is in isolation with Covid-19. Spain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribeira, announced her willingness to walk out in protest if she felt that the deal was backtracking on \u201cwhat we already did in Glasgow\u201d. But then a new batch of draft texts were distributed, and these have seen far more positive responses, although still with plenty of qualifications. Of specific interest is a potential call to reform the global financial system and, more importantly, a proposal for a fund for loss and damage which is so far being welcomed by some of the developing countries and campaigners. However it does not call for \u201cphase down of all fossil fuels\u201d.  Let\u2019s see what the afternoon brings.  Updated at 1.50pm GMT    12.54pm   Proposal for vital loss and damage fund welcomed by developing nations  Is the gloomy mood of this morning at Cop27 starting to lift? A new draft text that would see a loss and damage fund established is being welcomed by some developing nations and campaigners. The fund, to provide poorer, vulnerable nations money to rebuild after climate disasters, is the key demand from the global south at the summit. Alpha Oumar Kaloga from the Guinea delegation told my colleague Nina Lakhani he is overjoyed at the progress on loss and damage.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting moment, after 30 years of patience, 30 years of struggle, 30 years of trying to get recognition and concrete action on loss and damage. This is now a path, we have arranged a new funding arrangement that will address loss and damage in developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Developed countries wanted to pick and choose which countries would benefit, but now we have an agreement that all developing countries will be eligible. This is a unique and exciting moment.\u201d   Meena Raman, the Malaysia-based director of the Third World Network and an expert on the Cop negotiations, also welcomed the new text, reports Nina Lakhani. \u201cThis was the result of a united G77 and China under the leadership of Pakistan, who had the strong moral voice to speak up for those who have died or been devastated by climate disasters,\u201d said Raman. \u201cIt is the best possible compromise given the intransigence of the developed world.\u201d Joe Lo, from Climate Home News, says Harjeet Singh, from Climate Action Network, has welcomed the new text.  Of course, there may be further twists and turns, as nations can raise late objections. It is not over until everything is agreed by everyone.  Updated at 2.09pm GMT    12.39pm     Money has always been critical to UN climate talks, but even more so at Cop27. That\u2019s because rich nations have failed to deliver on their promise of $100bn a year by 2020 to fund emissions cuts and projects to protect against extreme weather. Furthermore, the impacts of global heating are hitting increasingly hard from Pakistan to Puerto Rico, meaning funds to rebuild are urgently needed. One of the biggest ideas to raise big sums is major reform of the global financial system and in particular the World Bank, IMF and other multilateral development banks. That has been championed by prime minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, but also supported by France and other large economies. Now the reform proposal has made it into the draft of the Cop27 decision text. If it remains there at the end, it will be a first:  There is much more on climate finance in this article, published just before Cop27:      12.20pm   Latest draft of Cop27 decision text does not call for 'phase down of all fossil fuels'  The new draft texts on the key issues at Cop27 are flooding in now, and Simon Evans at Carbon Brief is ploughing through them (see the two previous posts).  Evans notes this is only a proposal from the Egyptian Cop27 president: \u201cOne very conspicuous absence is any reference to phasing fossil fuels down, or out. Instead it copies Glasgow Cop26 text on coal phase down and \u2018inefficient\u2019 fossil fuel subsidy phaseout.\u201d India and the US had supported putting \u201cphase down all fossil fuels\u201d in the text. More on that here, from earlier in the week:   Updated at 1.37pm GMT    12.12pm    As well as a new draft text on \u201clong term finance\u201d (see previous post), Simon Evans at Carbon Brief has been looking at the new draft on loss and damage, the issue of funding for vulnerable nations to rebuild after unavoidable climate disasters.  A loss and damage fund is the critical demand by developing nations at Cop27, and this text would deliver it.  Updated at 12.13pm GMT    12.05pm    New draft texts on key issues here at Cop27 are being released, and Simon Evans at Carbon Brief has been keeping a close eye on them.  The \u201ccover decision\u201d is the final Cop27 statement agreed by nations, which is politically very important. The $100bn is the annual sum rich nations promised to deliver to poorer, vulnerable countries by 2020. They have failed to do so, hugely undermining levels of trust between countries.  More on that here:       11.50am    Zahir Fakir, from the South African delegation, has a grim analogy for the stage reached by the Cop27 negotiations:  He is likely to be referring to some countries holding fast on their positions while others end up giving up on their goals. Harjeet Singh, the India-based head of global political strategy for Climate Action Network, a coalition of 1,900 civil society groups in 150 countries, said the 1.5C commitment being stressed by the EU and other countries was meaningless if rich polluting nations didn\u2019t pay their climate debts:  \u201cHow can we stay below 1.5C when rich countries continue to invest in fossil fuels and refuse to do their fair share of climate action, while failing to provide adequate climate finance to developing countries to support the just energy transition.\u201d  The Centre for International Environmental Law (Ciel) is worried about the final text on carbon markets (article 6.4 in the Paris agreement), which is intended to set the rules for the controversial trade in carbon credits. Erika Lennon, senior attorney at Ciel, said the latest text eliminates reference to human rights, including the rights of Indigenous peoples.  \u201cIn the last hours of the climate talks, states are yet again showing that they are willing to sacrifice people in order to postpone meaningful climate action and shield corporate profits.\u201d  Without reference to human rights, international law, and science in the guidance, there is a high risk that the \u201csupervisory body\u201d once again will fail people and Indigenous communities around the world, while setting the world on a course to blow past 1.5C, Lennon said.  Updated at 12.06pm GMT    11.27am    A key criticism levelled at rich, developed nations at the UN climate talks is that many are still enabling new fossil fuel exploitation, as Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network, says here:  The International Energy Agency has been clear that new fossil fuel projects are not compatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and ending the climate crisis. In the first week of Cop27, a report from NGO Urgewald revealed oil and gas companies were planning a \u201cfrightening\u201d expansion that would result in 115bn tonnes of climate-heating CO<sub>2</sub> being pumped out, equivalent to more than 24 years of US emissions.  Updated at 11.49am GMT    11.09am     More strong reaction to how events are unfolding at Cop27 from Spain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, via Associated Press. She said Spain was willing to walk out if a \u201cfair\u201d deal could not be sealed at the UN climate talks. \u201cWe could be exiting of course,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be part of a result that we find unfair and not effective to address the problem that we are handling, which is climate change and the need to reduce emissions.\u201d Ribera said she is \u201cconcerned\u201d that a draft of the final document may not include a mention of the 1.5C global heating limit target set in Paris in 2015.She said she did not want to see a result \u201cthat may backtrack what we already did in Glasgow,\u201d referring to the renewed commitment to the 1.5C goal at the Cop26 climate summit last year. She also criticised the Egyptian presidency, which is running the summit, saying the process has been \u201cvery confusing\u201d. She said: \u201cIt is not clear and we are running out of time.\u201d There is always brinkmanship at Cops, but it is clear things are not going at all well in Sharm el-Sheikh. Only one Cop has ever failed to reach conclusion \u2013 Cop6 back in 2001, according to Arthur Wyns:   Updated at 11.28am GMT    10.50am   Draft agreement 'abandons really any hope of achieving 1.5C', says New Zealand minister  The Associated Press has some ministerial reaction to the latest draft of the final Cop27 agreement. New Zealand\u2019s climate minister, James Shaw, said the draft circulated by the Egyptian presidency running the negotiations \u201chas been received quite poorly by pretty much everybody\u201d. He called the draft \u201centirely unsatisfactory\u201d, adding that the proposal \u201cabandons really any hope of achieving 1.5C\u201d, the global heating limit agreed in the Paris agreement back in 2015. Shaw said the delegations were going into another round of talks: \u201cEverybody wants an outcome on loss and damage and everybody wants to keep 1.5 alive. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to keep doing.\u201d German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said responsibility for the fate of the UN climate talks \u201cnow lies in the hands of the Egyptian Cop presidency\u201d.  She said the EU had made clear overnight that \u201cwe will not sign a paper here that would bury the goal of 1.5C degrees\u201d. Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, tweeted this earlier:   Updated at 11.08am GMT    10.38am    Cops are always a test of stamina for delegates, struggling by on little sleep, and in Sharm el-Sheikh on little food and coffee. Now there is a new metric on how long the negotiations will last.  For those unaware, the UK tabloid newspaper the Daily Star grabbed attention during the recent ill-fated premiership of Liz Truss by running a webcam to see whether she or a lettuce would last longer. The lettuce won.  Updated at 10.46am GMT    10.29am    UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, read the riot act to delegates on Friday, urging them to act. So far, it hasn\u2019t worked.  More on how Guterres has been ramping up his blistering attacks on climate inaction and the fossil fuel industry here:      10.23am    A typically trenchant take on Cop27, and indeed all Cops, from Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who has not been in Egypt.      10.10am    The US, as the world\u2019s biggest economy and biggest emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> over time, is always central to Cop negotiations. But the veteran leader of its delegation, John Kerry, will not be on site today, having caught Covid. The US statement said:  Secretary Kerry is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19 in Sharm el-Sheikh. He is fully vaccinated and boosted and experiencing mild symptoms. He is working with his negotiations team and foreign counterparts by phone to ensure a successful outcome of Cop27.  The endgame of Cops sees negotiators shuttling between rooms and huddles, and not being on the scene will make it hard for Kerry.   Updated at 10.23am GMT    10.04am   Situation 'deeply worrying' with talks 'on the verge of a breakdown', warn civil society groups  Civil society groups have held a press conference, with some veteran activists saying this is the closest they have seen UN climate talks come to breaking down completely, and there is a real risk that could happen. David Tong, a campaigner with Oil Change International based in New Zealand, said he had been to eight Cops, including Durban in 2011 which did not finish until the Sunday morning. He said he had never seen a situation like this morning\u2019s in Sharm el-Sheikh, where a major player in the talks \u2013 the EU \u2013 and the Cop27 president had given back-to-back press conferences that were at odds with each other to the point of indicating there was no agreement in sight. \u201cEvery Cop reaches a strange challenging endgame and at every Cop I\u2019ve seen we reach a point where it looks like negotiations might collapse, but this looks like something else,\u201d Tong said. \u201cNegotiations are on the verge of a breakdown even more so than in other years. We have not seen the text,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we understand it, parties have not been given a copy of the text. They have been shown the text. We\u2019re hearing conflicting things about what the text is saying, but what we\u2019re hearing is deeply worrying.\u201d Tong said any final text must not backslide on what was agreed in the Glasgow pact at Cop26, needs to establish a fund to finance loss and damage, protect the goal of aiming to limit global heating to 1.5C, and reflect the clear scientific conclusion that the world needs to phase out fossil fuels. It is worth remembering that, back in 2015, countries asked the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to look at the impacts of 1.5C of heating. The IPCC found the difference between that goal and 2C was vast in terms of the catastrophic damage that would be suffered, particularly in vulnerable countries.  Updated at 10.28am GMT    9.48am    I\u2019m taking over the live blog now \u2013 I\u2019m Damian Carrington, environment editor at the Guardian. Send me your news and views on Cop27 by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com or via Twitter @dpcarrington (DMs open). No one knows how long it will take for the world\u2019s countries to come to an agreement in Egypt, but it\u2019s looking possible the negotiations will drag on into Sunday. Extra time is usual at Cops, but they have been overrunning by more and more as Joe Goodman, from Carbon Brief, has charted here:  The unenviable record was set by at Cop25 in Madrid in 2019, which did not end until 1:54pm on the Sunday. Exhausted negotiators will be praying a new record will not be set at Sharm el-Sheikh.  Updated at 9.57am GMT    9.43am    The main sticking point of Cop27 has been over the creation of a loss and damage fund \u2013 finance provided by rich nations to poorer ones to help them prepare for and recover from the worst impacts of climate breakdown. Some, especially in the rightwing press, have framed this as \u201creparations\u201d, a highly loaded term. It\u2019s also misleading, as under article 8 of the Paris climate agreement it is explicitly made clear that loss and damage \u201cdoes not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation\u201d. Some activists, however, say that people should be talking about reparations, as it was the industrialisation of the west that made it rich and is now causing terrible impacts in countries that did not profit. Fiona Harvey, Nina Lakhani and Damien Gayle have dug into the thorny issue of how to discuss climate finance in this excellent piece:   Updated at 9.56am GMT    9.31am    Asad Rehman, the director of War on Want and one of the most outspoken figures at the climate talks, takes issue with EU climate chief Frans Timmermans\u2019s \u201cNo decision is better than a bad decision\u201d comment:  Some people have interpreted the EU\u2019s move to support the creation of a loss and damage fund as a tactic to divide the G77 bloc of vulnerable countries from China, historically an ally at climate talks.  Updated at 9.37am GMT    9.20am    My colleagues Ruth Michaelson and Patrick Greenfield have been looking at Saudi Arabia\u2019s change in tactics at climate talks, which have moved from outright obstruction to a focus on carbon capture and storage, a technology which is still in its infancy but on which the kingdom\u2019s carbon targets rely.  Critics say the move is designed to buy time to be allowed to continue to produce fossil fuels rather than switching to renewable energy. Read the full piece here:       9.07am   Cop27 president insists text does keep 1.5C target alive  Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry has just been talking to the media, and my colleague Adam Morton was listening. The Egyptian presidency is coming in for increasing criticism on how it is handling the negotiations. Shoukry said the delegates had worked through the night but that this had not resulted in any clear direction towards consensus on the key issues of keeping the 1.5C target alive and funding for loss and damage caused by climate disasters. Shoukry said the presidency had provided a text for the final Cop decision that was balanced, incorporating language, ideas that reflected views of all countries. He said that text constituted a basis for moving forward, while none of the country groupings could say that all of their interests had been met. He said the text did keep 1.5C alive, contrary to the fears of the EU. The issue now rests with the will of the countries, or parties as they are called at Cops. \u201cIt is the parties that must rise to the occasion,\u201d said Shoukry. \u201cThe world is watching, time is not on our side, and all must show flexibility. What we\u2019re doing is providing the environment that can accommodate the position of various parties.\u201d There is never a perfect solution, he said. He would not comment directly on the EU\u2019s concerns: \u201cEvery party has a full right to join consensus or not join consensus.\u201d In response to criticism of the presidency, Shoukry said it had been fully involved all through the two weeks of Cop27, especially on issue of loss and damage.  Updated at 9.17am GMT    8.55am   What to expect today  It\u2019s going to be a busy and confusing day at Cop27, so here\u2019s what you need to know to understand what is going on. First, the UN climate summits work by consensus. That means there are no votes and instead countries must all agree on decisions, or at least not be strongly opposed. As a result, the talks always go into extra time, as nations hold out for their goals. The consensus mechanism places a huge responsibility on the Cop president, in this case Sameh Shoukry, Egypt\u2019s foreign minister. He must guide countries firmly but fairly to common ground. But the presidency is getting a lot of criticism for not pushing countries harder sooner. One observer said: \u201cVeterans are now branding this the worst organised Cop in 30 years.\u201d You also need a bit of history to understand the negotiations. Back in 1992 when the UN climate treaty was created, it divided the world into developed and developing nations. The treaty put the responsibility to act and to fund climate action on the developed countries. But in 1992, only a couple of dozen nations were deemed developed, mostly western European nations, plus the US, Australia and Japan. Today, the world is very different. China\u2019s economy is huge, other nations have got rich on fossil fuels, such as Saudi Arabia, and South Korea is highly developed. Many of the countries dubbed developing in 1992 are now major polluters too. This change has created serious tensions at Cops for years. The developed nations think the onus should no longer be on them alone to pay for climate action. The 1992 developing nations argue that the division is written into the treaty and must be respected. They also point out that developed nations haven\u2019t in any case fulfilled their promise to deliver $100bn in annual climate funds. The tension over the division is why the EU proposal on loss and damage is so striking. It promises the fund demanded by poor nations, to help rebuild after unavoidable climate disasters, but requires nations like China to contribute. The loss and damage issue is crucial at Cop27, but critics of the EU proposal say it only promises funding to the very poorest and most vulnerable countries, potentially excluding nations like Pakistan which suffered catastrophic floods this year. More on that from Fiona Harvey here:   Updated at 9.22am GMT    8.42am    Egyptian Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry is giving a press conference. He says negotiators worked through the night and that countries will be given more time to look at the texts. He insists the text keeps the 1.5C target alive and says the majority of parties who have seen the texts consider them \u201ca basis on which to move forward\u201d. Not language that sounds as though we\u2019ll be wrapping up any time soon.  Updated at 9.32am GMT    8.26am    My colleague Adam Morton spoke to Australia\u2019s climate minister, Chris Bowen, last night, who said that some countries were pushing to water down the language agreed at Paris and Glasgow, but that he and others had been pushing to keep it:  \u201cIt\u2019s important because if we\u2019re not trying to keep to 1.5C, then what are we here for? Because the difference between 1.5C and 1.7C in terms of the impact on the planet is enormous.\u201d  Read the full story here:   Updated at 8.40am GMT    8.17am   EU: 'No decision better than a bad decision'  AFP is reporting that a French minister has said the Egyptian conference hosts are proposing a text that is \u201cunacceptable\u201d:  The European Union on Saturday rejected as \u201cunacceptable\u201d a proposal from UN climate summit host Egypt for a deal at Cop27, a French official said, saying it was insufficiently ambitious on reducing carbon emissions. \u201cAt this stage, the Egyptian presidency is calling into question gains made in Glasgow on emissions reduction,\u201d the official from the French energy transition ministry said, referring to the outcome of last year\u2019s Cop26. \u201cThis is unacceptable for France and for European Union countries.\u201d  The EU climate chief, Frans Timmermans, has just given a press conference, where he said he believes a deal is possible but that the EU \u201cwould rather have no decision than a bad decision\u201d.  Updated at 8.44am GMT    8.09am    No new texts have emerged overnight, so the second draft is still the most recent that has been made public. Fiona Harvey has read between the lines of it to work out what\u2019s been settled and what\u2019s still a long way from being agreed:      8.00am   Fears 1.5C target in peril as Cop27 overruns  Hello, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing live coverage of the Cop27 climate conference. It was supposed to finish yesterday evening, but to nobody\u2019s surprise has been extended by a day. The mood this morning is sombre, and it appears the target agreed at the Paris Cop of holding global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels may be at risk. Frans Timmermans of the EU tweeted this this morning:  We\u2019ll be here bringing you the latest news and developments as they happen, but in the meantime you can catch up on what happened yesterday here:  I\u2019m Alan Evans, and you can reach me at alan.evans@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @itsalanevans.

                    "body": "  9.35pm    And here\u2019s our report. Thanks for reading!      8.51pm    And here\u2019s his defeated opponent Carlos Sainz: \u201cI was pushing flat out, I wasn\u2019t leaving any inch to the walls under braking. I tried everything to pass Max but the positive thing is we were quicker, we were faster in the race. We were very close to winning today so I\u2019ll take the positives.\u201d     8.49pm    Verstappen on his first win in Canada: \u201cThe safety car didn\u2019t help \u2026 overall Ferrari were very quick. Following is tricky around here but I could see him [Sainz] pushing, charging, pushing, charging. The last few laps were very fun!\u201d     8.47pm    How they finished: 1 Max Verstappen, Red Bull2 Carlos Sainz, Ferrari3 Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes4 George Russell, Mercedes5 Charles Leclerc, Ferrari6 Esteban Ocon, Alpine7 Fernando Alonso, Alpine8 Valtteri Bottas, Alfa Romeo9 Guanyu Zhou, Alfa Romeo10 Lance Stroll, Aston Martin     8.43pm   Max Verstappen wins the Canadian GP!  And that\u2019s that: after a desperately tense last 15 laps, Verstappen holds off Sainz with devilish composure and clocks up another win. As far as the drivers\u2019 championship goes, he is fast hotfooting it into the distance. Will this season\u2019s title turn into a cakewalk?     8.38pm    Lap 69/70: Verstappen goes slightly wide on the hairpin, offering Sainz an inch or two of leeway, but it\u2019s not enough. He\u2019s right on his gearbox going into the final lap.     8.37pm    Lap 68/70: Verstappen\u2019s lead still hovers at around 0.7sec. Time is running out for Sainz.     8.36pm    Lap 66/70: Alonso is told not to pass his teammate Ocon into P6 and responds grumpily: \u201cI\u2019m 100 times faster this weekend!\u201d     8.34pm    Lap 64/70: Still no joy for Sainz against the unflappable Verstappen. Behind them, Hamilton and Russell look nailed on for third and fourth, with Leclerc out on his own in fifth.     8.31pm    Lap 62/70: Verstappen is opening up the gap ever so slightly: it\u2019s now up to eight tenths. But that sliver of time could be everything. Stroll makes it into the points on home turf.     8.27pm    Lap 60/70: The Ferrari team seem to think Alonso has an engine problem. A mistake from Leclerc sees him lose a place to Ocon, which he quickly regains to re-enter the top five. Sainz still half a second behind Verstappen and desperate to have a nibble.  Updated at 8.29pm BST    8.25pm    Lap 59/70: He cannot. Verstappen just keeps enough daylight between them, getting out of every corner perfectly.      8.24pm    Lap 58/70: The gap is now half a second and Verstappen does well to hold Sainz off going around turn one. Can Sainz pick him off after the hairpin\u2026?     8.22pm    Lap 55/70: Less than 7secs separates the top 10. Alonso has slipped to P5 and is fully in the sights of Leclerc, who is awaiting DRS. Sainz sets a fastest lap to stay within a second of Verstappen.     8.21pm    Lap 55/70: Green flag. Verstappen races ahead and Sainz trails his gearbox diligently. Sainz won\u2019t get DRS for another two laps so this is a massive few minutes for him. He\u2019ll need to stick tight.  Updated at 8.21pm BST    8.16pm    Lap 52/70: Verstappen\u2019s tyres are seven laps older than those of Carlos Sainz, who has never won a GP before. Could today be the way\u2026? Tsunoda\u2019s car has been craned off the track, so the race will restart any moment.     8.10pm    Lap 50/70: Tsunoda\u2019s goose is cooked, his car going straight on as he came out of the pits with cold tyres. The yellow flag is out \u2013 and this plays into the hands of Sainz, who can use this interruption to get himself some fresh tyres and hunt down Verstappen. Game on!   Updated at 8.13pm BST    8.06pm    Lap 48/70: How they stand  1 Carlos SAINZ Ferrari  2 Max VERSTAPPEN Red Bull  3 Lewis HAMILTON Mercedes  4 George RUSSELL Mercedes  5 Esteban OCON Alpine  6 Fernando ALONSO Alpine  7 Valtteri BOTTAS Alfa Romeo  8 Lance STROLL Aston Martin  9 Charles LECLERC Ferrari  10 Guanyu ZHOU Alfa Romeo        8.05pm    Lap 46/70: Hamilton pits, leaving Verstappen to move into P2, 9secs behind Sainz. Leclerc has clambered back up to P10, and now eats up Ricciardo for P9. Russell pits, leaving Hamilton with a 6sec lead over his teammate.     8.03pm    Lap 44/70: Verstappen pits and 2.5secs later is back out on track with hard tyres. He re-enters wheel-to-wheel with Hamilton, who nudges him off to hold on to P2. Verstappen swears at his team down the radio. Lovely stuff.     8.00pm    Lap 42/70: Leclerc gets himself out of his private duel with a pitstop, which is a maddeningly slow one and sends him out shaking his head as he enters behind Ricciardo and Tsunoda in P12. Oh dear.     7.58pm    Lap 40/70: Ocon, in P5, continues to hold off Leclerc, who has been looming behind him for some time now. Yet his attempts at overtaking have been quashed every time at this one is no different.     7.55pm    Lap 38/50: It\u2019s spread out at the front, with Verstappen, Sainz, Hamilton, Russell and Ocon all at least 7secs away from each other. Gasly hits the pits again, coming out with fresh hard compounds.     7.51pm    Lap 35/70: Now it\u2019s Verstappen\u2019s turn to have a moan. \u201cI\u2019m really losing tyre grip,\u201d he tells his team. Leclerc and Stroll are the only drivers yet to pit at the halfway mark.     7.47pm    Lap 32/70: Sainz clocks up a fastest lap to trim Verstappen\u2019s lead to 8secs. Behind him, Hamilton and Russell look like they could end up scrapping for the final podium place, which would be fun.     7.45pm    Lap 30/70: Alonso bites the bullet at last and goes into the pits for hard compounds, coming out in P7 behind Leclerc, who has made up 13 places now but isn\u2019t a happy bunny. \u201cI don\u2019t have the grip!\u201d he yelps into the radio. \u201cI don\u2019t have the grip on the exits. No traction at all.\u201d     7.41pm    Lap 28/70: How they stand:  1 Max VERSTAPPEN, Red Bull  2 Carlos SAINZ, Ferrari  3 Lewis HAMILTON, Mercedes  4 Fernando ALONSO, Alpine  5 George RUSSELL, Mercedes  6 Esteban OCON, Alpine  7 Charles LECLERC, Ferrari  8 Valtteri BOTTAS, Alfa Romeo  9 Lance STROLL, Aston Martin  10 Guanyu ZHOU, Alfa Romeo     Updated at 7.52pm BST    7.39pm    Lap 26/60: Verstappen is sailing clear out front, almost 10secs ahead of Sainz, albeit with slightly older tyres. Impossible to see anyone catching him at this rate.     7.37pm    Lap 24/70: Pitting under VSC after Schumacher retired, Norris was let down by his team in hilarious style: they put the wrong tyres on, and had to scamper around correcting their error, leaving their man to re-enter in 17th. Honk.  Updated at 7.38pm BST    7.35pm    Lap 22/70: Hamilton has overtaken Russell, his teammate going in for hards under the VSC, and hares around Alonso to take third. A wonderful bit of driving get Leclerc past Bottas for P7 \u2013 that\u2019s 12 places he\u2019s made up now, though he is yet to pit.     7.32pm   Schumacher retires  Another one bites the dust \u2013 and dismay for Schumacher, who was hoping for some points today. Again, his car appeared to lose power. Sainz pits and Verstappen returns to P1.     7.30pm    Lap 20/70: A problem for Schumacher, whose car has rolled meekly off track, brings back the virtual safety car. Ocon and Guanyu pit.     7.29pm    Lap 19/20: Leclerc climbs past Stroll for P11 and closes in on Bottas, half a second behind a points spot.     7.28pm    Lap 16/70: The Mercedes pair of Russell and Hamilton are in P4 and P5 respectively, sandwiched between the Alpines of Alonso and Ocon. \u201cKeep it simple,\u201d Russell tells his engineer over the radio, talking strategy.     7.25pm    Lap 14/70: Leclerc picks off Norris for P12, while Verstappen puts his foot down on the straight and cruises past Alonso \u2013 whose tyres look to be losing grip \u2013 to claim second place. He\u2019s 5secs behind Sainz.     7.22pm    Lap 13/70: Christian Horner is deflated about Perez\u2019s retirement, already his team\u2019s fourth mechanical retirement of the season. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get our heads down now and do the best we can with Max,\u201d he mutters. He reckons it\u2019ll be two-stopper today.     7.20pm    Lap 11/70: As Verstappen warms up his new hard tyres, Hamilton does the same by roaring past Ocon for P5     7.18pm    Lap 9/70: Verstappen uses the opportunity to switch up his tyres, as does Hamilton. The rest opt to stay out. Sainz leads to race as the virtual safety car departs.     7.15pm   Perez retires!  Disaster for Sergio Perez, whose weekend of misery is compounded by what looks to be an engine failure. He trundles off the track as the virtual safety car comes into action.     7.14pm    Lap 8/70: The top five is Verstappen, Sainz, Alonso, Hamilton, Russell.     7.13pm    Lap 6/70: Magnussen pits; his problem seems resolved but that extra stop will cost him. Gasly and Vettel have both pitted early to switch to the hard compound tyre.     7.10pm    Lap 4/70: And a technical problem for Gasly too. Leclerc creeps up to 16th. Perez has climbed two places to P11. Hamilton attacks Alonso, who holds him off with DRS.     7.08pm    Lap 3/70: Sainz gets DRS and goes past his compatriot for second. Magnussen has some damage to his front wing.     7.07pm    Lap 2/70: Leclerc has made up a couple of places already; Verstappen has opened up a second and a half lead. Schumacher is having a tough old time of it, now passed by Russell.  Updated at 7.07pm BST    7.05pm    Lap 1/70: And we\u2019re away! Verstappen steams away and keeps Alonso at arm\u2019s length into turn one. Hamilton goes wheel to wheel with Magnussen in the first chicane but the Dane stands his ground. Ocon eases past Schumacher.   Updated at 7.05pm BST    7.01pm    The drivers zip away for the formation lap. Not long now. All eyes on turn one.     6.58pm    Steve Carbert writes in on the endangerment of F1\u2019s European leg: \u201cLooks like the money men have got a death grip on the sport, they\u2019ll be taking the show on the road to wherever the highest bidder resides. Sad days ahead I fear.\u201d Big sport? Selling itself to the highest bidder. Surely not.     6.50pm    Christian Horner speaks: \u201cFernando is going to be going for it, so we\u2019ve just got to try to get clear of that as soon as we can. You\u2019ve just got to get on with your own thing. We can\u2019t spend time worrying about what Fernando is going to do. Hopefully he\u2019s sensible we\u2019ve just got to get stuck in, and for Checo likewise.\u201d     6.49pm         6.45pm    Zhou Guanyu delivered the best qualifying performance of his career yesterday and wants to make good on that today. \u201cIt was a good day yesterday. Especially considering the conditions. Here we are, best position for the start, and the target is still to get into the points with both cars today. \u201cThere are a few cars ahead of us maybe who are a little bit slower than us, but of course there\u2019s a Red Bull and Ferrari behind us who will be going through the pack pretty quick.\u201d     6.39pm    Some pre-race reading, on the endangerment of F1\u2019s European leg:      6.27pm    Another victim of yesterday\u2019s conditions was Sergio Perez \u2013 second in the drivers\u2019 standings \u2013 who crashed out in Q2 and will start back in 13th today. \u201cI did a mistake from my side so I\u2019m very sorry for my team,\u201d he wailed afterwards. \u201cI let them down today unfortunately.\u201d With he and Leclerc starting down the field, and Mercedes still yet to overcome their aerodynamical headaches, could Alonso steal a rare podium finish? His last was in Qatar last year, which in turn was his first for 105 races. An outright triumph today would make him the oldest winner since Nigel Mansell in 1994.   Updated at 6.31pm BST    6.18pm    Some positive meteorological news, too, in that yesterday\u2019s deluges are nowhere to be seen. The rain has gone, so have the clouds and the cooler temperatures. Montreal is 18 degrees and sunny on race day.     6.13pm    The star of the show during yesterday\u2019s qualifying was undoubtedly Fernando Alonso, who screeched around a tricky circuit to land his first front-row start for a decade \u2013 though he was careful to strike a modest note afterwards. \u201cIt was not a normal qualifying or not a normal day,\u201d he said. \u201cFP1, we had a very dirty track. Very clean track. FP2, it was getting grippier and more normal. FP3 was wet and qualifying was just semi-dry. So we never had two consecutive sessions with the same conditions so you really had to adapt very fast to those new conditions that you are facing. \u201cSo it seems that we had the right confidence in the car, and a good set-up. So I think it\u2019s down to the team 50% and down to the driver that everything was OK today but it doesn\u2019t mean anything because I said the race is tomorrow and you make a mistake and you have zero points.\u201d  Here\u2019s our report from yesterday\u2019s qualifying:      6.00pm   Preamble  A penny for the thoughts of Charles Leclerc. Two months ago the Monegasque was coasting away from the chasing pack, looking every bit the champion-in-waiting after two wins from the first three races took him 34 points clear in the drivers\u2019 championship \u2013 and 46 clear of his most obvious title rival in Max Verstappen. But two months is a long time in Formula One, as the saying doesn\u2019t go, and poor Leclerc goes into today\u2019s Canadian GP having to treat it as a damage-limitation exercise for his title hopes. A frankly ludicrous 80-point swing over the last five races has taken Verstappen to the top of the leaderboard, where he is joined by teammate Sergio Perez. And at the start line in Montreal, Leclerc will be watching Verstappen through a sea of traffic having been consigned to the back of the grid and penalised for using too many power-unit components. What\u2019s Monegasque for sacr\u00e9 bleu? Lewis Hamilton, who spent the week being treated for back injuries sustained from all that bouncing on the Baku straights, comes into the race after his best qualifying of the season so far \u2013 though his hopes of troubling Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull from fourth are slim indeed. Alongside Verstappen in the front row will be Fernando Alonso, 40 years young, who rolled back the years in qualifying, jinxing around a wet track and power-sliding his Alpine out of the last corner to cap a majestic lap. And the Spaniard has made no secret of disguising his plans for today. \u201cThe goal is to lead the race in lap one,\u201d he says. \u201cTurn one: maximum attack.\u201d  It should be good. Strap in. Lights out at 19:00 BST.  "

                    "body": "  8.03am   What we learned, Wednesday 23 November  The undisputed world champion, Amy Remeikis, will be back tomorrow morning. Here are the main stories today on Wednesday 23 November:  Coalition MP Bridget Archer flags crossing the floor again as debate continues on the national integrity commission bill. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, withdraws a \u201ccoward\u201d comment aimed at LNP senator Gerard Rennick. \u201cIt is traumatic\u201d: Liberal MP Karen Andrews tears up during emotional speech on domestic violence. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, meets the Chinese defence minister at a regional summit and stresses the importance of maintaining lines of communication between their militaries. The prime minister of Finland, Sanna Marin, will visit Australia next week, in the first visit to the country by a Finnish PM. Independent MP Monique Ryan and the Greens announce they will renew a push to lower the voting age in Australia in the new year. The Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Dr Philip Lowe, says any inflation response must not include equivalent wage rises.  We will see you again for more news on Thursday.  Updated at 8.19am GMT    8.00am   Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin to visit Australia  Anthony Albanese will welcome his Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, to Australia next week. Marin, who was cleared of misconduct earlier this month after footage circulated of her basically having a good time, will be the first Finnish prime minister to visit Australia. Marin will be accompanied by a business delegation and will also address the Lowy Institute, Albanese\u2019s office confirmed in a statement. The statement went on to say that Australia and Finland share a \u201ccommon vision\u201d based on equality, trust and shared values, the pair work closely in multilateral forums and Finland has been a strong supporter of Australia\u2019s bid to finalise a free trade agreement with the European Union. Finland is also seeking Nato membership in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Albanese said:  I look forward to welcoming prime minister Marin to Australia on Friday. Although a world apart geographically, Australia and Finland are united by shared values and a strong desire to uphold the international rules-based order. Australians and Finns have a mutual appreciation for fostering sustainable growth, investing in clean energy and resilient supply chains and social and political stability.    Updated at 8.13am GMT    7.33am    Minister open to talks with China \u2018any time\u2019 on trade bans The trade minister, Don Farrell, has declared he is ready to meet his Chinese counterpart at any time, saying he is increasingly confident the two countries can resolve their trade dispute without having to pursue rulings via the World Trade Organisation. Farrell said he was an optimist and was hopeful that the trade issues could be sorted out by negotiation and discussion. Speaking to reporters at Parliament House this afternoon, the minister said the government would not be withdrawing its two WTO challenges \u2013 one relating to China\u2019s tariffs on Australian wine and the other on the barley tariffs. But he added:  The offer is there to the Chinese government to start discussions with us about lifting those [trade] bans. And we\u2019re happy to do that at any time.  Farrell said Anthony Albanese\u2019s meeting with Xi Jinping in Bali last week give him confidence that Australia could improve the state of its relationship with its largest trading partner:  Given the, I guess you might call it, the triumph of diplomacy last week between prime minister Albanese and the Chinese president, I\u2019m confident that we can stabilise our relationship, and that through discussion we can resolve our outstanding trade blockages without having to proceed with matters in the World Trade Organisation.  The opposition has said any dialogue with China \u2013 including yesterday\u2019s meeting between the two countries\u2019 defence ministers \u2013 will ultimately be judged on whether it delivers results for Australia.  Updated at 7.48am GMT    7.28am   Bridget Archer flags supporting crossbench amendments  Hello from Canberra. Debate on the national integrity commission is continuing in the House of Representatives tonight. The Liberal backbencher Bridget Archer (readers may remember Archer as the government MP who crossed the floor in the last parliament to bring on debate about Helen Haines\u2019 proposal for an anti-corruption commission \u2013 a gutsy act that caused a massive internal stink at the time) has just flagged another demonstration of independence when this debate gets to the pointy end. Archer has just flagged supporting cross-bench amendments removing \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as the test for whether or not there are public hearings, and replacing that threshold with a public interest test. She\u2019s backed an extension of protections for whistleblowers, and Archer has also argued if the government of the day departs from the recommendations of a parliamentary committee overseeing the new integrity body, the government should provide reasons for that departure. This won\u2019t make a difference to the final outcome on current indications because Labor has the numbers with the bulk of the Coalition to make exceptional circumstances the legislated test for public hearings \u2013 but Archer is remaining true to the spirit of her floor crossing one year ago. She\u2019s very clear she wants this bill to pass as a downpayment on restoring public trust in politics. She\u2019s also had a flick at Scott Morrison on the way through, noting she has long been of the view that voters want a federal anti-corruption commission unlike some colleagues who dismissed the idea as a \u201cfringe issue\u201d. Fringe issue was a Morrison characterisation. Archer said:  As elected officials, we cannot take any trust that we do have for granted, and nor should we ever believe or act as though we are above reproach. We must do everything that we can with the power and privilege that we hold in this House to build back the trust that has eroded over time, and as the only jurisdiction in Australia without an integrity commission, this is long overdue.   Updated at 7.29am GMT    7.08am    Latrobe Valley Excess:   Updated at 7.12am GMT    7.00am    Scott Morrison, Christian Porter, Alan Tudge, Stuart Robert, Michael Keenan and Marise Payne have received approval for taxpayer-funded legal expenses related to the robodebt royal commission. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has approved the expenses for the six former ministers, who all held portfolios in government, social or human services at the centre of the inquiry into the federal government\u2019s unlawful use of income averaging to demand welfare repayments. The revelation comes as the commission confirms it is to investigate how former Coalition government ministers and top public servants established the program through the federal budget process. The full story by Paul Karp and Luke Henriques-Gomes is here:      6.44am    Australia\u2019s former race commissioner Tim Soutphommasane has urged the Australian Public Service Commission \u201cto get its act together on cultural diversity\u201d. He says that despite the commission saying that there had been a gradual but steady increase in the past two decades of those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds working in the public service, its own figures showed no improvement since 2013. \u201cReform is long overdue,\u201d Soutphommasane tweeted.   Updated at 6.45am GMT    6.23am    The Senate appears set to pass landmark laws to abolish bans on the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory making their own laws on euthanasia, with a potential late-night sitting session next week likely to overturn the 16-year-old federal bar. Close to half the Senate has already declared its support for the change, with more support from new senators expected to see the bill pass. Luke Gosling, member for the NT electorate of Solomon and one of the MPs who introduced the bill into the lower house, said he was confident of success. Gosling told the ABC:  I think we\u2019ve been able to convince the majority of senators that we deserve to have our own rights and it\u2019s not up to someone from New South Wales, Victoria or anywhere else to decide these issues. They\u2019re for Territorians to decide.  You can read more on this story here:      6.12am    The always excellent Afternoon Update newsletter is live:       6.07am    The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, has attacked the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, in the federation chamber for the \u201cunprecedented action in discontinuing proceedings against Mr [Bernard] Collaery for security related offences\u201d. Collaery was up for five criminal charges related to handling of information about his client Witness K blowing the whistle on Australia\u2019s alleged spying on East Timor, before Dreyfus discontinued the matter. In the federation chamber, Leeser referred to comments from the commonwealth director of public prosecutions that the prosecution was \u201cbased on public interest\u201d and questioned what changed after Labor was elected. Leeser then asked:  What message does this send to people who might deal in Australia secrets? Why has the attorney general chosen to intervene in this matter, and not matters involving other whistleblowers? Was it because Mr Collaery was an attorney general in the ACT Labor government?  One problem with that: Collaery was not AG in a Labor government. In the first territory parliament, power changed hands a few times. Collaery was AG from December 1989 to May 1991 under Liberal chief minister Trevor Kaine. Oops. Dreyfus said the decision \u201creflects the government\u2019s commitment to our national security and our commitment to our relations with our neighbours\u201d. \u201cThe government remains absolutely steadfast in our commitment to keep Australians safe by keeping secrets out of the wrong hands,\u201d he said.  Updated at 6.16am GMT    5.54am    Federal government will push states to release secret report on raising age of criminal responsibility  The federal government will encourage all state and territory attorneys general to agree to release a secret report on raising the age of criminal responsibility. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told parliament the 2020 report was authorised by the Western Australian government and was the product of the former meeting of the country\u2019s attorneys general \u201cso there are steps that have to be taken in order for it to be released\u201d. Responding to a question from the independent MP Kate Chaney, Dreyfus said:  I have instructed my department to include the release of the paper as an item for decision at the next meeting of the standing council of attorneys general which met for the first time on 12 August this year \u2026 The next meeting will be in December 2022.  Another government minister, Murray Watt, told the Senate today that the federal government wants \u201cto put pressure on the states\u201d to raise the age of criminal responsibility. Watt said:  As a country we haven\u2019t done a good enough job around youth justice for young Indigenous people and they are being incarcerated at a far higher rate than should be acceptable to any of us in this country.  During Senate question time, Watt also responded to a question from the Greens senator Lidia Thorpe about racist attacks on First Nations children. Watt told the Senate:  We don\u2019t want to see First Nations people exposed to the kind of violence that we have seen of late. And all I can do is repeat the fact that I think we all found that disturbing and we need to do much better as a country.

The site appears to have disappeared between Monday and Tuesday, Australian time, and has not returned since. The file server where leaked Medibank files were linked from the blog has remained online. On Sunday, the hacker group \u2013 which authorities have linked to Russia and which is believed to be connected to the REvil ransomware organisation \u2013 posted 1,500 records related to claims on chronic conditions such as heart disease, as well as the patient details of people with cancer, dementia, mental health conditions and infections.

Daniel Andrews, the nation\u2019s longest serving incumbent leader, is seeking a third four-year term against the Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, who took the Coalition to a devastating loss in 2018. But the big policy differences between the major parties \u2013 the opposition\u2019s pledge to shelve the Suburban Rail Loop project to help fund the healthcare system and Labor\u2019s vow to revitalise a state-owned electricity corporation \u2013 have become overshadowed by personal attacks in what has increasingly become a vicious campaign.

The committee found Australia must do more to protect Aboriginal cultural heritage by overhauling \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d laws and giving traditional owners the \u201cright to withhold consent\u201d over developments on their country.

Updated at 5.20am GMT    4.58am    Robodebt inquiry to begin investigating former Coalition ministers\u2019 roles in creating program The robodebt royal commission scheme is set to investigate how former Coalition government ministers and top public servants established the program through the federal budget process. It is one of several topics to be explored in a two-week block of hearings commencing on 5 December, according to a media statement released by the commission on Wednesday. The royal commission said the focus of those hearings would include the impacts of the scheme on individuals and the experience of representative bodies and the government\u2019s response to identified shortcomings in the scheme. Other issues to be investigated include the role played by the budget process in establishing the scheme, including the involvement of portfolio ministers and top public service executives in this process. Former ministers with responsibility over the period include but are not limited to Scott Morrison, Christian Porter, Marise Payne, Alan Tudge, and Stuart Robert. An initial set of hearings this month have already started to explore whether legal warnings about the scheme reached Morrison and Payne, who were social services and human services ministers when the program was devised. The inquiry also heard that Morrison\u2019s support for a ramp-up of Centrelink debt recovery saw lawyers rushed into providing advice on plans for the program. The next hearings will also look at the investigation undertaken by the commonwealth ombudsman. That 2017 investigation went on to green light the scheme\u2019s legality, much to the dismay of critics of the program at the time.  Updated at 5.07am GMT    4.55am    Doctors criticise Victorian government\u2019s plan to give pharmacists prescription powers It seems doctors aren\u2019t too thrilled with Daniel Andrews\u2019s election announcement that pharmacists would be able to treat minor health issues, like UTIs, as AAP reports: The Australian Medical Association\u2019s vice-president, Dr Danielle McMullen, described it as a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to general practitioners, saying antibiotic resistance was one of the biggest health threats facing the world so she did not support any program which increased prescribing. \u201cIt does put antimicrobial resistance at risk, it puts women on the pill at risk,\u201d Dr McMullen told AAP. She said common conditions like migraines and even smoking can affect the safety of the pill so it was vital women saw a GP for a refill every one or two years. \u201cPrescribing medication is more than just clicking \u2018print\u2019; for every prescription that we write, it really is a consideration of that person\u2019s whole healthcare picture.\u201d Allowing pharmacists to prescribe medication was \u201ca step in the wrong direction,\u201d according to Royal Australian College of General Practitioners President adjunct professor Karen Price. She said a similar trial in Queensland resulted in a pharmacist giving a patient in their 50s antibiotics for a presumed UTI when they actually had a 15cm mass in their pelvis. \u201cOverseas in the United Kingdom the British pharmacists\u2019 own defence union warned of incidents of unsafe practice that have emerged with the rise of independent pharmacist prescribers,\u201d Price said. Under the pilot, the government would pay pharmacists $20 per consultation and patients would pay no more than the current Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment for any medications required.  Updated at 5.03am GMT    4.44am    Guy Debelle, the chief financial officer of Fortescue Future Industries is still recovering from a serious bike accident and has had to step away from the role while he focusses on his recovery. Debelle is a former deputy governor of the RBA, who many thought would be taking Philip Lowe\u2019s place. Here is the announcement:  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (Fortescue, ASX: FMG) today advises that Dr Guy Debelle will transition from the role of Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to the Board of FFI Australia to focus on his health. Felicity Gooding has been appointed Acting CFO of FFI. In August 2022, Dr Debelle was involved in a serious bicycle incident. Over the past few months, he has been recovering, while managing the demanding duties associated with his role as CFO, and has made the difficult decision to step back to be able to focus on his health. In his new role, Dr Debelle will focus on policy, regulatory and financial advisory, including the development of theAustralian green energy market. Fortescue Founder and Executive Chairman, Dr Andrew Forrest AO said, \u201cGuy is an outstanding human being who also happens to be one of the brightest economic minds in this country. He is passionate about climate change action and deeply committed to making a difference. \u201cGuy\u2019s recovery has been tough and is still ongoing. He has decided, with my full support and with the support of the Fortescue Family, to stand down from this role and transition to a role on the FFI Board so he can fully focus on his recovery. \u201cGuy has made an enormous contribution to FFI with his extensive economic credibility through his many years at the Reserve Bank of Australia. We are very fortunate that he will remain part of the Fortescue Family in his new position, as we continue our transition to a global green energy, technology and resources company.\u201d Dr Debelle said, \u201cThis has been a difficult decision. I am sadly not in a position to give this role everything I know it deserves right now. It is a critical time for the green energy transition, and we cannot slow down. I have felt deeply supported by Andrew and Mark. I greatly admire this Company and what FFI and Fortescue are doing and achieving. Thank you to the incredible team at FFI.\u201d   Updated at 4.55am GMT    4.39am    New Zealand headed for recession in 2023 Speaking of New Zealand, it looks set for some tough times next year, AAP reports: New Zealand is bound for recession next year according to its central bank, which delivered an eye-watering forecasts and an unprecedented triple-hike of the official cash rate, raising it by 75 basis points to 4.25%. On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted rates for the ninth consecutive meeting and upped the predicted OCR peak to 5.5%. The RBNZ\u2019s latest projections suggest pain for Kiwi mortgage-holders, with inflation staying doggedly outside the target band until late 2024. The bank\u2019s inflation-fighting course will deliver New Zealand a recession beginning in Q2 next year, with four quarters of mild contractions before two further quarters of zero growth. The RBNZ governor, Adrian Orr, admitted the cash rate needed to go higher than it previously forecast, and quicker than first thought, to fight runaway inflation currently at 7.2%. \u201cInflation is no one\u2019s friend,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to rid the country of inflation we need to reduce spending levels. That means that we will have a period of negative GDP growth, we think to the tune of around 1% of GDP.\u201d Showing the scale of the inflation challenge, the RBNZ\u2019s last forecasts, issued in August, suggested an OCR peak of 4.1%.  Three months on, it has already outstripped that forecast, with further rate rises baked in early next year.  Updated at 4.50am GMT    4.37am    Resettlement of refugees from offshore detention \u2018a hard-earned win for human rights\u2019: Amnesty International Amnesty International has welcomed the start of the resettlement of asylum seekers from Australia\u2019s detention program in New Zealand. Executive Director at Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand, Shaun Greaves, said he hoped it was just the start:  This is a hard-earned win for human rights. Our heartfelt thanks go to the thousands of advocates around the world who pushed for this to happen, and to all those who have shared their lived experience of the dire conditions in Australia\u2019s detention regime. Sometimes injustices seem insurmountable, but standing together will bring us closer to a world based on aroha, equality and care. The dire conditions experienced in offshore detention centres have caused serious mental and physical health issues for many people. The New Zealand government must now do all that it can to support all those arriving in Aotearoa to settle into a flourishing life.   Updated at 4.46am GMT    4.20am    Australian scientists sequence Hass avocado genome Hot off the heels of golden wattle DNA being decoded, scientists have sequenced the genome of the Hass avocado. It\u2019s a development researchers hope may shed light on the plant\u2019s biology and the fats and sugars in the avocado fruit. Dr Onkar Nath of the University of Queensland, said in a statement:  Our Hass genome is 98% complete \u2013 the first in the world of such complexity \u2013 and we now know which genes are responsible for which characteristic \u2026  Avocado already tastes very good, but there is still scope for improvement for many useful characteristics such as tree height, architecture and resistance to pests and diseases. The research, published in the journal Horticultural Research, identified 48,915 avocado genes, of which 39,207 could be ascribed specific functions.  Updated at 4.36am GMT    4.19am    Cybersecurity centre publishes guide to data vulnerability tipoffs for organisations  In the wake of high-profile data breaches, the government\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre has published a guide for organisations to set up a vulnerability disclosure program. Basically, businesses should make it easier for insiders and outsiders to tip off those businesses about the discovery of any security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, and any such tip off should be acted on immediately and the person who discovered it thanked. The guide can be found here. The minister for home affairs and cybersecurity, Clare O\u2019Neil, said in a statement organisations should arm themselves against cybercriminals:  I know many Australians are still reeling from data breaches where their private and very personal data was stolen and published online. What we can learn from hacks is that it\u2019s vital we need to strengthen our cyber defences. And we need to do that now \u2026 Australia can be the most cybersecure country in the world. But we need to work together. We need to identify and close off any security vulnerabilities and uplift our cybersecurity posture. I implore all Australian organisations to go to cyber.gov.au and download this publication and put in place a vulnerability disclosure program.   Updated at 4.35am GMT    4.18am   Penny Wong withdraws 'coward' comment in Senate aimed at Gerard Rennick  There have been some heated exchanges in Senate question time. The Liberal National party senator Gerard Rennick (who denies mainstream climate science) interjected during a question about the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology state of the climate report. His comments couldn\u2019t clearly be heard. The government\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, told Rennick:  Stand up and say it.  The Senate president, Sue Lines, asked Wong to withdraw one of the comments she made. Wong asked for clarity:  That he\u2019s a coward?  Lines told Wong it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d to repeat a comment to be withdrawn. Wong then said without qualification:  I withdraw.   Updated at 4.30am GMT    4.15am    And question time ends. Don\u2019t get too excited, though. There is another one tomorrow.  Updated at 4.27am GMT    4.15am    Andrew Wallace to Anthony Albanese:  Prime minister, the Alex Surf Life Saving Club of which I\u2019m a proud member on the beautiful Sunshine Coast will be forced to pay $250,000 more for electricity next year compared to this year. When can the Alex Surf Life Saving Club see the promised $275 cut to their power bills?  Two things: one, the Alex surf club sits on absolute mint beachfront land on the Alexandra Headlands. It also has a very large membership. It is not exactly a small club. Two, the Labor election policy for the $275 cut was by 2025. Yes, Labor isn\u2019t repeating it, but the commitment was by 2025. Albanese:  I will just start very quickly by giving a shout out to the Alex Surf Life Saving Club. I was very pleased to be there and to meet the heads of the Alex Surf Life Saving Club, and \u2026  [Someone from the opposition yells something about Maroochydore] \u2026 No, I was at Alexandra Heads Surf Life Saving Club and we did a press conference there. See, I know Queensland. Alexandra Heads is different from Maroochydore. Two different events two different places, a bit like the effort in Yeppoon \u2013 two different places.  He then asks Chris Bowen to take the question.  We are very concerned about the impact on energy prices of the global energy crisis, caused by the war in Ukraine.  \u2026 [Angus Taylor] had a different view prior to the election. He had a different view prior to the election. Prior to the election, he was asked about Ukraine and what does it mean for the world\u2019s gas supply, and the member for Hume said: \u201cWell, obviously, it is putting upward pressure on oil and gas prices around the world.\u201d  Mr Speaker, that\u2019s what he said. We also had the other energy minister in the government who said: \u201cBut in the last 12 months we\u2019ve seen Russia invade Ukraine and to think that is not going to have an impact, particularly on our supply chains, that would be unfair.\u201d  That was also the other energy minister, who was also prime minister and member for Cook, and I\u2019m not sure what capacity he was talking in, but he was actually correct. We understand the impact on the surf life saving club, we understand the impact on industry, and that\u2019s why we will not stand by and watch this play out. We will not stand by and watch the fact that thermal coal was selling at $286 a tonne in December \u201821 and now selling at $515 a tonne, Mr Speaker. That will flow through unless the government takes action. Gas was selling for $11.56 a gigajoule in December. Today it is $18.67. This is what is driving the energy price rises, as the International Energy Agency has made clear right around the world, Mr Speaker.  \u2026 Governments all around the world are dealing with this crisis and responding, just as this government is working through the issues and will respond and will not stand by and let this impact on Australian households and businesses.   Updated at 4.27am GMT    4.05am    Dai Le, the independent MP for Fowler, has the third crossbench question:  I\u2019m sure that residents in Fowler, Western Sydney and across Australia are awaiting their electricity bills with trepidation. With Christmas about four weeks away, families are feeling the pinch as they spend more on food, petrol which has increased and household bills on top of buying presents for their loved ones. You have said that you will announce \u201csensible energy to this crisis.\u201d What is the date?  Jim Chalmers:  Thank you very much to the member for Fowler for her question and for her interest and obviously for the way that she is engaged on these issues for some time now.  The reason that we are prepared to make that temporary, meaningful, responsible intervention in these markets between now and the end of the year is because we do think it is unacceptable, the sorts of price rises which are anticipated by the Treasury, and contained in the Budget Papers that I released about a month ago.  The Australian people are paying a very hefty price for the Russian war in Ukraine and for a decade of incompetence when it comes to energy markets and the reality is... The failures of the member for Hume and others on that side of the House means that we are more vulnerable to these international shocks in global energy markets than we should be and that is because over the course of a decade, those opposite took more capacity out of the energy markets than they put in and that made us more vulnerable. That\u2019s how we find ourselves in the position that we are. That\u2019s how we find ourselves in the position that we are in and it is unacceptable. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working closely with the resources Minister, the Energy Minister, the Trade Minister, the Prime Minister and others to find a way to intervene in these markets in a meaningful way n a temporary way and in a responsible way. And to those\u2026  Le is back on her feet.  Treasurer, I just want a date, if it\u2019s possible.  There are cheers from the opposition side of the chamber. Chalmers continues:  We will progress this work as quickly as we can and we will make an announcement before the end of the year.      4.01am    Chris Bowen: Opposition should explain to Pacific \u2018why our country should have no role in helping\u2019 the region in climate crisis The Liberal MP for Herbert, Phil Thompson, is the opposition MP charged with asking the dog-whistling question today:  Before the election, Labor promised to reduce power prices on at least 97 occasions. But before the election, Labor was completely silent about signing us up to a $2 trillion UN fund to send money to countries all around the world. Why is the government sending taxpayers\u2019 money offshore while taking no action to reduce power bills of struggling Australian families?  Chris Bowen (who has one of these a week, kicked off by Peter Dutton on Monday):  There is a lot in that question, and a lot I could talk about, but I will deal with the latter part of the honourable member\u2019s question, because on this side of the house we do believe in engaging on how to deal with the impacts of climate change here and around the world. That\u2019s what we believe in. We believe in doing that domestically and internationally. That\u2019s what we were doing last week at the Cop27 meeting. We believe this is an important security in this region as well, in south-east Asia. There is a difference of view, it appears, between the government and opposition on this question. We believe in engaging in the international conversation. We believe in shaping that conversation. That\u2019s what we were doing last week \u2013 negotiating, talking to the Pacific, talking to developed countries, talking about good design, talking about ensuring that wealthy countries that weren\u2019t wealthy in 1992 are making a contribution, making sure that the loss and damage payments are focused on the most vulnerable countries, countries in our region, countries in our region like Tuvalu and Vanuatu and Samoa. That\u2019s what we believe. Countries like Fiji, which is estimated to lose 5% of their GDP every year due to climate change-induced natural disasters, have a right to a seat at the table. We believe it is in our interests to engage with them. And if the opposition has an alternative view, I invite them to outline it. They say this is not a conversation we should be involved in. They say we should not be talking at the Cop and not talking to specific nations. I invite the leader of the opposition on this topic. He is the alternative prime minister of this country. If he is successful, it will be his role to be the chief diplomat of the nation, Mr Speaker. I invite him today to invite the high commissioners and ambassadors of the Pacific to hear why he thinks they should not be, why our country should have no role in helping the Pacific. To [add] a few jokes to his discourse about and he should explain it. He should explain to the Pakistani community, which I met with, the Pakistani leaders about the $30 billion worth of damage to their economy. He should explain that is not our concern. We have no interest in this matter. This is his role, this is his approach, he should explain it to the Australian people.  Our view is clear: We will engage, we will be involved, we will be constructive in climate debate because Australia is back at the table after 10 long years.   Updated at 4.20am GMT    3.56am    After not getting opposition questions on the IR bill, Tony Burke has someone from the government ask him one.     3.53am    Kate Chaney has another of the crossbench questions for the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on the age of criminal responsibility and calls to raise the age:  The UN has expressed concern about the very low age of criminal responsibility in Australia. In WA, we are currently locking kids up in an adult prison. Will you make public the final report prepared in 2020 by the council of attorneys general that allegedly shows the majority of state and territory attorneys general were in favour of raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years?  Dreyfus:  The report that the member has mentioned, a report authorised by the West Australian government, was the product of the former meeting of attorneys general. Sorry for making the precise distinction. The decision not to release it was made under the previous government. The paper was not written by the commonwealth government, so there are steps that have to be taken in order for it to be released. I have instructed my department to include the release of the paper as an item for decision at the next meeting of the standing council of attorneys general which met for the first time on 12 August this year. \u2026 I do appreciate the member\u2019s interest in respect of the minimum age of criminal responsibility. I am working to develop proposals about the minimum age of criminal responsibility.  I\u2019m also working closely with the minister for Indigenous Australians to address the very serious issue of overrepresentation of First Nations children in the criminal justice system, consistent with the obligations of all governments under the national agreement on closing the gap.  At that meeting on 12 August, all attorneys general agreed that an official working group will continue to develop to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility, paying particular attention to that overrepresentation of First Nations children. The next meeting will be in December 2022. I note that some progress in this has already been made because the government of the Northern Territory has introduced a bill already, and there is now a bill before the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory to raise the age of criminal responsibility.   Updated at 4.11am GMT    3.52am    Now it is Mark Coulton\u2019s time (the Coalition MP for Parkes). He has one for Catherine King:  I refer to warnings by domestic airlines that that they\u2019ll be forced to cut marginal fair cuts and increase prices as a result of the government\u2019s extreme regional industrial changes, given families rely on these being accessible and affordable can the minister guarantee there\u2019ll be no impacts to regional routes from Labor\u2019s extreme industrial relations agenda?  Seems like no one actually wants to ask Tony Burke a question on this legislation, but wants to ask everyone else about it. King:  I\u2019ll start answering the question and then I will ask the minister for industrial relations, who\u2019s responsible both for the legislation and the same job same pay policy, which in fact I suspect the member was referring to.  It has been terrific to see our airlines come back at strength. We\u2019re almost seeing 100% of domestic demand coming back. That\u2019s very pleasing to see.  I do note that Qantas has become very profitable and, had the previous government done what we suggested and actually provide JobKeeper with equity stake in Qantas, we\u2019d be making quite a bit of money at the moment, it might have been something that would have been a very good idea.  But I am conscious that Qantas is in the building lobbying, as are a number of other businesses, at the moment. And can I assure you our interest is getting wages moving and making sure that the services that are delivered right the way across the country and the wages of regional people are actually benefiting from our industrial relations legislation.  Tony Burke gets up:  I don\u2019t know what someone has to do to get a question in this place. The portfolio appears to be of interest. But I don\u2019t know what it is, I don\u2019t know what it would take for those opposite to realise that it\u2019s not outrageous for the Australian workforce to want a share of profits that happen in Australia. It\u2019s not outrageous for the Australian workforce to see projects, see businesses, in Australia doing well and saying at the same time why should they be constantly falling behind? There\u2019s nothing wrong with the Australian workforce believing that they should have a better chance of keeping up with what\u2019s lapping in expenses in this country. \u2026 One of the words that was used in the question was the word extreme. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s extreme. Ten years of wages not moving is extreme. Ten years of Australians going further and further behind. That\u2019s extreme. Australian workers \u2026 now, in real terms, earning less than what they were earning a decade ago.  That\u2019s extreme. But that wasn\u2019t an accident. That was a deliberate design feature of those opposite economy. They\u2019re on to it. They know the legislation will deal with it. Because the shadow treasurer\u2019s objection to the legislation is because it will get wages moving That\u2019s his objection to it. I\u2019ll tell you what I want with flight routes. I want more Australians to be able to afford to get on a plane. I want more Australians to be able to afford some of those discretionary expenses. Those opposite know the title of the bill is what it will deliver and that\u2019s what they oppose. They oppose secure jobs, they oppose better pay. We intend to deliver both.   Updated at 4.07am GMT    3.42am    Chris Bowen takes a dixer on climate action, and includes this in his answer:  I\u2019m pleased to report to the house, for example, that today the other place, the Senate, has passed the final piece of legislation necessary for offshore wind in Australia, the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle. And I look forward to making further announcements about offshore wind in coming weeks. Very important announcement.  I\u2019m confident the Senate will pass the electric vehicle tax cut this week. No support from the opposition for that, such is their prejudice, but other parties have worked with the government and we will pass that important legislation and electric vehicles will be cheaper for people around the country. This is what we\u2019re doing, getting on with the job. I\u2019m also pleased to report my friendly assistant treasurer has introduced the tax laws amendment bill which will [provide] the funds for rewiring the nation, improving transmission across the country, build the transmission we need to get renewable energy on.  These are important steps that are necessary and vital, as we know, for Australia to act. I\u2019m pleased to inform the house that next Thursday on behalf of the government I\u2019ll be delivering the nation\u2019s first climate change statement as required under the act we passed, the first time an act was passed in a decade. This is what transparency is about. This is what progress is about. Reporting to the house on progress, reporting to the house on challenges, reporting to the house on opportunities. I hope the house comes together at that time so we can all share policies on climate change that are necessary in this country.   Updated at 3.59am GMT    3.38am    Jim Chalmers gets a dixer and then it is back to Jenny Ware! Who is in the right seat! What a time.  I refer to page 52 of the Regulation Impact Statement from the fair work amendment bill. In calculating the cost of multi-employer bargaining, the report states, \u2018The $275,700 divided by 15.2 is $12,878 per business. Is the minister aware that figure divided by 15.2 equals $18,006 of is this a mistake the government is deliberately trying to hide the significant costs which businesses are set to pay?  Milton Dick sighs louder than my mum did every time the issue of my curfew came up when I was a teenager.  I\u2019m going to give the call to the minister. There was a question in there relating to her portfolio. I give her the call.  Julie Collins:  I do thank the member for her question. As she would be aware, regulatory impact statements are prepared by the department responsible for that legislation. That department is the Department of Workplace Relations, and the minister responsible is over here if you want to direct the question to him.   Updated at 3.41am GMT    3.33am    Tony Burke gets up and asks:  It\u2019s on a different point of order. Is the member for Hughes even in her correct seat? That she\u2019d have to be in, to be able to get the call?  (Under the standing orders, members must be in their correct seats.) IS JENNY WARE EVEN IN THE RIGHT SEAT? What a moment in the parliament. Peter Dutton is INCENSED.  To assist you, Mr Speaker, I have not heard a more petty point of order made in this place.  The house is full of interjections. Everyone has something to say. Dutton continues:  With respect to you, Mr Speaker, you have chosen to give the member the call. That can\u2019t be overruled by now some post-facto advice from the leader of the house.  (Ware was not in her correct seat, it seems.) Dick has had enough (and so have I, because every minute in question time is like staring into the abyss and having it stare back at you, and no one\u2019s soul can withstand that much beigeness) Dick:  To assist the house, I would remind all members to reside in their seat as per the standing orders. I am going to move to the next question and will come back to the member for Hughes.  We finally move on.  Updated at 3.44am GMT    3.29am    The member for Hughes, Jenny Ware, has a question for \u2026 you guessed it, Julie Collins! Ware:  Can the minister advise whether there is an error in the industrial relations regulatory impact statement? And, if so, can the minister advise of the correct figure?  Tony Burke is immediately on his feet to say that this isn\u2019t in Julie Collins\u2019s portfolio. Peter Dutton then steps in:  Mr Speaker, with real respect for my colleague opposite, I think he\u2019s playing a little cute on this one. This issue has been quite contentious in the Senate already. Whether he\u2019s conveyed that message or not, I\u2019d be very surprised if he hasn\u2019t.  The fact is the question was put to the Minister for Small Business. It relates to the provision within the regulatory impact statement that goes to small business impact, 15,000, medium-sized, large-sized business. There was an obvious mistake the minister should be aware of and she should \u2026[answer the question]  Burke then seizes on that:  Mr Speaker, to the point of order raised by the leader of the opposition. He actually just gave the game away. He actually said, \u201cEven if you add all the extra context it\u2019s about a medium-sized question, not about the small business minister.\u2019 So even if we accept everything he\u2019s just said they\u2019ve still got it wrong. They\u2019ve still got it wrong. So there is no way in the world that question is a valid question in the way they\u2019ve tried to direct it.  And then Peter Dutton is back:  Mr Speaker, is the argument now that the small business minister can\u2019t answer a question in relation to medium-sized businesses that the argument being put by the leader of the house? I mean, how long does this protection racket continue on for?  Milton Dick wants the question repeated for the benefit of the house. There are so many interjections that it is hard to say who is speaking. And then Anthony Albanese gets up:  Past Speakers have, at this embarrassing point, just asked to move on. We should move on to the next question until there\u2019s a member on this side to do so.  Dick asks for the question to be reread. It is. And then Dick makes his ruling.  I\u2019m going to rule the question out of order. She\u2019s got time to rephrase it so it\u2019s directed either to the right minister or including the right information, OK?  But Dutton is not happy.  In my submission to you, Mr Speaker, I can\u2019t believe that you can rule the question out of order \u2026 Regulatory impact statement relates to small business. That\u2019s the section that is being referred to. So for your information, Mr Speaker, it\u2019s not beyond the remit of the minister, in fact, it\u2019s entirely within her portfolio responsibility.  And then \u2026 see next post.  Updated at 3.46am GMT    3.17am    Attorney general says bill on whistleblower law reform to be introduced The independent MP for Mackellar, Dr Sophie Scamps, is up first for the crossbench:  The persecution and prosecution of [whistleblowers] is a national shame. Today Griffith University, the Human Rights Law Centre and transparency international have released a report outlining 12 key steps Australia must take to strengthen whistleblower protections. Will the government commit to implementing the report\u2019s recommendations in this term of parliament, in particular the establishment of the whistleblower protection authority?  Mark Dreyfus:  I have received a copy of the joint report on whistleblowers by Griffith university, the Human Rights Law Centre and Transparency International and I know of the member\u2019s longstanding interest in this area. The report sets out a number of areas of whistleblower reform. It will be considered by the government along with other reviews, and reports on this important topic. I have previously indicated pretty clearly that the Albanese government is going to deliver long overdue reforms to the public interest disclosure act to ensure that Australia has best practice whistleblowing protection for the public sector. Next week I will be introducing to the parliament a bill which will implement the key recommendations, and this is long overdue, of the 2016 review of the Public Interest Disclosure Act that was carried out by an eminent Australian public servant, Mr Philip Moss AM, and it will also be implementing some parliamentary committee reports which have looked at the operation of the public interest disclosure act since we brought it to government when we were last in government in 2013. The bill that I\u2019m introducing next week will deliver some immediate improvements to the public sector whistleblowing scheme. It will be in place before the national anti-corruption commission commences, as we hope, in mid-2023, and this bill will represent the first stage of a significant package of public sector whistleblowing reform. Following the passage of that bill, this first bill, the government will commence a second stage of further and broader reforms to the public interest disclosure act which will include an exposure draft process, a discussion paper on whether there is a need to establish a whistleblower protection or as some of your crossbench colleagues have suggested a whistleblower protection commission. The bill that\u2019s going to be introduced next week and the Albanese government\u2019s broader reform package reinforces our strong commitment to restoring integrity in government and the rule of law.   Updated at 3.38am GMT    3.15am    The dixers have been about the passing of Labor\u2019s cheaper childcare legislation through the Senate. It doesn\u2019t come into effect until next year, but will make early childhood education cheaper for most Australian families once it is in place. Next up \u2013 paying the workforce more and securing enough workers for the sector.  Updated at 3.26am GMT    3.11am    The Liberal MP Angie Bell has a question for Julie Collins (it is looking like the Collins hour once again):  Minister, under the IR legislation, a coffee shop with less than 15 employees is exempt from compulsory bargaining. If a coffee shop operates over three sites with 7 employees at each will they be forced into multi-employer bargaining?  Collins:  As I said very clearly, there are measures that need to be met. The single employer needs to have the businesses of the number of threshold of employees. We are currently negotiating and discussing given the Senate recommendations on that number of employees. We have also said that either side of the bargaining table can opt in to the single interest bargaining stream. The employer by consent or the employees by majority support. They also need to meet the test whereby the Fair Work Commission needs to be satisfied that the employers have clearly identified common interests and the bargaining is not contrary to the public interest. There are several thresholds that need to be met. The employee number, as you would know, from the recommendations from the Senate there is another number that has been proposed and we\u2019re currently in negotiations and discussing that. But let\u2019s be very clear. Over 2 million small businesses in Australia will be exempt from these provisions.  Collins reads most of this answer.  Updated at 3.23am GMT    3.08am   Question time begins  We are straight into it again today, with Sussan Ley asking Julie Collins: Under Labor\u2019s industrial relations agenda which the minister has confirmed not a single small business in this country supports, a coffee shop with less than 15 employees is exempt from compulsory multi-employer bargaining. If that small business operates over three sites with 7 employees at each, can that small business be compelled into multi-employer bargaining? Collins:  As I have said in this place we are continuing to consult and talk to small businesses as we negotiate getting the industrial relations legislation through this Parliament. When it comes to the size of small business, she would have seen the recommendations from the Senate committee yesterday. We\u2019re having a look at those. We are actually talking to people about what they might mean. Indeed, as she would also know if she\u2019s read the bill, there are several thresholds that need to be met for the single interest bargaining scheme. One is the number of employees. Of course the others are that the Fair Work Commission needs to be satisfied that employers have a clearly identified common interest and that the bargain is not contrary to the public interest. That threshold needs to be met. We want to see businesses competing on quality on innovation, product and services.  Sussan Ley tries a point of order, but Milton Dick sits her down. And then Collins, who has been the target of these questions for the last couple of days seems to have had her fill:  If the shadow minister would listen carefully there are actually thresholds that need to be met. It\u2019s not just the number of employees.  It needs to be also that they need to want to bargain.  \u2026She needs to understand it is not as straightforward as she wants to say.  He also needs to understand as I have a said clearly in this place over 2 million small businesses will be unaffected, over 2 million, 90 per cent of all businesses.  The shadow minister over there has been out trying to whip out conflict and confusion about this, right?  She needs to be careful.   The shadow minister said this morning that the whole bill is terrible. Does she really think as a shadow minister that acting on sexual harassment in the workplace is terrible. Is that what she really thinks?  Does she really think...is that what she really thinks? Does she really think that making adjustments to the better off overall test that businesses have asked for, is terrible? If that is what she thinks small businesses deserve better than what the shadow minister is giving them.      2.59am    Question time is about to begin, which will interrupt the non-stop speeches on the national anti-corruption commission. The crossbench have been pushing very, very hard for public hearings, but aren\u2019t making headway on that issue, with both Labor and the Coalition on a unity ticket for \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d.  Updated at 3.12am GMT    2.56am    Karen Andrews: Women repatriated from Syria \u2018could be bringing IS ideology back with them\u2019 Still on Karen Andrews and her chat with the ABC, the former home affairs minister is asked about the repatriation of Australian women and children from Syrian camps. This is in relation to the women who went to Syria, in most cases following partners, to fight for Islamic State. Now, it is important to remember in all of this that these people are Australians. If they had been able to get to an embassy under their own steam, we would be obliged to help them. As Australian citizens, they have a right to return. Andrews says part of the reason her government didn\u2019t repatriate the women and children living in Syrian refugee camps (while other nations did) was because of the risk to Australian personnel. Asked about the risk of leaving women and children there, Andrews says:  Yes, and unfortunately the children to remain the victims of the actions of their parents. I think it was interesting, to listen to Frank [Carbone], the mayor of Fairfield, he was speaking yesterday and he was talking about and has made these comments before that while these women have come back and issued statements, effectively apologising for their actions, they actually haven\u2019t renounced the Isis ideology.  Q: The fact that they were willing to fully is probably a good indication [they had renounced]? Andrews:  Not necessarily, they could be bringing that ideology back with them. I think that what Frank has been saying is something that needs to be [examined carefully]. And it leads on to the obvious question as to why the government has refused to speak with them as in western Sydney was a they have been isolated but I\u2019m sure that the government is going to be calling on them to assist with the level of reintegration of those women and their children into those communities.  It is important to note that Australian security agencies have said that their number one focus is the safety and security of Australians. That has been their one public comment in all of this.  Updated at 3.14am GMT    2.46am    Question time is in about 15 minutes time. Woo. Hoo.     2.41am    Simon Birmingham says Labor must defend Aukus against Chinese criticisms The Coalition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, has urged the Albanese government to clearly defend Aukus against criticism from China. A recent article in the Global Times, a Chinese state-controlled outlet, argued the Aukus security partnership with the US and the UK \u201cserves to provoke China\u201d and remained \u201ca barrier to improving China-Australia ties\u201d. That article, published last weekend, said the Australian government should not ignore the Chinese government\u2019s concerns:  After the recent bilateral meeting between the Chinese and Australian leaders on the sidelines of the G20 summit, it is widely hoped that this will inject more positivity into what have been deteriorating bilateral relations. However, if Canberra chooses to ignore Beijing\u2019s concerns over Aukus, the pact will remain a thorn in the side of China-Australia relations. It is also likely to undermine a clear pathway to the healthy development of bilateral ties.  Birmingham addressed the issue during an interview with Sky News today. It follows the meeting between the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, and his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, in Cambodia yesterday. Birmingham appeared to accuse Beijing of hypocrisy in criticising Aukus. Alluding to China\u2019s own rapid military buildup, Birmingham told Sky News:  Let me firstly deal with that type of Global Times commentary, and it\u2019s important to be very clear that in saying that nations should respect the sovereignty of other nations, that applies in all manner of different decisions and it includes especially how you might work in terms of your own strategic partnerships, alliances, defence partnerships and the like. And so what Australia is doing in relation to Aukus is engaging with like-minded nations, longstanding allies and partners to ensure that we have access to the best defence technologies [and] capabilities in the future for our nation\u2019s defences and our sovereignty. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, it of course is essential that Australia does that and defends our right to do so, and we should defend it clearly against any who criticise it, particularly those who may themselves be pursuing their own military aspirations.   Updated at 2.58am GMT    2.40am    Karen Andrews \u2018very happy\u2019 about refugee resettlement arrangement with New Zealand Karen Andrews, who was a home affairs minister in the previous government, is asked about the start of the transfers of asylum seekers to New Zealand. The Coalition had opposed the offer for many years, because it didn\u2019t want the asylum seekers to have entry to Australia (New Zealand citizens have visa-free travel to Australia). A deal was worked out in the last months of the Morrison government, and Andrews says about the start of the transfers:  There is still a lot of work that needs to be put in place after the initial announcements \u2026 Of course, I would have liked it to have been happening sooner, but I do understand that it does take time.  The New Zealand government would have had to put in place the actions of \u2013 needed to be able to determine who they were going to accept into New Zealand, and that did take time.  I\u2019m very happy that this arrangement was put in place in the first instance and we were able to negotiate up. Now the people are starting to be transferred to New Zealand, I think that\u2019s a good outcome for those people and [we say] a huge thank you to the New Zealand government.   Updated at 2.51am GMT    2.29am    Average worker does six weeks of unpaid overtime a year, Australia Institute report says The Australia Institute has a new report out looking at how much unpaid overtime we are all doing. It\u2019s found that the average Australian worker is doing six weeks of unpaid overtime, which is worth $8,000 per worker per year. Most workers (84%) want the \u201cright to disconnect\u201d \u2013 to not be available to their work after hours. Across the workforce, there is about $92bn in lost income per year.  Updated at 2.44am GMT    2.16am    Rachel Perkins: \u2018the new generation will change the way Australia\u2019s [frontier wars] history is viewed\u2019 Rachel Perkins and Henry Reynolds are the people behind the series The Australian Wars, which will be shown on SBS. One of the issues is that the frontier wars are not acknowledged as part of Australia\u2019s history and are not included in the Australia War Memorial. Q: New Zealand\u2019s War Memorial has acknowledged their frontier wars and the Australian War Memorial in fact acknowledges our own colonial involvement in the New Zealand wars. What\u2019s holding Australia back, is it institutional racism? Rachel Perkins:  That\u2019s a very good question. People might not be aware of the fact that New Zealand, Aotearoa New Zealand, recently renamed what is and what were once called the M\u0101ori wars and called them the New Zealand wars. And during the process of making this series we changed the name of the series to be called The Australian Wars, because it is, after all, the war was, that founded the continent. What is holding Australia back? Well, I see there\u2019s young students here today in the audience, and I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re here. And I think the new generation, who will have access to this history for the first time in a very long time, will change the country as they take leadership roles and they\u2019ll change the way this history is viewed and it will no longer, you know, it won\u2019t be held back any more. I think it can\u2019t be held back. As Henry says, once the truth is out there, what do you do with it? That\u2019s the question. How do you act on it? And I think the next generation will indeed act on it.   Updated at 2.25am GMT    2.05am    Rachel Perkins: \u2018we forgive but not forget\u2019 Rachel Perkins is asked about the state of the \u201cculture wars\u201d now that there is a new government. Perkins says:  When the head of the RSL rejects a proposal to have inclusion of frontier conflicts in an expanded form at the War Memorial, I ... I just \u2013 I\u2019m reminded of, you know, the RSL\u2019s long tradition of banning Aboriginal people from their RSLs around the country. You know, we remember those things. You know, we forgive but not forget. And I think the country is going through a change but it\u2019s a long time coming, you know. It\u2019s far too slow for me, and many other people. But I do have great hope in the education system.   Updated at 2.09am GMT    2.04am    National Press Club address The national press club address this afternoon features Arrernte and Kalkadoon filmmaker Rachel Perkins and historian Professor Henry Reynolds talking about the Australian wars.

Updated at 2.08am GMT    1.18am    Labor drops plan to reduce access to disability pension for drug and alcohol-related conditions If you haven\u2019t read this from Luke Henriques-Gomes, you should: The Albanese government has backed down from a controversial proposal that would have made it harder for people with drug and alcohol-related conditions to get access to the disability support pension. But it is still facing calls to do more to address longstanding problems with the design of the disability pension, amid record levels of people on jobseeker living with a disability. The government has proposed new \u201cimpairment tables\u201d that govern eligibility for the pension under a once-a-decade consultation and review process.   Updated at 1.45am GMT    1.02am   Lambie calls for committee to assess preparedness for climate disasters  Senator Jacqui Lambie says she been moved by the BoM and CSIRO report into Australia\u2019s climate. She wants a committee set up to see how prepared Australia is to deal with the coming natural disasters:  I\u2019m not surprised the report says weather events are getting worse because of climate change. Everyone in Australia knows that we\u2019re having more and more floods. Bushfire season is stretching out longer every year.This is why I\u2019m setting up a Senate committee into Australia\u2019s Disaster Resilience. We need to get a plan in place now to deal with these events. We can\u2019t keep calling in the army to help. That\u2019s not what they\u2019re there for and it\u2019s stretching their capacity to protect our national security.A committee will hear from people across the country. It\u2019ll ask them about the best way to look after our communities before and after weather events hit.I\u2019m optimistic we can get this committee up by end of the sitting fortnight. Time to get our skates on and get this moving.   Updated at 1.11am GMT    12.48am    Simon Birmingham says value of Australia and China\u2019s defence ministers meeting will be in outcomes The Coalition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, has spoken to Sky News following the meeting between the defence minister, Richard Marles, and China\u2019s defence minister, Wei Fenghe, in Cambodia (a second meeting between those ministers). Birmingham said:  The test of the benefit of dialogue will be about the outcomes achieved. First and foremost we want to see peace and stability in our region. We should be able to work through difficult issues together.  Birmingham said it would be of mutual benefit for Australia and China for close economic cooperation to continue. He said it had \u201ccertainly not been to China\u2019s benefit\u201d to roll out a series of trade actions against Australian export sectors. He cited actions that were imposed by Beijing either directly though tariffs \u2013 such as in the case of barley and wine \u2013 or in \u201cmany indirect ways\u201d through other trade restrictions. He labelled this as \u201cattempted economic coercion\u201d.  Updated at 12.54am GMT    12.48am   Independent and Greens renew push to lower voting age  Could Australia get a lower voting age? Paul Karp has had a chat to the Kooyong independent, Monique Ryan, about the proposal: Independent MP Monique Ryan and the Greens will both renew a push to lower the voting age in Australia in the new year. Ryan has said she will introduce a private member\u2019s bill, to require 16 and 17-year-olds to vote but without the threat of fines, or work with the Greens, which have a bill in the Senate to extend the franchise with voluntary voting. The move follows a New Zealand court ruling that the current voting age of 18 is discriminatory, which has prompted New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to green-light a parliamentary debate on lowering the voting age. In an encouraging sign for those agitating about the issue in Australia, the special minister of state, Don Farrell, said the government had \u201cnever ruled out\u201d lowering the voting age.   Updated at 12.51am GMT    12.28am   \u2018Qantas play hardball on workplace relations\u2019 \u2013 Bill Shorten  Anthony Albanese is reportedly meeting with Qantas boss Alan Joyce today, while the IR legislation negotiations continue.  Bill Shorten was asked about the meeting on ABC RN Breakfast this morning and said he was \u201cunaware of the discussion\u201d so couldn\u2019t speak on that, but in general:  Qantas is a national carrier and there\u2019s many things that they do well, but it\u2019s a matter of record that even before I entered parliament I used to represent Qantas engineers. Qantas play hardball on workplace relations. They\u2019re entitled to their opinion and during Covid they\u2019ve been doing remarkable things. But when it comes to workplace relations, my electorate covers Melbourne airport, I have a lot of airline people who live in my electorate. I don\u2019t agree that when Qantas was laying off staff it was doing the right thing.  So Qantas has always had a particular point of view on workplace relations. They\u2019ve never hidden it. But, you know, I\u2019m going to leave Qantas to run an airline, but I don\u2019t want them in charge of the wages system of this country.   Updated at 12.33am GMT    12.15am   Liberal MP recounts her experience of family violence  Liberal MP Karen Andrews gave a very emotional speech in the chamber this morning while addressing the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, as she recounted her experience of watching someone she cared for go through a violent situation:  We all know many of these victims. And unfortunately, I\u2019m one of the people who has had to wait for text messages to come in and phone messages to come through and the phone calls are much worse, wondering if someone that you love is still alive. In the time that I have lived in this place however long it might be, I will dedicate myself to working to stop this violence. I\u2019m really sorry. For those people who have no experience you have idea what it\u2019s like and for the people who sit innocently on the side, and as I said wait for that call waiting to hear if someone they love is OK, it is traumatic. And when you\u2019re there at night and the phone rings, you wonder what you\u2019re going to hear. It is a terribly traumatic experience. But for all the things that I have experienced, there are many other people who have been on the frontline and have experienced it themselves. And for those people, I will dedicate my time left in this place to try to support you.  Andrews went on to speak on the global shift which needed to take place to end violence against women and children. She also spoke of the need to help educate people on consent and pledged her bipartisan support with the government on working on addressing all the issues around violence against women.  Updated at 3.14am GMT    11.41pm    The statistics on violence against women This Friday is the International Day for Eliminating Violence Against Women. The House isn\u2019t sitting on Friday, so there was time this morning put aside to acknowledge the day and just how far we have to go. Amanda Rishworth went through the statistics:  I\u2019d like to take this moment \u2013 here in this place \u2013 to highlight the sobering statistics that confront us here in Australia.One woman dies every 10 days in Australia at the hands of her former or current partner.Before the end of the year, based on these statistics alone, three women will lose their lives to violence, often by someone who has professed to love and care for them.Every two minutes, police around the nation deal with a domestic and family violence matter. That\u2019s 5,000 calls a week, on average.We know for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, the statistics are even starker. First Nations women are 11 times more likely to be killed due to experiencing family violence than non-Indigenous women.They are also 34 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of violence they face. The statistics here in Australia on those women who have experienced violence since the age of 15 reflect those globally \u2013 one in three. One in two women have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime.These statistics have to change.  Poverty is one of the biggest contributing factors. Financial pressure and the lack of resources can trap people in situations. Raising the Jobseeker and associated social security payment rates would have a huge impact and help achieve the goal the government has set itself to address family and domestic violence, but there has been no movement there.   Updated at 11.51pm GMT    11.27pm    Expanded role for pharmacists in Victoria under Labor The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced if re-elected at the weekend, a Labor government will spend $12m to trial an expanded role for pharmacists. Under the pilot, pharmacists will be able to treat minor illnesses like common skin conditions and administer travel vaccinations and more public health vaccinations. They\u2019ll also be able to treat straightforward urinary tract infections (UTIs) and reissue prescriptions for contraceptives. Pharmacists would receive $20 per consultation, with all fees paid by the government and patients paying no more than the current Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment for any medications required. Andrews told reporters in St Albans, in Melbourne\u2019s west:  We know that finding a bulk-billing doctor, particularly after hours, has perhaps never been harder than it is now. That\u2019s a real challenge. We got to do something about that.  He said the government would also invest $32m to incentivise doctors to become GPs. This includes $30,000 top-up payments for first-year trainee GPs to ensure they don\u2019t take a significant pay cut:  If you\u2019re a junior hospital doctor earning around $100,000 a year, if you choose general practice you\u2019re forced to take a $30,000 pay cut. Now that\u2019s an active disincentive, a barrier if you like, to more of our junior doctors choosing general practice. The best thing for us to do is to bridge that pay gap to make sure that there\u2019s no financial disincentive.   Andrews said the government would also cover the costs of their exams in their first year, investing $10,000 per trainee.  Updated at 11.53pm GMT    11.23pm    State of play in the Senate Anyway, the Senate continues to be \u2026 interesting. For what it is worth, though, on the numbers it is a progressive Senate and a lot of the usual suspects no longer have any influence on whether bills get passed or not. They are not the balance of power. And while they can still move motions, put forward private members\u2019 bills and pursue their \u201cspecial interests\u201d they can\u2019t actually change policy at this point of the political cycle. So it is swings and roundabouts  Updated at 11.44pm GMT    11.15pm    Glenn Druery debate in Senate For those who weren\u2019t glued to the Senate yesterday (I know, can you imagine NOT being absolutely riveted by a chamber of parliament?) Pauline Hanson also led a debate on: \u201cThe need for the Senate to condemn the Premier of Victoria, Dan Andrews, for his office\u2019s dealings and association with Glenn Druery who, it was reported this morning, admitted to using his position in a Senator\u2019s office for personal financial gain; and \u2013 in light of revelations upper house group voting tickets are being used to mislead voters to the unethical benefit of the Andrews Labor Government \u2013 to affirm the Senate\u2019s support for free and fair elections with integrity.\u201d Which led to this contribution from UAP senator, Ralph Babet:  The scandal is not only about Dictator\u2014sorry: Premier Daniel Andrews\u2019s deals with dodgy Glenn Druery. The real scandal is that federal Labor protect the corrupt and tyrannical Premier Dan Andrews as one of their own. That\u2019s the real scandal. Mr Glenn Druery, this political fixer, has boasted on camera about creating sham political parties in order to fool voters into voting for candidates and parties that will be cooperative to Premier Dan Andrews, when these voters might have reasonable belief that they are actually voting against Dan Andrews. This election fixing is permitted in the state of Victoria, and it is outrageous. It is outrageous that we allow this to happen to the benefit of Daniel Andrews. It beggars belief.  The motion did not receive the support it needed.  Updated at 11.39pm GMT    11.06pm   'This bill is dangerous': Greens respond to Hanson education push  Queensland Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne was not having ANY OF IT in the Senate a little earlier today:  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Legislation Amendment Children Bill 2020. I feel like I\u2019m uniquely placed to speak to this bill. I\u2019ve been a state secondary school teacher for nearly 30 years. I started out my career as a health and physical education teacher, and I also taught sexuality, human relationships and sexual education. I\u2019m also qualified to teach secondary school science as well as humanities. When I left the department, I was a head of humanities and languages. This bill seeks to put restraints on what teachers of health and physical education and sexual education, science and humanities can teach in their classes. It\u2019s not about balance. It\u2019s about hate and propaganda. We, as teachers, teach to the curriculum that we are provided. It is a curriculum that is grounded in truth and science. We don\u2019t cherrypick the bits of science that we agree with or disagree with. We don\u2019t cherrypick the bits of history that we like \u2026 And we don\u2019t discriminate against the children who are in front of us in our classes. During this debate, I\u2019ve watched people on the other side of the chamber laughing when we\u2019ve spoken about education around students\u2019 gender. I invite you to come into a school and sit in front of a student who has made several attempts on their life because they have been subject to hate and transphobia. How dare you use our young people as political footballs. They are not wanting anything except to be accepted for who they are. We teach a curriculum that is grounded in human rights and science. Young people are generous of spirit, they are accepting of others and they care about the planet and their future. They are critical thinkers and they are problem solvers and they deserve an education that is grounded in truth and justice and human rights. They deserve and education that is grounded in science. It is not teachers in schools who are attempting to indoctrinate our young people, a profession that works hard to give every young person in this country the positive future that they deserve, it is the people on the other side of this chamber who are seeking to indoctrinate their hateful and bigoted views in our schools. I will not subject young people in this country to your bigotry and hate. I will stand up every time my see it and the Greens will call it out. This bill isn\u2019t about critical thinking. This bill is about legislating a far-right curriculum. And individual senators and parties interfering in what is taught in our schools instead of leaving it to the education experts is a very slippery slope. In the US we see some states banning teachers from teaching about racism or sexuality and some are even banning books. This bill is dangerous, and as a teacher with over 30 years experience in our schools, it is an injustice to the young people in our schools and it is an insult to teachers.    Updated at 11.58pm GMT    11.04pm    Pauline Hanson\u2019s bid for education culture war Still in the Senate, and Pauline Hanson is again trying to import US culture wars to Australia. The One Nation leader is trying to get a bill she first introduced into the Senate in 2020 support. What does the bill do? Here is the official explanation:  Amends the: Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Act 2008 to require the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority to ensure that school education provides a balanced presentation of opposing views on political, historical and scientific issues; and Australian Education Act 2013 to make financial assistance to a state or territory conditional on the state or territory having certain laws in force.  Pauline Hanson\u2019s explanation is the bill does this:  The purpose of this Bill is to give parents the legal right to protect their children from indoctrination at school. Parents have the right to move their child from a school or to home school their child but they do not have the right to challenge teaching in schools such as gender fluidity theory and man-made global warming.  There is no way that this bill will get up \u2013 it won\u2019t pass the Senate, but in case it did, it is never passing the House. But the debate once again risks being very damaging against some of our most marginalised kids and their parents.  Updated at 11.06pm GMT    10.54pm    Demand for Covid documents Over in the Senate, a small cross-party group of senators are still looking looking for smoking guns. Liberal senator Alex Antic, along with his colleagues Matt Canavan and Gerard Rennick have joined with One Nation and UAP\u2019s Ralph Babet to demand this from health minister Mark Butler:  I, and also on behalf of Senators Hanson, Roberts, Rennick, Canavan and Babet, move: That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, by no later than 3 pm on Tuesday, 29 November 2022: (a) any contractual documents (without redaction) including any schedules, appendices or similar document (without redaction), for the supply, production, distribution or administration of any COVID-19 vaccine in Australia (\u2018the vaccine contracts\u2019) executed by or on behalf of the Australian Government and any of the following (\u2018the vaccine producers\u2019): (i) Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd and/or its parent companies, nominees, agents or subsidiaries, (ii) AstraZeneca Pty Ltd and/or its parent companies, nominees, agents or subsidiaries, (iii) Moderna Australia Pty Ltd and/or its parent companies, nominees, agents or subsidiaries, and (iv) Novavax Inc and/or its parent companies, nominees, agents or subsidiaries; (b) any other document referenced, referred to or incorporated into any of the vaccine contracts but not included in the contractual document; (c) any other document evidencing any pre-contractual representations with respect to effectiveness, side effects, fitness for purpose, merchantability, warranties or exclusions of warranty related to the supply, production, distribution or administration of any COVID-19 vaccine in Australia by any of the vaccine producers; and (d) any other document evidencing any indemnity, guarantee, waiver or release of liability, forbearance to sue or similar enforceable right provided by or on behalf of the Australian Government to any of the vaccine producers with respect to the supply, production, distribution or administration of any COVID-19 vaccine in Australia.   Updated at 10.59pm GMT    10.43pm   Limit on campaigners outside Victorian polling place after poor behaviour  The Victorian electoral commission is limiting the amount of campaigners outside a voting centre in Melbourne\u2019s northwest following poor behaviour. The acting electoral commissioner, Dana Fleming, says she made a legal determination to increase compliance at voting booths \u201cto ensure a safe and secure voting experience at all voting locations\u201d:  With more Victorians voting early than ever before, I am pleased to see most voters reporting a positive experience when they are going to vote. Sadly, this is not the case for all voters as a small number of campaigners are consistently behaving poorly. Today\u2019s determination acknowledges the lawful powers of election managers and election officials to respond when behaviour doesn\u2019t meet expectations. The actions of the few campaigners outside a small number of voting centres have prompted the need to consider an appropriate solution.  She says the first early voting centre to be subject to an \u201cincreased compliance approach\u201d will be the Watergardens Town Centre in Sydenham, where there will be a limit introduced on the number of campaigners allowed outside:  Due to repeated issues by those campaigning outside, we will limit the number of campaigners permitted for each candidate or party listed on the ballot paper for the District. The need to take this action is disappointing, but unfortunately necessary. The safety of voters and our election staff is our priority.  Fleming says the Electoral Act includes several offences for unacceptable behaviour in, and around, voting centres. Election managers and election officials can also request police assistance to remove a person who is disrupting the election process or obstructing access for voters.  Updated at 10.47pm GMT    10.24pm    Drive-through voting for Victorian election Victoria\u2019s electoral commission has announced a drive-through voting service for people who have tested positive for Covid ahead of the state election on Saturday. The acting electoral commissioner, Dana Fleming, said voting by phone had initially been planned for Covid-positive voters but this was scrapped when it was announced isolation requirements were ending.  In good conscience, we felt we had to offer at least one option for voters in this situation. We have an early voting centre located at a former Bunnings site in Melton West that we\u2019ve turned into a drive-through centre. There simply wasn\u2019t enough time to find and lease any other premises that were large enough to cope. Voters must stay in their car and will need to show a positive RAT or a text from the Department of Health to confirm a positive PCR test result to be eligible to use the service, as there is a very real risk that we will be inundated by voters who just like the idea of drive-through voting. We have employed registered nurses in full personal protective equipment to be the intermediary between election staff and the voter to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. It will take a little longer and I ask for voters who use the service to be as patient as possible.  The centre at 149 Barries Road, Melton West will be open between 9am and 5pm tomorrow (Thursday) and Friday, and 8am and 6pm on Saturday. If that doesn\u2019t sound like your cup of tea, you can still apply for a postal vote until 6pm tonight.  Updated at 10.31pm GMT    10.14pm    Calling all football fans Are you a football fan?

Updated at 10.19pm GMT    10.13pm   Inflation response must not include equivalent wage rises, says Lowe  One of the reasons we are feeling a little more pulled apart as a society, as Murph mentions in her report, is inflation and the rising cost of living. One of the reasons the cost of living is increasing, is because interest rates are continuing to rise \u2013 which is one of the RBA\u2019s levers to tackle rising inflation.  In Melbourne address last night, the RBA governor, Dr Philip Lowe, again said the central bank expects to increase rates further:  Given our mandate for price stability and full employment, the board expects to increase interest rates further over the period ahead. We\u2019re not on a preset path. We have not ruled out returning to 50 basis point increases if the situation requires that. Nor have we ruled out keeping interest rates unchanged for a period of time as we assess the state of the economy and the outlook for inflation. The board\u2019s priority is to return inflation to target over time. We\u2019re resolute in our determination to make sure this happens.  But Lowe also doesn\u2019t want to see wages increase too quickly, as the ABC reported from his Q&amp;A at that same Melbourne event:  If we all buy into the idea that wages have to go up to compensate people for inflation, it will be painful, so best avoid that.  So in Lowe\u2019s view, there should be no wage increases matching inflation:  If that were to happen, what do you think inflation would be at next year? 7% plus or minus (a bit). And then we\u2019ve got to get compensated for that? 7% \u2026 and this is what happened in the 70s and 80s. It turned out to be a disaster.  So interest rates will increase, which gives the banks millions more in loan repayments, which is then redistributed to shareholders (and the occasional executive bonus), and that\u2019s the cost of monetary policy, but workers shouldn\u2019t be allowed wage increases near inflation, because that would be inflationary. This is the debate at the moment (and forever). It is worth noting the RBA board doesn\u2019t have a workers\u2019 representative on it, and Lowe earns close to $1m a year. Makes understanding some of those cost-of-living pressures a little hard.  Updated at 11.56pm GMT    9.59pm    Meanwhile, Murph has looked over the latest Scanlon report looking at our social cohesion. Seems we are not as sticky:      9.54pm    For more on the climate report Tanya Plibersek will be launching, Graham Readfearn has you covered      9.52pm    Parliament will officially sit from 9am That sound you hear is coffee being desperately swallowed down, as time marches us all towards an existential crisis. Or that may just be the bells for the parliament sitting. It\u2019s hard to say.  Updated at 9.53pm GMT    9.48pm    Liberal senator says Australia needs to build its private defence technology base for Aukus to be successful The Liberal senator James Paterson gave a speech to the Menzies Research Centre National Security Network overnight, where he said Australia \u2013 and its allies \u2013needed to step up its technological advancements:  To be a credible deterrent in the region with an ability to project real power, Australia must forge a new hi-tech defence ecosystem built on the principles of free enterprise. And it must encompass more than just the big tech industry I spoke about in my speech to AEI in September. Critically, this must be done in lockstep with our Aukus allies. Australia\u2019s national security cannot rely solely on the devices of government \u2013 ours or America and the UK\u2019s. Because these challenges do not belong to Australia alone. America and the UK are under equal, if not more, pressure to strengthen their economies against high inflation and high interest, address skills shortages and improve the delivery to field-ready tech. For the Aukus partnership to live up to its full potential, we need to incentivise and build on a robust private defence technology base to help solve national security problems. For western democracies, the private sector is our key advantage over authoritarian adversaries. We need to leverage this advantage to enhance technological ingenuity, shorten acquisition cycles, turbocharge spending power, and capitalise on skills and expertise. Because western governments cannot out-innovate, out-spend, and out-perform our adversaries on our own. \u2026 We need whole of system reform to build and leverage a defence-technology base in Australia that is accessible on a reciprocal basis to our Aukus partners. While Aukus itself is movement in this direction, to succeed we need to overcome regulatory barriers like ITAR to enable cost-effective, time-efficient tech transfer between our countries. When we already share the most sensitive intelligence information through the Five Eyes network, it seems more like an oversight that this level of trust and cooperation hasn\u2019t been extended to broader defence-tech transfers and the mobility of talent. That\u2019s why addressing regulatory barriers should be a priority for Aukus. If instead we engage in an exercise of hoarding talent, intellectual property or jobs between the Aukus partners we will fail.   Updated at 9.52pm GMT    9.39pm    Food industry to call for security plan Also happening today \u2013 a massive push from the nation\u2019s food industry bodies, calling for the government to come up with a plan for Australia\u2019s food security. Supply chain shocks have really put into focus how vulnerable Australia is \u2013 the industry bodies, which includes the National Farmers Federation, Australian Meat Industry Council and Master Grocers Australia (along with more) want some concrete action. (Of course, you can also expect to hear how the government\u2019s IR bill will have a massive impact on the food industry, but that\u2019s par for the course at the moment.)  Updated at 9.46pm GMT    9.36pm    The Prime Minister\u2019s XI will be getting their caps from Anthony Albanese today, for those who observe.     9.30pm    Plibersek says Australia helped stop 1.5C target being watered-down While Australia\u2019s climate policy has improved under the Labor government, it is still the absolute bare minimum (and in a lot of cases, not enough). Asked what the government was doing, given the science of what is happening, Tanya Plibersek says:  We have already committed to a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030 and zero net emissions by 2050 and have legislated that which is very important. We have also said we will get to 82% renewable energy in our grid by 2030. We have joined with the international community \u2013 I think this is really important, at the most recent Cop meeting in Egypt our climate change minister Chris Bowen was fighting off calls from other countries to weaken those international targets on temperature rises to move away from that 1.5C maximum that countries agreed to in Glasgow to water that down. We have managed to join with like-minded countries to stop that watering down but it will take global action. We need to do our share here in Australia.   Updated at 9.32pm GMT    9.25pm    CSIRO confirms Australia\u2019s land and sea temperatures rising Tanya Plibersek will be launching the latest climate report from the BoM and CSIRO a little later this morning, which is looking at where Australia\u2019s temperatures are headed. Another spoiler \u2013 it\u2019s up. The environment minister told the ABC:  This report is one of a series done by the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO over a number of years. It confirms sadly what we know, which is that temperatures in Australia on land and in the seas are rising and that\u2019s having the impact of more extreme weather events. This report shows that the dryer periods are longer, hotter and dryer. When it does rain, it rains much more heavily and we are seeing the impact of that across the eastern states at the moment in very tragic ways. It shows that bushfire seasons will be hotter and dryer. I guess the importance of reports like this is it is a call to action and that is why our government has acted to legislate stronger carbon pollution reduction ambitions. That\u2019s why we have set aside a billion dollars for a disaster ready fund as well. It reminds us too that we need to prepare for the worst. You already have governments talking about changing land use in the future, how to better prepare our emergency services, how to better prepare our health system for these extreme events.    Updated at 9.35pm GMT    9.11pm    Treasurer welcomes OECD support for investment in cleaner energy Former Coalition finance minister Mathias Cormann delivered the OECD economic monitor overnight and \u2013 spoiler \u2013 things are dicey. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had some thoughts:  The OECD report warns the global economy has been sent reeling by the largest energy crisis since the 1970s brought about by Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Slowing growth, high and persistent inflation, and falling real wages are all wreaking havoc in major economies, leading to a blunt and brutal application of monetary policy by the world\u2019s central banks. While we\u2019re better placed than most, our economy isn\u2019t immune from this hostile and hazardous outlook. The government takes seriously the OECD\u2019s warning when it comes to making sure that fiscal policy doesn\u2019t make the job of monetary policy harder \u2013 that\u2019s why our budget was carefully calibrated to deal with the inflation challenge in our economy. Our economic plan delivers responsible and targeted cost-of-living relief, doesn\u2019t add to inflationary pressures, and begins the hard yards of budget repair. We welcome the OECD\u2019s support for the government\u2019s investments in cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy.   Updated at 9.15pm GMT    9.00pm    \u2018Wages not moving at all is a disaster\u2019 \u2013 Bill Shorten Bill Shorten is then asked about RBA chief Philip Lowe\u2019s warnings against a pay rise spiral in the context of inflation. Shorten asks why is it people earning over $100,000 who say people earning under $100,000 don\u2019t deserve a pay rise.  It all depends what the wage rise is. The reality is that when you\u2019re getting your electricity bill every quarter, when you get your gas bill every two months, when you\u2019ve got the increased costs of the kids going to school, when you\u2019ve got the mortgage payments to where the RBA is increasing the interest rates, you can\u2019t get blood out of a stone. Real people are hurting without some wages movement. These wages changes aren\u2019t going to lead to double digit increases [and increase inflation], like it\u2019s just rubbish. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. So a lot of these debates are theoretical. If wages move too far too fast, that\u2019s not desirable, but wages not moving at all is a disaster. At the end of the day, I\u2019m watching these Coalition conservative politicians and some of the senators, you know, stroke their chins and opine how terrible it is if wages go too far. The problem is wages are not going too far. The problem is they\u2019re not moving at all. The problem is that we\u2019ve got an energy shock caused by the conflict in Ukraine. The problem is we\u2019ve had people fall behind. This isn\u2019t a question that the wages system will unlock faster than inflation wage rises. I do not believe that is the case at all. But where you\u2019ve got inflation going up 7.5% and wages aren\u2019t moving at all, that\u2019s a seven and a half percent wage cut. Why is it that the experts who complain about people on less than $100,000 a year getting wage rises \u2013 they\u2019re not the ones who are under $100,000 a year.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    8.56pm    Bill Shorten said he believed it would take years for people to be able to move on from the floods:  \u2026 When I walked down the streets where people return the morning after the floods \u2026 and you just hear literal wails of despair, cries of despair, you just\u2013 it is a big deal. It\u2019s a massive deal and it\u2019s not easily resolved. And so what it reminded me of is, at least to the extent that I can control any of the relief and support is to make sure that we get payments out to people we take try and take as much of the bureaucracy out of people already dealing with trauma out of their lives.   Updated at 9.10pm GMT    8.53pm    Floods cost will run into millions, Bill Shorten says The government services minister, Bill Shorten, is speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast host, Patricia Karvelas, and says it is too early to put a dollar figure on how much the floods will have cost.  I don\u2019t think we can yet. But the costs are enormous. You\u2019re quite right. There\u2019s the individual cost when you have flood damage and water across your floorboards. It is nothing short of a disaster. Businesses are interrupted. There are farmers who were looking forward to their first really good season in the long time, and that\u2019s been heartbreaking. There\u2019ll be insurance claims, there\u2019s of course government payments to try and help people temporarily mitigate some of the effects of the flood so it\u2019ll run into hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars.   Updated at 9.08pm GMT    8.50pm    Independents to launch report on whistleblower protections Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has been arguing for more protections for whistleblowers for years. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has proposed new laws to boost whistleblower protections, but there are still calls the law needs to go further. Two of Australia\u2019s whistleblower experts, Prof A J Brown and Kieran Pender (who has written for the Guardian) have written a report on what needs to happen:  Protecting Australia\u2019s Whistleblowers: The Federal Roadmap draws on landmark research and synthesises three decades of reviews to outline a comprehensive, 12-step roadmap for better protecting and empowering whistleblowers.  That report is being launched in parliament today, in an event being hosted by Dr Helen Haines and David Pocock The report includes recommendations on what Australia needs to do, including:  Establishment of a whistleblower protection authority to oversee and enforce Australia\u2019s whistleblower protections;   Upgraded whistleblower protections for Australian public servants in line with domestic and international best practice, including a positive duty to protect whistleblowers and steps to make it easier for whistleblowers to enforce their rights;   Consolidation and harmonisation of whistleblowing laws across the private sector in one new single law covering all non-public sector whistleblowers; and   Stronger, simpler protections for whistleblowers who make disclosures to the media and members of parliament.   Updated at 9.08pm GMT    8.41pm    Inequality in Covid deaths The assistant treasury minister, Dr Andrew Leigh, is delivering a speech on inequality in Covid deaths on Wednesday night, in his capacity as assistant minister responsible for the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In the WD Borrie Lecture, Leigh will note that deaths from Covid were disproportionately concentrated among disadvantaged communities: more than three times higher in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, twice as high among people born overseas, and nearly twice as high for Indigenous Australians. In an advance copy of the speech, Leigh says:  The mortality ratios from Covid in Australia are quite similar to those estimated in other advanced nations. As a share of the population, fewer people died from Covid in Australia than in most other affluent nations. Yet among those who died, the same health inequalities can be seen in Australia as in other advanced countries. What might have driven the socioeconomic disparities in Covid mortality? And why might many of those disparities have been largest in the Delta wave? As I have noted, disadvantaged people may be less able to work remotely, more reliant on public transport, and more likely to live in crowded households. Uptake of vaccination and antiviral treatments have varied across society as vaccines and treatment became increasingly available. Another factor is that successive Covid waves have had varying degrees of severity. A final factor is that in the years since Covid began, population immunity has steadily risen.\u201d  Leigh also gives the following profile of those who died:  Across all waves of the pandemic, deaths from Covid were highest among those aged 80\u201189 years. The median age of those who died from Covid was 87.4 years for females and 83.6 years for males. Males had a higher number of registered Covid deaths than females. For every 100 female Covid deaths, there were 126 male Covid deaths. Around 3-quarters of all Covid deaths occurred in Victoria and New South Wales.   Updated at 9.07pm GMT    8.40pm   Head of World Trade Organization warns of 'slippery slope' to nuclear war  The head of the World Trade Organization has used a speech in Australia to warn that geopolitical fear and mistrust could lead to \u201caggression and ultimately a world war, this time with nuclear weapons\u201d. Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, addressing the Lowy Institute in Sydney last night, said trade had emerged as an arena for geopolitical rivalry:  Over the past decade, governments have in several instances unfortunately weaponised trade and economic interdependence as a way of handling big and small power rivalries and disagreements. In Australia today, you\u2019re living this reality in your region. Weaponisation of trade is problematic, not least, because it creates some challenges for the rule-based multilateral trading system, but also because it could slide down the slippery slope beyond a few targeted products or sectors to wider economic disruptions. And of course, when viewed as economic coercion, it could become a tit-for-tat exercise, with the possibility of slipping out of control, leading to broader, more painful repercussions: economic, political, and social. Ladies and gentleman, we would be naive to rule out the possibility that our era could meet the same end an earlier episode of power shifts and global integration did in 1914, with fear and mistrust, giving way to strategic miscalculation, misjudgment, aggression, and ultimately a world war, this time with nuclear weapons. Historians have likened our predecessors from a century ago to sleepwalkers who blundered into a catastrophe no one truly wanted. We must make better choices.  Okonjo-Iweala was not specific about which countries had weaponised trade, but in saying that Australia was \u201cliving this reality\u201d she appeared to be referring \u2013 at least in part \u2013 to the trade tensions between China and Australia. Beijing since 2020 rolled out actions against a range of Australian export sectors in moves that the Morrison and Albanese governments branded as \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d and \u201ctrade sanctions\u201d. The WTO director general may also have been referring to the tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China during the Trump administration. Okonjo-Iweala argued the fracturing of economic ties was \u201cmore likely to heighten geopolitical tensions than to soothe them\u201d, and that at a time of serious global challenges including rising inflation, climate change and the war in Ukraine \u201cwe need multilateral cooperation and solidarity more than ever\u201d. She urged governments to \u201cuse trade constructively to solve problems rather than amplify them\u201d and to \u201cmake trade a force for peace in the 21st century\u201d. She proposed an \u201calternative vision for the future of trade, interdependence, without over-dependence, deeper, more diversified and de-concentrated international markets\u201d. She summarised this idea as \u201cre-globalisation, not de-globalisation\u201d. Okonjo-Iweala also said her meetings in Canberra yesterday with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, government ministers Don Farrell, Penny Wong and Jim Chalmers, and the opposition\u2019s Simon Birmingham were \u201cvery productive\u201d:  I was grateful to hear them emphasise Australia\u2019s enduring commitment to a strong and effective World Trade Organization and to our ongoing reform efforts.   Updated at 9.06pm GMT    8.39pm   \u2018Change in tone and mood\u2019: deputy PM meets Chinese defence minister  The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has met with the Chinese defence minister at a regional summit and stressed the importance of maintaining lines of communication between their militaries. Marles is in Siem Reap, Cambodia, for the Asean defence ministers\u2019 meeting-plus to be held today. In the latest sign of the easing in tensions between China and Australia, Marles met yesterday with China\u2019s defence minister, Wei Fenghe, whom he first met in Singapore in June when a freeze on ministerial talks ended. According to a readout issued late last night by the Australian side, the two ministers \u201cacknowledged the significance of what was their second meeting since the change of government in May this year\u201d and \u201cdiscussed regional defence relations and Indo-Pacific security\u201d. The readout said:  The pair advanced discussions they commenced in June about reinstating the defence dialogue between the two countries. The deputy prime minister explained that Australia would welcome the reinstatement of that dialogue, and reiterated the importance it has played in the bilateral relationship previously, particularly in maintaining lines of communication between the two nations\u2019 militaries. Both ministers were optimistic about progressing that further. The deputy prime minister said the meeting [was] an important step in stabilising Australia\u2019s relationship with China, and welcomed any future opportunities to meet with General Wei.  In a statement last night, Marles said there was an important \u201cchange in tone and mood in our exchange\u201d.  We both remarked on the degree to which we\u2019ve come a fair way over the last few months in trying to stabilise the relationship and put it in a better place. We spoke about the possibility of further engagement back in June and we raised it again today. I\u2019m hopeful we can get things back to a better place, and dialogue with senior officials in Defence is part of that.   The latest meeting follows Anthony Albanese\u2019s summit with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in Bali last week. Marles also had bilateral meetings yesterday with his counterparts from India, South Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Indonesia.  Updated at 8.46pm GMT    8.38pm    Philip Lowe says Reserve Bank is watching wages growth in other economies The RBA Governor, Dr Philip Lowe, gave a speech in Melbourne overnight, where he warned against a \u201cprice-wage spiral\u201d, which he said would impact inflation. You can read the whole speech here, but this is a short excerpt:  Domestically, we need to avoid a price-wage spiral. To date, while wages growth in parts of the private sector has picked up materially, aggregate wage outcomes in Australia have been consistent with a return of inflation to target. In contrast, a number of other advanced economies are experiencing much faster rates of wages growth. So this is an area we are watching carefully.  Tanya Plibersek was on ABC News Breakfast this morning and was asked about the comments and said:  I am not going to make any comments about the Reserve Bank governor but it hasn\u2019t been painless. It has been a very difficult time for families. The cost of everything is going up. Their wages haven\u2019t kept pace. We know the reason wages didn\u2019t keep pace under the previous government was they said low wages were a deliberate design feature of their economic architecture and when the shadow treasurer was asked whether he supported the industrial relations changes recently, he said no because they will see wages go up. In contrast, on our side, the government wants to see wage increases, particularly for those low paid workers who have missed out. They have seen the impacts of price rises and they are coping with higher mortgages and rental costs as well. We know life has been tough and we want to make it easier by giving them a pay rise when they work hard.   Updated at 8.44pm GMT    8.33pm    Greens to push for \u2018right to disconnect\u2019 from work Australian workers are on average working six weeks unpaid overtime a year, costing them over $92bn dollars in unpaid wages. That is the conclusion of the Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Future Work report released on Wednesday, which is \u201cgo home on time day\u201d. The average worker is losing over $8,000 a year or $315 per fortnight, it found. The research reveals that employers are profiting from 2.5bn hours extra hours of work. Permanent workers, whether full or part-time, are generally paid salaries that account for all hours worked, as opposed to casuals paid by the hour. But the Centre for Future Work regards the 4.3 hours of unpaid work the average employee performs every week as a form of \u201ctime theft\u201d, amounting to 224.3 hours a year for every worker, or six standard 38-hour work weeks. Eliza Littleton, research economist at the Australia Institute and report author, said:  Our research shows unpaid overtime is a systemic, multibillion-dollar problem which robs Australian workers of time and money. This is time theft. Unpaid overtime harms our quality of life and reduces our time with family, friends, and those we care for. Time theft only further exacerbates our current cost of living crisis. With workers\u2019 share of national income at the lowest point ever, a focus on reducing unpaid overtime would improve quality of life and ease the cost of living pressure for millions. The prevalence of overtime suggests that \u2018availability creep\u2019 has eroded the boundaries between work and life.  The Australia Institute is calling for the creation of a right to disconnect, which was recently recommended by the Senate select committee into work &amp; care chaired by the Greens\u2019 Barbara Pocock. The issue isn\u2019t directly dealt with in Labor\u2019s industrial relations bill, which does create a right to request flexible work backed up by Fair Work Commission arbitration. The Greens will push for the right to disconnect to be included in future workplace legislation.  Updated at 8.39pm GMT    8.32pm    Worsening extreme weather events on the way, BoM and CSIRO say Extreme weather events including torrential downpours, searing heat and dangerous bushfire conditions are all getting worse across Australia, with even more challenging events to come, according to the latest report by the BoM and CSIRO. That said, there was relief in NSW\u2019s saturated central region, where residents in Deniliquin breathed a sigh of relief as a flood warning was cancelled. Showers are beginning to clear across NSW today after weeks of heavy rain but flood recovery efforts in the state\u2019s central west and Riverina regions have only just begun. The Bureau of Meteorology says the interrupted weather patterns are continuing, with a late-season burst of cold and windy weather moving over south-east Australia. Popular ski town Thredbo recorded the highest rainfall this week with 186.2mm, as well as the highest wind gusts across the state with 102km/h. In a reprieve for flooded towns, showers will become more isolated and contract to coastal and mountain areas. A high pressure system will develop over southern Australia from Wednesday, bringing a gradual clearing of conditions and warmer temperatures later this week.  Updated at 8.37pm GMT    8.32pm   Good morning  Welcome to Wednesday! And a big thank you to Martin for starting us off. This week just never seems to end. It is still all about IR. With some national anti-corruption commission and privacy thrown in for good measure. The back and forth between Tony Burke and David Pocock continues. While that is going on, Burke is also having to deal with mounting campaigns from industry and the opposition, who feel they have been dealt back in to the national conversation with this legislation. It\u2019s a bit of a mess, but hey that\u2019s the Australian parliament! We will continue following all of the moves as the issue inches towards a resolution. The Senate has already agreed to sit an extra two jam packed days to try to get through everything, but it may still need more. Woohoo! You have Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst watching Canberra for you. Mike Bowers is still on assignment (we miss you Mikey!) and you have a four-coffee Amy on the blog. Being Wednesday, I have about one-quarter of my brain left. Good times. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.  Updated at 8.33pm GMT    8.20pm   Daniel Andrews won leaders debate, according to poll  Undecided Victorian voters have awarded the premier, Daniel Andrews, a narrow victory over Liberal counterpart Matthew Guy in their first and only leaders debate of the election. You can read Benita Kolovos\u2019s report, here:  AAP reports that in a bitter election campaign, the pair largely showed restraint as they faced off before 100 undecided voters at the Box Hill town hall last night. It took about half an hour for the pair to trade blows, with the Coalition\u2019s plan to quarantine all new gas discovered in Victoria for state-only use the source of contention.  Labor has been running attack ads on social media in the lead-up to the 26 November poll claiming the Liberals will overturn the state\u2019s constitutional ban on fracking. Host Kieran Gilbert asked the Labor leader whether he would commit to pulling the ads but Andrews was adamant it wasn\u2019t misinformation. The premier cited reports from the state\u2019s chief scientist that there are currently \u201cno proven and probable onshore conventional gas reserves in Victoria\u201d. \u201cThe only way you can deliver a \u2018gas-led future\u2019 is to frack. That\u2019s just a fact,\u201d Andrews said. But Guy said another report from the chief scientist found up to 830PJ of onshore gas was ready and waiting to be unearthed through convention means. \u201cI\u2019m not here for petty name-calling \u2026 We\u2019re not going to frack,\u201d he said. The combatants later sparred over integrity and Victoria\u2019s mounting debt, but ultimately the discussion circled back to health. Given the opportunity near the end of the hour-long debate to ask questions of one another, Andrews went on the attack.  Updated at 10.24pm GMT    8.18pm   Welcome  Good morning everyone and welcome to our politics live blog. We\u2019ll be getting into the meat of things very soon but first up here are some of the top stories this morning (other than the Socceroos v France, of course).  The Albanese government has fast-tracked a final vote on the territory rights bill in a bid to shore up its chances of passing industrial relations law changes this year. It sets up a marathon sitting fortnight as the government rushes to pass bills such as its IR reform. The current intense political bargaining in Canberra was given interesting economic context in a speech by Reserve Bank chief, Philip Lowe, last night. He warned that interest rates could be set for a period of volatility as globalisation recedes and the world copes with climate change, spelling uncertainty for Australian households. After years of low inflation, the recent surge in prices had been \u201cquite a shock\u201d, Lowe said. Geopolitics, inflation and climate also play a central part in social cohesion as the latest snapshot of Australian society by the Scanlon Foundation shows. Its study finds that cohesion has reduced since the pandemic \u2013 when it spiked \u2013 and that those big international factors play a big part in making people less comfortable in society.   "

                    "body": "For many years, perhaps decades, the republican cause in this country has held its breath while effectively waiting for Queen Elizabeth II to draw the last of her own. If that sounds insensitive, it is in fact a testament to the strength, as well as the longevity, of her reign. Earlier this year, leading up to the Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee, I spent a fruitless couple of days attempting to elicit the views of serving politicians who were known or thought to have republican sympathies. Hardly any responded and only one would go on the record. That exception was Clive Lewis, the Labour MP and 2020 party leadership candidate, who articulated the problem of being an open republican. \u201cThe Queen is seen as someone who is hard working, humble, etc,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that makes it very difficult for the republican argument to be put forward. But I think when she does pass away, that will open up the possibility of conversations about the future of our democracy.\u201dThis month, after 70 years, the longest reign in British history, that moment finally arrived. However, it brought forth the most prolonged glorification of, and visible public support for, the crown since the Queen\u2019s coronation in 1953. While this funereal fanfare may have been concentrated on the late Queen, rather than her successor, King Charles III, the sheer scale of both the state-orchestrated and public acts of bereavement seemed to reaffirm the centrality of the monarchy to British life.\nThere was the near total saturation of media coverage, posters commemorating the Queen on every high street, streams of commercial enterprises all eager to demonstrate their respect, the postponed sporting events, the huge crowds at Buckingham Palace, the slow progress of the coffin in Scotland and then the flight \u2013 said to be the most tracked in history \u2013 south, the heavy air of solemnity beneath which Prince Andrew managed to creep back into public life, the lying in state, \u201cthe queue\u201d with its five-mile tailback and close to 24-hour waiting times and of course the resplendent funeral itself on Monday, which was hastily made a public holiday.\n\nHowever one looks at it all, it certainly hasn\u2019t felt like a lift-off moment for republicanism. Yet for Graham Smith, who heads the pressure group Republic, the commemorations were much less impactful than he expected them to be. \u201cI thought there would be a more prevalent sense of mourning and a lot more shouting down of dissenting voices,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what a more prevalent sense of mourning would have looked like \u2013 massed wailing? Mandatary black clothing in public? As a spectacle of popular sentiment, it was by any reckoning astonishing, with the Queen\u2019s coffin in Westminster Hall acting like the Ka\u2019bah in Mecca, the centrepiece of something that looked very much like an almighty pilgrimage. And as for tolerance of dissent, that wasn\u2019t the experience of the barrister Paul Powlesland, who was threatened with arrest for carrying a blank piece of paper in central London that, if written upon, he was informed by a policeman, had the potential to \u201coffend people, around the King\u201d.\nBut Smith, who is promoting the hashtag #NotMyKing, is adamant that the public response to the Queen\u2019s death was smaller than it seemed. \u201cIt\u2019s a minority interest that has been projected by broadcasters as a national outpouring of grief,\u201d he says. It\u2019s true that much of the broadcast and press coverage often seemed as if it had been scripted by Nicholas Witchell, the BBC\u2019s famously obsequious royal correspondent. Indeed, so alienated were many people by the proceedings, says Smith, that Republic gained \u201cthousands of new members\u201d. But the problem for republicans is that the monarchists seemed to gain millions of new supporters, if the public desire to \u201cshow respect\u201d is anything to go by.\n* * *\nThis extended display of mourning, or \u201cnecrothon\u201d, as some cynics have called it, goes to the core of the longstanding division between republicans and monarchists. Dating back to the English civil war, republicanism has been seen as coldly rationalist, whereas monarchism has traditionally laid claim to the emotions. It\u2019s the battle between head and heart, roundhead and cavalier, puritan and, what exactly, libertine? Only in this last polarity has republicanism scored a hit, with the various scandals of the royals\u2019 private lives, most damagingly in the case of Andrew, exposing the decadence that is the disreputable companion of material privilege.\nSmith says that his original plan was to keep a low profile during the mourning but he reversed that strategy in response to what he says was a high level of online debate. Of course to the vast majority of people, Smith\u2019s profile is so low as to be invisible. This is a shortcoming that has afflicted republicanism ever since the death of Oliver Cromwell and one of the reasons why it has struggled in recent times to develop into an organised movement: it lacks recognisable figureheads.\nThere are, of course, well-known people who would describe themselves as republicans. Wikipedia has a list of advocates in the UK, people such as Russell Brand, Frankie Boyle, the former footballer Joey Barton and a disproportionately large number of journalists. Apart from a general overrepresentation of the awkward squad, it reads as a random collection of people, as though what they had in common was a star sign or a minor ailment. None of them is renowned for their republicanism or, if at all known for it, in a decidedly secondary or tertiary fashion. And some might even be surprised to see themselves on the list.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re correct,\u201d concedes Norman Baker, the republican former Liberal MP, who wrote a book called \u2026 And What Do You Do? that exposed the skeletons in the Windsors\u2019 cupboards and performed a kind of cost-benefit analysis of the current setup. \u201cWe don\u2019t have figureheads. I mean,\u201d he adds, with due humility, \u201cGraham and I are the two most identifiable figures.\u201d\nThe author and activist Catherine Mayer, who wrote a revealing biography of the then Prince Charles and is also co-founder of the Women\u2019s Equality party, describes herself as \u201can instinctive republican\u201d but a cautious one who recognises the substantial role of the monarchy in British life. She believes the reason republicanism remains so muted is not so much because of a lack of a charismatic leader as a lack of a vision. \u201cYou need to root republicanism in an understanding of why the royals are part of a system that excludes so many people and serves so many people badly,\u201d she says. \u201cThe bit for me that\u2019s missing from British republicanism is the vision of the society you want to create.\u201d\nIn her book on Charles, she says, she talks about the simplicity of some approaches to republicanism \u2013 \u201cYou just cross out \u2018queen\u2019 and write in \u2018president\u2019\u201d \u2013 but she adds: \u201cThat\u2019s so not true. If you want change, you don\u2019t go with the structures that are there. Yes, the crown is a very obvious symbol \u2013 and in some ways guarantor, of inequality \u2013 but it is by no means the only structural problem.\u201d\nMayer has been a longstanding critic of what she sees as a lack of diversity in Republic. She says that in the past she\u2019s attended meetings of the pressure group that have been little more than a talking shop for white, middle-aged, middle-class men. Smith rejects this characterisation, insisting that the profile of the membership has changed. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot more younger people engaged and a lot more diversity with our supporter base. I think a lot of people of Caribbean heritage have been pretty angry about issues around Meghan and Harry but also reparations and colonialism.\u201d\n* * *\nIn polls, the number of people who express some kind of support for republicanism varies between about 15% and 30%, depending on how the question is phrased and what kind of crisis the royal family happens to be undergoing at the time. But the heftiest support is always among the young. In a poll conducted earlier this year by YouGov for Republic, 27% of the population supported the abolition of the monarchy, but the figure was 40% in the 18-24 group, which was higher than the number in the same age group who wanted the monarchy to continue.\nLike clubbing and backpacking, republicanism seems to be something people grow out of. But given that it\u2019s the young who are accused of setting the \u201cwoke\u201d agenda, it\u2019s striking how little of their ire has focused on the Windsors in general and the sovereign in particular. The royal family remains manifestly uncancelled. Only Andrew, as a result of his friendship with the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual assault, which he settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in a civil case earlier this year, has become a loathed figure among the young. And it will be instructive to see how Charles deals with his brother, who remains a counsellor of state, one of four people who can step in for the King.\n\nEven leaving Andrew aside, it would be a challenge to conceive of a more anti-woke entity than the royal family. Equality and diversity are anathema to what is a feudal institution based on birthright, deference and the maintenance of bloodline. Throw in the fact that most British colonial exploitation and crimes, including slavery, were committed in the name of the crown and it would seem to embody all that the young find most offensive.\nIf republicanism could tap into this well of youthful anger and retarget the growing debate about empire and historical reparations at the most conspicuous symbol of British imperialism, then it might gain some momentum. When I ask Smith who are the young republicans making waves, he cites the political commentator Ash Sarkar, renowned for telling Piers Morgan that he was an idiot and she was a communist. So I call her up, but she\u2019s on holiday and doesn\u2019t want to speak.\n\nBoth Smith and Baker express their annoyance with the lack of republican voices seen on broadcast media, particularly the BBC, which has been at its most fawning in the past few weeks. But it is politicians who refuse to come out as republicans and \u201ctake the matter on\u201d who most frustrate them. Lewis believes the royals are not just symbols but an integral part of a network of power and privilege and he describes the reluctance of the left to address the issue as \u201cbizarre\u201d. Even Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong republican, refused to look at republicanism when he was leader of the Labour party. He could see that there was no political advantage in entering into the debate. And that is a real problem in terms of turning republicanism from an idea into a movement. It\u2019s a cause that\u2019s seen as a sideshow, a \u201cdistraction\u201d as the future Labour leader George Lansbury memorably put it almost a century ago.\nThe constitutional historian Peter Hennessy tells me that it would be a \u201chuge\u201d legal and bureaucratic undertaking to unscramble \u201ca thousand years of history\u201d and even Baker acknowledges that to scrap the monarchy would be complicated and would \u201ctake years\u201d. Yet whatever the obstacles and practicalities, politics is also about symbolism and identity and we live in an era of Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement, of hashtags and toppled statues, when such things can have powerful significance.\n\nThe protest model from which Baker and Smith draw most optimism, however, is Brexit, a political movement that had limited traction then suddenly took hold, secured a referendum and won it. But, lacking a populist protest politician such as Nigel Farrage, an insurgent party such as Ukip or disaffected MPs who can apply pressure to their party, the republican cause\u2019s chances of a gaining referendum on republicanism seems fantastically remote \u2013 unless something drastic occurs.\nWhich brings us back to Charles. A fickle mixture of diffidence and entitlement, he offers hope to the republican cause because he is much more likely to voice his opinion than his mother, who believed that monarchs, like Victorian children, should be seen but not heard. Now 73, he has campaigned against modern architecture and in favour of green issues but not without a tendency to reveal a spoilt nature. While the consensus opinion seems to be that he enjoyed a good mourning period, with a speech to the nation that was well received, there were also several telling hiccups.\nThe first came when Clarence House, his base as Prince of Wales, rushed out redundancy notices almost as soon as the Queen died. \u201cA massive own goal\u201d, as Mayer puts it. Then he announced that his son William would take over his position as Prince of Wales, inflaming Welsh nationalists, who once again saw London intruding without invitation into Welsh affairs. And finally he was filmed having a tantrum over a faulty pen while signing the visitors\u2019 book at Hillsborough Castle, near Belfast, one of no less than 12 stately homes the King possesses.\n* * *\nAs the country slumps toward recession amid a cost of living crisis, and homelessness and food banks grow, republicans will be looking for a Marie Antoinette effect, the let-them-eat-cake indifference that was said, perhaps apocryphally, to help spark the French Revolution. As much as Charles would like to be seen as a good egg and sensitive soul, it\u2019s his desperate yearning for the public\u2019s respect that could prove his undoing. \u201cHe\u2019s always had the potential to be in some ways more engaging than his mother and move things on for the monarchy,\u201d says Mayer. \u201cBut he\u2019s also always been his own worst enemy. Those two aspects of his character have long coexisted and there\u2019s no reason to think why, as king, they would cease to coexist.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if he manages to rein in his activism and political statements, she believes, because he would still be hobbled by a past that includes dubious methods of charitable fundraising \u2013 he reportedly received more than \u00a32.5m in cash between 2011 and 2015 from the former prime minister of Qatar and his close aide Michael Fawcett resigned last year after \u201ccash for honours\u201d allegations. \u201cThere is also a body of opinion he feels very passionate about, like net-zero carbon emissions and anti-fracking, that will put him at odds with this government,\u201d says Mayer.\n\nParadoxically, being at odds with a Tory government would go down well with many of those with republican sympathies, thus neutering antipathy towards the monarchy. This is one of the more perverse royal survival mechanisms \u2013 that from time to time some members of \u201cthe Firm\u201d come to be viewed almost as popular figures of resistance against the establishment. The King\u2019s first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, successfully pulled off this manoeuvre, although she was seen as a conscientious objector to Windsor hypocrisy, not as an opponent to a government. To some extent, Diana\u2019s son Harry and his wife, Meghan, have inherited this mantle. How Charles deals with the Sussexes could have a bearing on how successful he is in defusing the time bomb of a colonial reckoning, both at home and in the Commonwealth at large. Equally, Mayer believes that any republican organisation that wants to expand its following needs to attract \u201cthe kind of people whose dislike for the monarchy has been radicalised by what happened to Meghan and Harry\u201d.\nIn other words, so embedded in British culture is the royal family that anyone wishing to defend or dismantle it will need to recruit dissident royals to their cause. The other main threat facing Charles is the disintegration of his kingdom by means of secession. In Northern Ireland, with Sinn F\u00e9in now the largest party, as it jointly is in the republic, the prospect of a united Ireland is an increasingly viable topic for discussion. In Scotland, the combined effect of Brexit and a Conservative government that has barely any local support has also galvanised calls for another referendum on independence. In Wales too there is growing discontent.\n\nAgain, these situations offer opportunities to the republican cause \u2013 if a kingdom is no longer united, does it need a king? \u2013 but they leave republicans at the mercy of external agendas. Do they want to be seen as in cahoots with republicans in Ireland? Do they risk being positioned in opposition to the very makeup of the British state, a stance that would be presented as unpatriotic? \u201cI\u2019m not sure that Scotland will separate,\u201d says Smith. \u201cBut if it did, I would say within a decade it would become a republic. This would be dynamite under the foundations of the monarchy, not least because we would see what the alternative was.\u201dGiven all the pressures on the union and all the constitutional headaches that abolishing the monarchy would involve, the likelihood is that the majority of the British \u2013 and certainly of the English \u2013 population will remain loyal to the crown. Even Baker recognises this fact, which is why, he says, he supports the idea of a \u201cbicycling monarchy\u201d, along the more modest lines of the Scandinavian or Dutch royal families. In logical terms, this makes sense. After all, there\u2019s been talk for years of the need to slim down the royal family. It\u2019s the emotional reality that gets in the way. Many of us may not understand it, or much like it, but it\u2019s in its extravagant exceptionalism, its outsize pomp and pageantry, as writ spectacularly large in the past few weeks, that much of the appeal of the British royal family lies.\nBaker concedes that some of this splendour could be retained but dismisses the need for ceremonial prominence as a foundation on which we decide how to organise our democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we should base our constitution on what tourists want,\u201d he complains. \u201cAnd in any case, what\u2019s the royal palace with the most visitors in Europe? The Palace of Versailles \u2013 and they got rid of their monarchy in 1848.\u201d He says it\u2019s akin to the other objection to republicanism he most often hears: do you want Tony Blair as president? \u201cWell, no, we don\u2019t,\u201d he answers himself. \u201cBut we wouldn\u2019t elect him, would we, so that doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\nNo, we won\u2019t elect Blair as president, nor, given the current lack of demand, will we elect anyone else. That could all change with the reign of Charles III, who may or may not turn out to be the king the republican cause has been waiting for. But if that\u2019s to happen, he will have to gather together all his petulance, insecurity and overweening sense of privilege and make a complete hash of things, because republicanism doesn\u2019t yet look as if it\u2019s any fit state to make the case itself.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2022. A comment by Catherine Mayer in an earlier version mistakenly attributed to Graham Smith the quote, \u201cYou just cross out \u2018queen\u2019 and write in \u2018president\u2019\u201d. In her book, she describes this proposition in similar terms as being the argument of \u201csome British republicans\u201d."

Before we go, let\u2019s recap the big stories:  Vigils for dead schoolboy Casisus Turvey have been held across the country. Taronga zoo has promised a \u2018full review\u2019 after an adult lion and four cubs escaped an enclosure. The robodebt royal commission heard the scheme went ahead after being backed by then Social Services minister Scott Morrison, and a top law firm warned the department the scheme was unlawful in 2018. Anthony Albanese has again defended his decision not to attends the Cop27 climate summit, saying \u2018I can\u2019t be in all places at once\u2019. Andrew Wilkie has welcomed the decision to change the \u2018gamble responsibly\u2019 warning to \u2018chances are, you\u2019re about to lose\u2019 but urged the federal government to \u2018go much further\u2019 The SES is preparing for possible record-breaking floods in Forbes as fresh warnings were issued for dozens of areas in rural NSE. The foreign minister Penny Wong signed a new strategic partnership agreement between Australia and Thailand. The Victorian crossbench MP Fiona Patten released a new ad ahead of the state election warning women\u2019s reproductive rights could be under threat.Thank you for spending part of your day with us, we will be back tomorrow to do it all again.   Updated at 8.20am GMT    7.47am    The rush for minerals to supply the global effort to ditch fossil fuels will place added stress on the environment and could worsen corruption, but offers the mining sector the chance to recast its image, a major industry event has heard. Even with the prospect of rapid expansion, the industry faces big challenges in attracting and keeping talent.      7.39am    Castlereagh Highway closed by floods with Walgett, Collarenebri and Lightning Ridge isolated SES update 2/2: The Murrumbidgee River is swollen and is now affecting Wagga Wagga and surrounding areas. Emergency warnings have been issued for parts of North and East Wagga Wagga and Wilks Park. The Castlereagh Highway is now closed, with the communities of Walgett, Collarenebri and Lightning Ridge now isolated. The NSW SES will be working with these isolated communities to ensure they have regular resupply drops and support. The SES assistant commissioner Nicole Hogan appreciates the fatigue and hard work in these affected communities, but says it is more important than ever to be aware of the conditions. \u201cAvoiding flood water, staying up to date with what\u2019s happening in your area and listening to our warnings are ways to keep you and your family safe,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cNSW SES members have been working tirelessly throughout this event, responding to ongoing floods for extended months. We encourage communities to extend their thanks to our volunteers and partner agencies for their efforts as we head into more flooding.\u201d  Updated at 7.58am GMT    7.38am   SES prepares for possible record-breaking floods in Forbes  We have a flood update from the SES here. 1/2: As the NSW State Emergency Service surpasses 10,000 requests for assistance in a seven-week period, volunteers are preparing for possible record-breaking floods in the Forbes area. Despite a brief pause in rainfall, water is still moving quickly in riverine and catchments, particularly in western and southern NSW. In the last 24 hours (to 3pm Wednesday 2 November), NSW SES has responded to 547 requests for assistance and 27 flood rescues. Areas of these flood rescues include Cowra, Tamworth, Albury, Gundagai, Forbes and Gunnedah. More than 10,000 requests for assistance have been made since this flood event commenced in September.  Along the Lachlan River, the NSW SES is keeping a close eye on Forbes, which is predicted to reach record flood levels later this week. NSW SES volunteers and partner agencies are preparing to doorknock the community, issuing a reminder to residents to be prepared and have a plan. The NSW SES assistant commissioner, Nicole Hogan, said people in the Forbes area have seen flooding before, but not to this extent in recent times. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in areas like Forbes is referred to as \u2018blue-sky floods\u2019,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cEven when the rain has stopped falling, water is continuing to move downstream through various catchments, creating issues with river rises and renewed flood peaks.\u201d  Updated at 8.01am GMT    7.28am   Crowds gather for Cassius Turvey vigils across the country  I\u2019ve got some more pictures from vigils for the 15-year-old Noongar boy Cassius Turvey being held across the country.

A 21-year-old man has been charged with the Indigenous teenager\u2019s murder after the alleged attack on 13 October when Cassius and several of his friends were walking home from school in Middle Swan.   Updated at 8.01am GMT    7.00am    Two generators offline at Queensland coal power station after tower partially collapses A major Queensland coal power station connected to the national grid will have two of its four generators offline at once for three weeks after a cooling tower partially collapsed at the facility, AAP reports. State-owned electricity generator CS Energy says none of the 226 workers at the complex were hurt when part of a cooling tower collapsed at the Callide C power station near Biloela, in central Queensland, on Monday. The incident is the second industrial accident at the complex. It comes 16 months after an explosion in a turbine hall knocked out the C4 generation unit back in May 2021. CS Energy, which operates the Callide C plant as a joint venture with InterGen, says the damage and repairs are still being assessed.  Updated at 7.13am GMT    6.50am    Taronga zoo provides new details on lion escape We have an update from Taronga zoo on this morning\u2019s lion escape. In a statement the zoo said the lions are back in their enclosure:  An initial review of this morning\u2019s incident has confirmed that an integrity issue with a containment fence enabled five lions to temporarily exit their main exhibit. The lions are now in a back-of-house holding area while a full review continues. A full report will now be prepared for the NSW Department of Primary Industries. Keepers and vets report all lions are doing well. Taronga Zoo remains open and is extremely grateful to its staff and the community for their support today.    Updated at 6.57am GMT    6.35am   Top law firm warned department robodebt was unlawful in 2018, inquiry hears  The Department of Social Services received \u201ccatastrophic\u201d draft legal advice warning the robodebt scheme was unlawful from a top private law firm in 2018, a royal commission has heard. The botched Centrelink debt scheme, established in 2015, ran until November 2019 and was vigorously defended by government departments and ministers until that point. But an inquiry heard on Wednesday that Clayton Utz provided legal advice drafted by a partner and senior counsel after an administrative appeals tribunal matter raised the issue of income averaging to raise Centrelink debts. It suggested that the use of income averaging in this way \u2013 the central tenet of the scheme \u2013 was unlawful. The advice was sent to a legal team at the Department of Social Services that included Anne Pulford, who had warned the scheme was likely unlawful before it was established but subsequently suggested it was legally justifiable in separate advice when it was up and running in 2017. Internal emails aired at the inquiry suggested that a Department of Social Services official viewed the advice as \u201csomewhat unhelpful\u201d if the department wanted to continue with the scheme. The inquiry heard the email said Clayton Utz indicated it may be able to rework the legal advice subtly if this \u201ccauses catastrophic issues\u201d for DSS but that there was \u201cnot a lot of room\u201d to do so. The counsel assisting the commission, Justin Greggery, put to Pulford: \u201cSurely you appreciated that whatever view you expressed in 2017 through the ombudsman\u2019s process \u2026 the department had in its possessions external legal advice which said that the robodebt scheme was not lawfully sustainable?\u201d Pulford said: \u201cI don\u2019t recall the details of this advice but I presume I did.\u201d Greggery said: \u201cIt must have dawned on you at this time this was one of the more significant legal advices in respect of an issue that you had been dealing with since November 2014, a period of almost four years.\u201d Pulford replied: \u201cI\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t but I don\u2019t recall.\u201d The inquiry heard that Pulford then wrote an email to other DSS officials asking \u201chow you\u2019d like to progress this given the conclusion and a limited room to adjust the outcome\u201d. Pulford said she did not know what happened to the draft legal advice after that point. She repeatedly told the inquiry she had little awareness of the media attention and political attention around the robodebt scheme around this period. Greggery said: \u201cSurely there was a discussion in 2018 after you forwarded the email ... where you said, what are we going to do with this advice?\u201d Pulford replied: \u201cI presume there was but I have no recollection as to whether that was a discussion that took place and whether it was with me or not.\u201d The royal commission before Catherine Holmes continues.  Updated at 6.51am GMT    6.19am    Victorian Liberals\u2019 \u2018Ditch Dan\u2019 ambulance prompts legal questions As the Victorian political press pack piled on to premier Daniel Andrews\u2019 Labor bus on Tuesday morning \u2013 the first official day of the state\u2019s election campaign \u2013 the opposition unveiled its own set of wheels. With the Coalition ditching the campaign bus in the lead up to the 26 November election, it will instead rely on a \u201cDitch Dan\u201d restored circa 1970s ambulance travelling around the state to remind voters of the state\u2019s burdened healthcare system.   Updated at 6.41am GMT    6.08am    Home loan refinancing set to rocket as fixed loans at rock bottom rates start moving to variable The impact of the first five Reserve Bank cash rate rises this year was felt in the property market in September with subdued new borrowing and refinancing activity for owner-occupiers and investors, according to the latest ABS Lending Indicators data released today. Commenting on the fall in new lending and refinancing activity, the Canstar Group executive Steve Mickenbecker said: \u201cSpring has not sprung this year in the housing market, as high interest rates continued to gnaw into new housing lending during September.\u201d  The banks have been competing hard in the relatively low risk refinance segment to supplement declining volumes of new lending, but even refinance declined, albeit from an all-time record in August. The retreat of borrowers from the refinance market defies logic when a shift from the average package rate from the majors to the lowest in the market could save them almost 2.31 percentage points. This is effectively protection from another nine 0.25 percentage point Reserve Bank rate increases. We can expect refinance to rocket up in coming months, as fixed rate loans written in the boom of two years ago at rock bottom rates start moving to variable. A move to the average variable rate will see a doubling of many borrowers\u2019 interest rates in one hit, surely enough to get them to sit up and take notice.   Updated at 6.30am GMT    5.58am    Australian share market edges higher after day of choppy trading The local share market has edged higher after a day of choppy trading, with gains for the commodity players outweighing losses by the property and tech sectors, AAP reports. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Wednesday finished up 9.8 points, or 0.14%, to 6,986.7, with the index crossing above the 7,000 level no fewer than seven times during the course of the day. The broader All Ordinaries closed up 8.2 points, or 0.11%, to 7,177.8. It was the third straight day of gains for the market, and its seventh winning session out of the past eight. The Australian dollar was buying 64.20 US cents, unchanged from Tuesday\u2019s close.  Updated at 6.14am GMT    5.47am    Who\u2019s eligible for energy bill relief?

Updated at 6.12am GMT    5.34am    \u2018Take a deep breath\u2019 over nuclear-capable US B-52s, Richard Marles says The defence minister, Richard Marles, has urged people to \u201ctake a deep breath\u201d over the plans to accommodate up to six US B-52 aircraft in the Northern Territory at a time. Marles was asked at a press conference in Townsville today about the planned US-funded construction of an aircraft parking site at RAAF Base Tindal, 320km south-east of Darwin. A journalist asked the deputy prime minister whether he was worried about having nuclear-capable bombers in the NT and whether this could be seen as a provocative move in a fragile region. Marles replied:  I think everyone needs to take a deep breath here. What we\u2019re talking about is a US investment in the infrastructure at Tindal, which will help make that infrastructure more capable for Australia as well. In terms of US bombers, they\u2019ve been coming to Australia since the 1980s. They\u2019ve been training in Australia since 2005. All of this is part of an initiative which was established in 2017. We do defence exercises with the United States, and we do them with their bombers \u2026 And this is an important investment in the Tindal Air Base for which Australia will be a significant beneficiary.  China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday that the plan by the US and Australia \u201cescalates regional tensions, gravely undermines regional peace and stability, and may trigger an arms race in the region\u201d.  Updated at 5.47am GMT    5.21am    Online gambling companies should work together to limit damage, Wilkie says Wilkie says there are other areas for gambling reform:  I think the most obvious reform and probably the easiest reform to be implemented is for the online gambling companies to be talking to each other in real time so when an online gambler reaches their daily limit with one of the companies, then they are blocked from gambling on all their other apps. In other words they are prevented from just swiping to a new app and starting gambling again and running up another hefty title with another Australian company. I have spoken to insiders from within the online gambling industry and they are upfront. They say it is technically very straightforward, it wouldn\u2019t cost them anything significant at all so it could be done, it could be done and rolled out very, very quickly if either the gambling companies themselves do the right thing or if the federal government was to legislate it.   Updated at 5.29am GMT    5.19am    Gambling ad reforms good but \u2018only the start\u2019 of tackling addiction, Wilkie says The independent MP Andrew Wilkie is currently on Afternoon Briefing talking about the gambling advertising reform announced this morning. He says he is happy with the announcement:  That simple message gamble responsibly with a voiceover so quick you can\u2019t make it out, it has really been a bit of theatre by the gambling companies. They got to say something so they do that and they don\u2019t really care whether it amounts to much. So these reforms today that have been announced are good but I would like to point though that they are only a start. There are other ways that we can make online gambling much safer and we really need the government to consider other reforms because the rate of gambling addiction with an online gambling is significant, it is going up. We don\u2019t know the exact amount of money that is lost each year, was looking at some figures this morning a few years old and it was over $1 bn a year was being lost by Australian online gamblers back then.    Updated at 5.28am GMT    5.11am   Fiona Patten releases ad warning abortion rights could be under threat in Victoria  The Victorian crossbench MP Fiona Patten has released a new ad ahead of the state election warning women\u2019s reproductive rights could be under threat. The Reason party leader, who has helped introduce safe access zones around abortion clinics during her eight years in parliament, has said she fears a new religious bloc in the Liberal party, combined with a larger group of Labor MPs from the traditionally conservative retail workers\u2019 union and a crossbench possibly dominated by right-wing micro-parties, could seek to undermine the state\u2019s abortion laws.\u201cThey will come from Labor, from the Liberals and also from the cross bench, forming a cartel that could wind back the gains we have seen on abortion since the 1960s,\u201d she said. Patten and East Melbourne clinical psychologist Dr Susie Allanson feature in the ad, both of them stripping off their tops to say most politicians are not open and don\u2019t bare their real feelings about the issue.

The royal commission is investigating the failed debt recovery scheme, which ran from July 2015 until November 2019 and culminated in a $1.8bn settlement between the government and hundreds of thousands of people issued unlawful Centrelink debts.   Updated at 5.10am GMT    4.51am   University of Melbourne to back pay $22m to staff who weren't paid properly  The University of Melbourne will back pay $22 million to about 15,000 current and former casual staff after many were incorrectly paid for minimum engagements or weekend work. It works out to an average of $1,476 per worker, including interest and superannuation. Impacted workers were employed under 2013 and 2018 enterprise agreements, with about 60% of cases involving the incorrect payment during casual minimum engagements. Almost 30% of cases related to pay for weekend or public holiday overtime, with the discrepancies picked up during a Deloitte review of more than 3.2 million payslips. Prof Duncan Maskell, vice-chancellor, said the university was determined to resolve the issue. \u201cWe apologise to any past or present employees who have not been paid correctly for work they performed,\u201d Maskell said in a statement. \u201cWe remain committed to strengthening the University\u2019s governance structures, systems and processes and this continues to be an area of focus for our institution.\u201d \u2013 via AAP   Updated at 5.05am GMT    4.40am   Australia and Thailand ink strategic pact  Australia has signed a new strategic partnership agreement with Thailand after talks with the Asian nation\u2019s deputy prime minister. The agreement comes as Australia and Thailand commemorate 70 years of diplomatic relations. The agreement signed by foreign minister Penny Wong on Tuesday includes cooperation on net-zero emissions, health, trade and security. Wong met with Thai deputy prime minister Don Pramudwinai during a visit to Bangkok. She said Australia would continue to work closely with Bangkok on areas like defence and regional security. \u201cSome 19 Australian agencies have made commitments to work with Thailand under this partnership on many areas of practical cooperation,\u201d she said. \u201cAs middle-sized countries, what I would say is we share many of the same aspirations for the region in which we live. Ultimately, Australia seeks, and I believe Thailand also seeks, a region that is peaceful and predictable.\u201d \u2013 via AAP   Updated at 5.08am GMT    4.29am    Partner of former Hawthorn player won\u2019t take part in \u2018culturally unsafe\u2019 AFL racism review The partner of a former Hawthorn player who says the football club demanded that she terminate a pregnancy says she will not take part in an AFL investigation into the claims. The Gunditjmara and Bunitj woman, known as Amy, released a statement on Wednesday morning saying that the investigation announced into claims made by First Nations players and their partners was founded on an \u201cunsafe process\u201d.   Updated at 4.34am GMT    4.15am    Prosecutors decline to comment on whether ATO whistleblower charges will be dropped Commonwealth prosecutors have declined to say whether they will drop some of the 24 charges laid against tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle. Boyle, who worked in the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s Adelaide office, blew the whistle in 2018 on its aggressive use of extraordinary powers to pursue debts, which he said was destroying the lives of small business owners and families. He is now facing 24 charges in the South Australian district court, including for allegedly recording private phone calls and making records of protected information. Boyle is attempting to use whistleblower protections to shield himself from prosecution, invoking the Public Interest Disclosure Act in a way that is largely unprecedented. At a hearing last month, prosecutors argued that Boyle was not entitled to PID act protection. But the prosecution\u2019s arguments during last month\u2019s hearing may have undermined some of the charges it will seek to bring against Boyle at trial. The court heard it may reconsider whether to proceed with some of the charges. The CDPP declined to comment on whether it planned to drop any charges against Boyle when approached by the Guardian.  The Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will not be making public comment on this matter as it is still currently before the Court.  Prosecutors have already reduced the number of charges Boyle is facing by a substantial number. When he was first charged in 2019, prosecutors brought 66 charges. That was reduced to 24 in 2021.  Updated at 4.34am GMT    4.05am    Queensland\u2019s system for screening people who work with children is \u201cre-traumatising\u201d for Indigenous people Queensland\u2019s blue card system is a \u201cmodern-day injustice\u201d for Indigenous people living in remote communities that should be reformed, a parliamentary report says. A parliamentary committee rejected a Katter\u2019s Australian party bill to overhaul the system to apply to work with children but has backed trials of some of the proposals. The committee chair, Peter Russo, said applying for blue cards can be \u201cexhausting and re-traumatising\u201d for Indigenous people due to intergenerational trauma, language barriers and complex ID requirements. Some face significant disadvantages in making online applications due to a lack of facilities or internet access, which contributes to inequity and delays.  Updated at 4.09am GMT    3.53am    As world decarbonises mining industry must put and end to corruption, conference hears The mining industry has been urged to do more to stamp out corruption, and respect land and water rights as it expands to meet global demand for critical minerals, AAP reports. Limiting global warming to below 2C is estimated to require a four-fold increase in the supply of minerals for clean energy technologies in coming decades. The chair of the global Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, has used her keynote address at a prestigious mining summit to call for more accountability. Amid the latest mining boom, she told the International Mining and Resources Conference in Sydney the key risk is around the awarding of mining licences, particularly when they are fast-tracked.  Not to put too fine a point on it, bribes may be used to influence decision-making or preferential treatment can be given to politically connected companies. The more ambitious the world is in its decarbonisation efforts, the more mining it\u2019s going to need.

There are 74 flood warnings in place across the state, revised down from more than 90 yesterday, and an evacuation order remains in place at Echuca. Despite the temporary relief in weather conditions, above average rainfall is expected to continue for the next six to eight weeks. The Murray Darling Basin Authority increased its daily water release at Hume Dam from 50GL to 75GL a day to free-up space at the dam on Tuesday. Emergency Victoria has warned residents in flood-affected areas are at risk of mosquito-borne diseases, water-borne diseases and illness relating to mould exposure. The environmental health coordinator for the City of greater Bendigo, Jason Barnes, said residents should remove stagnant water around the house, wear loose-fitting clothing and use insect repellents containing Deet or picaridin.   Updated at 3.40am GMT    3.14am    Uncertainty around AFLW grand final venue Hello everyone, this is Cait! A big thank you to Natasha for taking us through the morning. First up I have news about the AFWL grand final \u2013 at this point, no one seems sure where it will be held. Brisbane\u2019s minor premiership has created a potential grand final fixture dilemma for the AFLW, AAP has reported. The AFLW have been left with a possible headache should Brisbane reach the grand final, as the highest-ranked AFLW team has grand-final hosting rights. Metricon is already booked for non-football events on the 26-27 November grand final weekend, while the Lions\u2019 new Springfield facility appears unlikely to be ready in time. A Sheffield Shield game is scheduled for the Gabba from 1 December. Speaking at Monday\u2019s finals launch, the AFLW boss, Nicole Livingstone, said the grand final hosting rights \u201cdoes mean there\u2019s a bit of last-minute planning\u201d.  We won\u2019t make any announcements around [the] grand final right now. Because we still need to wait to see who\u2019s going to make the grand final. We\u2019ll continue to work with all stakeholders. We have a great relationship with cricket, so we\u2019ll continue to talk to cricket and also talk to the Queensland government [about the Gabba]. But I don\u2019t want to put the cart before the horse \u2013 we need to make sure that Brisbane are going to be the hosts.  Ikon Park and Marvel Stadium are the two options if a Melbourne team qualifies to host the grand final.   Updated at 3.22am GMT    3.04am    Thanks for your attention on what has certainly been a day of surprises with lions on the loose and snow in November. That\u2019s it from me as the wonderful Cait Kelly will take you through the rest of this afternoon!     2.54am    10 emergency warnings across New South Wales  Please check the latest updates through the links below:     Updated at 2.57am GMT    2.52am    $100m for emergency housing will help victims of domestic violence \u2013 PM A reporter asks: \u201cHow about people who are in crisis accommodation? We talk about domestic violence, but there are people currently sleeping in their cars.\u201d Albanese:  That\u2019s why we\u2019re putting $100m into additional emergency housing. That is why we are responding to this. Tonight, like every other night that\u2019s occurred over a number of years, there\u2019ll be women and children turned away from shelters because there\u2019s simply nowhere for them to go. We need that emergency housing, but we also need the uplift in social and affordable housing so that people can have some permanency. The government is acting on that.   Updated at 2.57am GMT    2.51am    The PM said he visited public housing residents in SA last year and saw their homes were in a \u201cstate of disrepair\u201d.  I\u2019m very pleased that now you have in Peter Malinauskas a state Labor government that also understands the importance of housing including the right of people to live with some dignity in their lives. This is something I\u2019m very passionate about. We have made some significant announcements and there\u2019ll be more to come.   Updated at 2.56am GMT    2.50am    \u2018We have a comprehensive plan for housing\u2019 \u2013 PM The PM has now been asked about the lack of public housing:  What we did in last week\u2019s budget was have a Housing Australia Future Fund, that will provide 30,000 additional social and affordable housing units over a five-year period in addition to that we announced our Housing Accord. This will encourage institutional investors to invest in affordable housing and is expected to deliver a million additional homes being constructed over a four-year period. That is federal government working with state government ministers, working with local government, and working with the private sector. In addition to that, we\u2019ll have our housing supply and affordability council established looking at ways in which planning laws can encourage investment in housing. In addition to that, we have allocated $100m for additional emergency housing so that women and children escaping domestic violence can have somewhere to go. We have a comprehensive plan for housing.    Updated at 3.01am GMT    2.49am   Albanese on skipping Cop27: 'I can\u2019t be in all places at once'  The PM is now defending his decision not to attend the major global climate conference COP, which starts this weekend:  I can\u2019t be in all places at once. It\u2019s as simple as that. If we could - if we could do that, then I\u2019d achieve it and I\u2019m sure, therefore, if I was going, people would say why aren\u2019t I attending budget. We had Parliament last week. This COP is one of implementation. It\u2019s not one of a new policy and program.  Australia will be represented by Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen and assistant minister Jenny McAllister. Albanese:  My criticism of the former Government was that they went to a conference, gave an empty speech to an empty room that didn\u2019t commit to anything new. The Glasgow Conference was about an increased contribution for 2030. The former government failed to do that and it probably would have been better off if they hadn\u2019t had gone at all because it just exposed to the world that Australia wasn\u2019t stepping up at a time when other global leaders were. Parliament is sitting at the same time that is scheduled with the leaders meeting and I\u2019ll be meeting all the leaders of the 20 largest economies in the world at the G20 in Bali.    Updated at 3.05am GMT    2.45am    Albanese says voice will lead to better outcomes for Indigenous people  What the voice to parliament does is just do two things. One \u2013 recognise Indigenous people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in our constitution. And, secondly, ensure that they\u2019ll be consulted and be able to put forward a view on policies that impact them. That\u2019s not only good manners, it will lead to better outcomes.   Updated at 2.50am GMT    2.45am    Albanese is now talking about the voice:  I would \u2013 I\u2019d encourage people to spend half an hour logging on to ABC iview, to listen to and watch Noel Pearson\u2019s powerful advocacy for a voice to parliament in the Boyer Lectures or read the Boyer Lectures online. I watched it the other night, and it was such a strong advocacy. I\u2019m very confident that Australians, when they have the opportunity to unite the nation, to do something that clearly identifies our confidence as a nation, our pride in the fact that we share this continent with the oldest continuous culture on earth, that they will want that represented in the nation\u2019s birth certificate which is what the constitution represents. And secondly \u2013 that we know that you\u2019ll get better practical outcomes, like any other endeavour, when you actually consult people who are directly affected.   Updated at 2.50am GMT    2.42am    PM says government examining all options on tax The PM, Anthony Albanese, has just spoken to the media. He was asked about former ACCC chair Rob Sims calling for an extra windfall profits tax and if he was willing to do more if regulation change isn\u2019t enough:  We have said we\u2019re prepared to examine further action which is exactly what we\u2019re doing between departments, talking to people in the energy sector as well. We understand that there are a range of proposals out there. We want to make sure that we get it right. We confronted when we came to office a circumstance where some were saying the lights wouldn\u2019t stay on over June, July. We fixed that. We then confronted a supply issue in gas. We fixed that as well with the heads of agreement that were agreed to cooperatively by the suppliers. What we need to do now is to make sure that we address the issue of price. The government has said we\u2019re examining all of the options, and we\u2019ll continue to do so over the next little period because we want to make sure that not just households, but that also businesses are able to access power without placing pressure on \u2013 on their ability to operate in a reasonable way.   Updated at 2.48am GMT    2.32am    Taylor says opposition supports voluntary code of conduct Karp:  I heard your point about the importance of supporting domestic gas supply but I didn\u2019t hear an answer on supporting a mandatory code of conduct.  Taylor:  We supported the voluntary code of conduct that is ready in place and at this point I don\u2019t know what is being proposed, it is just too hard to speculate that we will see what comes forward, but there is no question that the government needs to work closely with the gas producers, stop demonising them, work with them and find solutions with them. Is taking the code of conduct to the next step part of that? We will wait and see but at this stage we haven\u2019t seen anything tangible to comment.   Updated at 2.35am GMT    2.29am    Angus Taylor defends push for more domestic gas supplies to bring down prices Guardian Australia\u2019s Paul Karp questions Angus Taylor\u2019s claims that gas prices are all about supply at the National Press Club where he has finished his address and is now taking questions from journalists. Karp:  Increasing production does very little to decrease the price when it\u2019s mostly exported and Labor\u2019s heads of agreement have increased domestic supply and prices are still too high. So my question is would the Coalition support a mandatory code of conduct including regulation of price and secondly, if you want to pay down debt and deficit, would you support an increase in the PRRT [petroleum rent resource tax]?  Taylor:  On your point about supply, we did see what happens when you get more supply on the gas network, we saw the gas price drop to $5 a gigajoule stopping the key to this is very simple. It is only so much gas that can be exported from Australia, so much gas that can be exported from Australia, same in the United States. We are one of the biggest exporters alongside Qatar in the world so there is only so much you can export so if you can produce more than that and more than the domestic market needs you drive down the price of. That is what we have seen in the United States. The US government, Democrat administration, obviously, has supported making sure more supply out from under the ground, and we saw the results of that. The proof is in the pudding and you can see this by just looking at what Rod Sims says who has watched this market for a long time, reported on this market, reviewed this in the past and he has made exactly the same point so I think it is very clear. You ask a question about more tax. Our focus is to get the price down, not to tax more. The primary goal here right now has to be to get the price down in the key to that, it\u2019s economics 101. Get more supply in, that\u2019s how markets work.    Updated at 3.02am GMT    2.20am    Albanese focusing on budget polices rather than climate summit The prime minister has defended his decision not to attend a major global climate conference which starts this weekend. Anthony Albanese said he would focus on passing his government\u2019s policies during the final three parliament sitting weeks. Preparations are also underway for an upcoming trip to G20, Apec and the East Asia Summit. He will travel to Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia for nine days after the sitting week before returning for the last sitting fortnight of the year. He said:  So I have a very busy schedule of parliament, international conferences and then back to parliament, making sure our agenda gets through. I can\u2019t be in all places at once. I\u2019m sure if I was going people would be saying why wasn\u2019t I attending parliament.  The government will instead be represented by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the assistant minister, Jenny McAllister. The environment minister Tanya Plibersek will then travel to the COP biodiversity conference in Montreal in December after parliament wraps up for the year. Albanese said the COP27 summit in Egypt would be focused on the implementation of current commitments, not the establishment of new ones. He told reporters today:  We\u2019ve already advanced our changed policy.  Albanese said this stood in stark contrast to the former Morrison government, which was represented at the previous COP summit in Glasgow and didn\u2019t offer anything new. He said:  The Glasgow conference was about increased contributions for 2030. The former government failed to do that and it probably would\u2019ve been better off if they didn\u2019t go at all.  \u2013 from AAP  Updated at 2.23am GMT    2.08am    Department drew up brief for robodebt scheme in 2015 despite legal advice Former prime minister Scott Morrison wanted the Department of Human Services (DHS) to bring forward proposals to \u201cstrengthen the integrity\u201d of the welfare system, including a plan for what became the robodebt scheme, a royal commission has heard. Despite damning legal and policy\u2019 advice from within the Department of Social Services (DSS) in late 2014, the Department of Human Services drew up a brief for what became the scheme, as well as other compliance measures, in early 2015. The inquiry was told on Wednesday that DHS had indicated Morrison, who was then the social services minister, wanted the proposals worked up for the 2015 budget process. Senior counsel assisting, Justin Greggery, said that by late 2014 the compliance proposal had \u201cbecome part of the budget\u201d. Referring to documents seen by the commission, Greggery said that was because the DHS had said \u201cminister Morrison indicated he wants a number of the potential proposals\u201d brought forward for the budget process. The royal commission has not heard any evidence the legal or policy advice warning against the scheme reached Morrison, who has been granted leave to appear at the royal commission if he wishes. Under questioning, Anne Pulford, a lawyer at the DSS who had warned against the plan in late 2014, agreed Morrison\u2019s support for the proposal had limited the opportunity for \u201cconsidered legal advice\u201d. That was because it had been swept up in the budget process and there was a tight timeline for the plans to be sent to the Department of Finance, the inquiry was told. Greggery asked:  It appeared that the very tight timeframe and the pressure was coming from a clearance by minister Morrison to have a new policy proposal developed to the point that it might be submitted to the Department of Finance?  Pulford replied:  Correct.  The inquiry heard that while an initial draft proposal noted that what became the robodebt scheme needed \u201clegislative change\u201d to be administered, a later version said this was not needed. Officials within the department of social services raised internal concerns about this significant change in position. The inquiry heard that DSS officials noted \u201curgent advice\u201d was needed as to the \u201cstrategies ... cleared by minister Morrison for DHS to take forward as a [new policy proposal]\u201d. Greggery said:  And what we know now from the benefit of hindsight is that this particular proposal did become including in the 2015-16 budget ... as the strengthening welfare integrity system.  While the DSS officials noted some of the assumptions used to form Pulford\u2019s advice had \u201cchanged\u201d, the royal commission heard that officials only two days to review their advice. The overall strengthening welfare integrity system plan was expected to save $1.2bn. The inquiry heard that one of the measures was \u201cbroadly consistent\u201d with the proposal that Pulford provided damning legal advice only a few months earlier. Pulford\u2019s evidence continues.  Updated at 2.13am GMT    1.57am    World Ballet Day gives behind the scene look at Australian Ballet If you\u2019ve ever wondered how the Australian Ballet manage their gravity defying feats of athleticism, you can get a sneak peak at what goes on behind the curtain today. To mark World Ballet Day, the Australian Ballet is live-streaming rehearsals as well as other behind the scenes content from Melbourne. This year\u2019s celebration is particularly special for the Australian Ballet because it marks 60 years ago to the day that the company gave their first ever performance.   If you\u2019re still hungry for more ballet content, you can also check out this fascinating interview with one of the ballet\u2019s newest principal artists Callum Linnane. Linane opens up about not only the technical demands of being a dancer, but also his conception of himself as an artists and the importance of being open to the influence of other art forms on his dancing.   Updated at 2.22am GMT    1.45am    Labor budget not addressing the source of inflation: Angus Taylor The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, is giving the national press club address today. It is all about the cost of living. The former energy minister has been working on laying the ground work to blame the Labor government (which has only been in power since May) for economic struggles people are feeling at the moment. His speech is another brick in that wall:  The economy is, at a macro level, in a very strong position. The Australian economy is fundamentally resilient. Just two years ago, we were staring down the prospect of permanent business closures, tens of thousands of deaths and an unemployment rate of 15%. Today, we have more businesses, strong terms of trade, record commodity prices, economic growth over 3% and record low unemployment. Not every decision during Covid was perfect. But Australia\u2019s economic recovery is a testament to the Coalition\u2019s economic management. The Coalition left Labor with a strong economy \u2013 a rapidly improving budget position in far better shape than most thought possible, even a short time ago.  Taylor says the budget Labor handed down is not addressing the source of inflation, which he says is now eating away at Australia\u2019s gains.  Updated at 1.49am GMT    1.40am    \u2018Ditch Danmobile\u2019 aims to highlight 4,000 ICU beds not delivered: Victorian Coalition Speaking of the Victorian Liberals\u2019 \u201cDitch Danmobile\u201d as they call it, this is what the opposition have to say about the vehicle\u2019s purpose:  The Liberal party\u2019s Ditch Danmobile has today embarked on a month-long mission in search of the missing 4,000 ICU beds. On 1 April 2020, Daniel Andrews promised an extra 4,000 ICU beds for Victoria. Over two years later, not a single one of these promised new beds has been delivered.   The statement from the Victorian campaign headquarters went on to outline broader problems with the state\u2019s health system including ballooning surgery waiting lists, an overloaded triple-zero service and tents being set up outside major hospitals for patients. The Liberals say that by contrast they have prioritised health over infrastructure in their election promises. The statement also pointed readers to follow \u201cthe adventures of the Ditch Danmobile\u201d via a dedicated twitter page.  Updated at 1.48am GMT    1.27am    Victorian Coalition says it will not be lectured by Labor on political advertising Victoria\u2019s opposition have used the first day of the state\u2019s election campaign to announce a water bill. Cost of living will be a major issue at this month\u2019s election. The opposition said the five-year freeze on water bill service charges would save Victorian households $100 a year. Opposition leader Matthew Guy said the measure was \u201cmodest\u201d but \u201crealistic\u201d:  It can be achieved and we can help average Victorian families.  Guy was also questioned about the opposition\u2019s \u201cDitch Dan\u201d vintage ambulance to be driven around the state during the campaign to highlight pressures in the health sector. During a heated press conference, Guy said he would not be lectured by Labor or the union movement on political advertising. But Guy would not reveal if the opposition had sought permission from the Department of Health to use the fake vehicle \u2013 as required under the state\u2019s ambulance legislation.   Updated at 1.31am GMT    1.25am   Victorian Coalition opposes families of Islamic State fighters being repatriated to state  Victoria\u2019s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, says he would not support the families of Islamic State fighters being repatriated to Victoria if he was elected premier next month. On Saturday, four women and their 13 children \u2013 relatives of IS fighters \u2013 arrived in Sydney under a commonwealth scheme. They are expected to be among 60 women and children repatriated from northern Syria. Nine newspapers have reported a separate contingent is expected to arrive in Victoria, but not until after the state election on 26 November. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has sought to distance himself from the federal program while Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has stressed that only those of the lowest risk category are brought to Australia. Speaking to reporters on day one of the Victorian election campaign, Guy said he did not support similar cohorts travelling to the state:  I probably wouldn\u2019t now that we\u2019ve seen a little bit more detail of what\u2019s coming into Victoria.  Anthony Albanese has denied that sending families to NSW before Victoria \u2013 where the state will head to the polls later this month \u2013 is politically motivated.  Updated at 1.29am GMT    1.20am    Opposition calls on defence to remove bureaucratic hurdles to reach recruitment targets Andrew Hastie, the opposition\u2019s defence spokesperson, has called on the Australian defence force to remove bureaucratic hurdles \u201cimposed by risk-averse gatekeepers\u201d in order to meet ambitious recruitment targets. There is a bipartisan goal of increasing the size of the ADF by 18,500 people by 2040, or net growth of 1,000 people a year. But Hastie said the job market was \u201ctough\u201d at present and Defence in recent years had only managed net growth of 300 people. Hastie said the ADF needed a message that appealed to \u201cyoung hearts and minds searching for purpose, emphasising the service ethos\u201d including \u201cduty, honour and country\u201d. He said the government must also speed up the process of entering the ADF:  Last year, as assistant minister for Defence, I discovered that it took 292 days* from first contact to recruit training. The Australian Public Service was achieving the same milestone in less than half the time, at around 140 days \u2013 which is still a long time. Far too much time is wasted; we need to accelerate the process or good people will be lost to other sectors of the economy.  Hastie said it was important to \u201cremove barriers to service \u2013 often bureaucratic ones imposed by risk-averse gatekeepers\u201d:  I\u2019ve met and heard from too many kids who get turned away because they\u2019ve had a shoulder injury from footy, a food allergy or were medicated for ADHD in their childhood. All talented kids, motivated and open to grow \u2013 yet turned away because of risk culture. Not every job of the future requires the fitness of a fighter pilot or the endurance of an infantry soldier. We need to move beyond the one-size-fits-all model and select kids who might not tick all the boxes but who can get the job done, and then some.  *Figure corrected from 300 days in final version of speech.  Updated at 1.59am GMT    1.18am    \u2018The spectre of nuclear attack looms over Europe like a dark cloud\u2019: Hastie Here\u2019s what the Coalition\u2019s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said today about the strategic circumstances \u2013 including some very pointed language about the security pact between Solomon Islands and China that was reached prior to the Australian election:  Abroad, the war in Ukraine burns away, no closer to the end than when it started, and now the spectre of nuclear attack looms over Europe like a dark cloud. Closer to home, the People\u2019s Republic of China concluded its 20th Communist party congress last month, with President Xi consolidating his absolute power and control over the party and the people. It caps a turbulent year thus far \u2013 if not a successful one, for authoritarian regimes \u2013 where Xi and Putin remain committed to their no-limits partnership; Russia brutally seized parts of Ukraine; Chinese rockets streaked across the skies of Taiwan; and Chinese influence has projected deep into the Pacific Island chain, ensnaring the heart of at least one national leader. The Sogavare-Beijing security pact is a startling reminder that there is a growing geopolitical contest taking place on our front doorstep. And, if you\u2019re an observer of Western democracies, we don\u2019t seem to be faring all that well\u2014with the United Kingdom now onto their third prime minister in four months. You\u2019d be right to wonder about the resilience of our democratic institutions in these times.   Updated at 1.22am GMT    1.16am    Australia must build strike capabilities before nuclear subs are ready: Hastie The Australian government must prepare for the risk that China may attempt to take Taiwan by force sooner than the nuclear-powered submarines are ready, the Coalition\u2019s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, has said. The Aukus partnership with the US and the UK was reached under the former Coalition government and heavily promoted by Scott Morrison in the lead up to the election - but Hastie said in a speech today that Australia needed to boost its military capability sooner. Hastie, one of the Coalition\u2019s more hawkish members, said the former US Commander of the Indo-Pacific, Admiral Phil Davidson, had \u201csounded the ship\u2019s klaxon 18 months ago when he warned that China may attempt to take Taiwan by force within six years, by 2027\u201d. Hastie also pointed to recent comments by the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, that \u201cBeijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline.\u201d Hastie told a Business News politics and policy breakfast in Perth:  Only in the last fortnight, Chief of US Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said China could move on Taiwan as early as this year, or next. The window is closing fast. These are considered words. We must take them seriously. We won\u2019t have nuclear submarines in the water by 2027. So how are we hedging against the risk of conflict arriving sooner rather than later? That\u2019s what Stephen Smith and Sir Angus Houston are now considering in the Defence Strategic Review. I don\u2019t want to discuss particulars here today except to make clear that we need to build strike capabilities that can hold an adversary at risk beyond the archipelago to our north. Strike bombers; precision guided missiles; and, unmanned autonomous vehicles\u2014in the skies and in the seas below.  Hastie said the final report would be completed in March, but he understood an interim version would be provided to the government this week. He said he was \u201chopeful for good outcomes\u201d but argued that last week\u2019s budget \u201cdoes not inspire confidence\u201d because inflation was depleting Defence\u2019s purchasing power. While Labor has committed to annual defence spending of 2% of economic output, Hastie said it \u201cmust be well above\u201d that benchmark. Hastie said the Australian government had \u201ca moral obligation to the Australian people to build and maintain a strong deterrent to any regional aggressor, to show that there is a great cost for any unilateral military adventurism\u201d.     1.13am   You can slide into my DMs any time, Fatman: Albanese  So four years after Fatman Scoop became an Auspol meme, he was back. Invitations were once again thrown around. Surely that\u2019s the end of it? No. Because this morning, on Melbourne radio station Fox FM, Fatman was back. For \u2026 reasons. Scoop:  Hello? Hello? Hello, sir.  PM:  Yes?  Scoop:  How you doing? This is Fatman Scoop.  PM:  Ah, Fatman again.  Scoop:  Yes, sir. I was walking around and I can hear the speakers in here. And I hear you on the radio. I\u2019m here working, doing interviews. I\u2019ve been calling your people for three weeks, what\u2019s going on here, sir?  PM:  Mate, I\u2019m in. I\u2019ve done a little video for your gigs that are coming up.  Scoop:  Sir, I love you. I respect you. But I need you to come down and DJ with me, sir. Be with me with the people. Here\u2019s the thing, and then I find out just now that you\u2019re going to be in Melbourne. What\u2019s the address? I need to come down and see you, sir.  Having won the love and respect of a man who had people throwing their hands up in clubs 19 years ago \u2013 meaning children conceived to that song are now able to legally enter clubs and put their own hands up \u2013 the prime minister invited him to a Melbourne University economic conference. Isaac Freeman III has bigger things on his mind though. One being whether or not he could get an Uber there. The other, when was he going to get the prime minister\u2019s private phone number. Fatman Scoop no longer wants to go through the prime minister\u2019s \u201cpeople\u201d. Scoop:  I need like \u2013 do you have an Instagram? Can I slide in your DMs? You\u2019ve got to give me an option here, sir, because this is not working.  PM:  You can slide into my DMs any time, Fatman.  Scoop:  Here\u2019s the thing. But this is not a threat sir. Listen, I\u2019m supposed to be sleeping because I\u2019m on American time. But if I have to come down there to get this done, sir, I\u2019ll be down there.  Host:  Can I just give you some context, you\u2019ve been asking our prime minister for months, since August, to DJ with you at Fridayz Live this Friday at Rod Laver.  Scoop:  Fridayz Live, yes! I\u2019ve been asking the man, and here\u2019s the thing. This is not a threat, sir ... if you do not do this, I\u2019m getting my Australian citizenship and I\u2019m running against you. I\u2019m out of here. I\u2019ll talk to you later.  PM:  I hate to give you the big tip, but I think I can possibly stop that happening.  So there you have it. Please welcome our next prime minister, DJ Fatman Scoop. \u201cBe Faithful\u201d is now the national anthem. Faith Evans will be the new head of state. Parliament will be a Sunday sesh, with important sessions to be held on RnB Fridays.  Updated at 1.20am GMT    1.08am    \u2018I have a pattern of dealing with Prime Ministers in this country\u2019: Fatman Scoop For completely inexplicable reasons, US DJ Fatman Scoop continues to have input into Australian politics. It all started when Scott Morrison used one of his tracks in a 2018 parliament stunt, getting his backbench to put their hands up to questions he asked. His social media team then cut that footage up and put it to Scoop\u2019s 2003 club banger, Be Faithful, which asks people to \u201cput their hands up\u201d. What the social media team missed were the lyrics about \u201cchickenheads\u201d \u2013 a reference to fellatio and the more explicit lines \u201cwho\u2019s fucking tonight\u201d.  Morrison had to apologise for using the track, Scoop was all, \u201cwhat are you talking about, it\u2019s a fun banger\u201d, there were invitations thrown around and then, thankfully, the world moved on. But Australian FM radio stations did not. And in August, Brisbane FM radio station B105 had Anthony Albanese on the line, and for reasons known only to the galaxy-brained among us, brought Fatman Scoop into the conversation. Here\u2019s a section of that transcript: Host:  Can we please bring into the studio: Fatman Scoop?  Fatman Scoop:  Hey, what\u2019s up everybody? How you guys feeling?  Albanese:  Hey, good.  Scoop: [singing]  Albanese \u2026  Albanese:  Fatman Scoop does the Eagles.  Scoop:  How are you, sir?  Albanese:  I am very well.  Scoop:  Listen, I have a pattern of dealing with prime ministers in this country. So you\u2019re now the second prime minister that I\u2019m on the phone with.  Albanese:  Who was the first?  Scoop:  Scomo, not working out so well. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna answer my phone calls right now. Doesn\u2019t feel like the right time.

The 1.02 million metro viewers (of which 528,000 were in Melbourne) represents less than half the 2.17 million viewers who tuned in in 2013. The figure just above 1 million continues the declines from 1.21 million viewers in 2021, and 1.41 million in 2020. The last time viewers topped 2 million was in 2015.  Updated at 12.58am GMT    12.45am   Andrew Wilkie welcomes changes to gambling ads but calls for government to 'go much further'  The independent MP Andrew Wilkie is speaking in Hobart following the government\u2019s changes to gambling ads. He says he fully supports the changes, but urges them to go even further.  That the federal government is going to crack down on online gambling advertising is good news. The fact that the online gambling companies will be required to ditch that, frankly, pretty useless \u2018Gamble Responsibly\u2019 message and substitute that with a number of more effective messages that will change and cycle \u2026 through the year, that\u2019s good. That the warnings have to be more obvious at the end with bigger text, that the voiceovers need to be slower and more deliberate and that also people will be steered towards help services if they have a gambling addiction. I think this is good news. It\u2019s unexpected news and it will go some small way to making sports betting, online gambling, just that little bit safer. So I fully support them.  This is how he thinks the government needs to go further:  \u2026 It is technically feasible and at little cost for all of the Australian online gambling companies to be linked in real-time so when an online gambler reaches their daily limit, it prevents them swiping to another app and running up another hefty total. Talking more broadly, too, there\u2019s the issue of gambling generally. I have been confronted by countless members of the community over the years who, frankly, are sick and tired of being bombarded by gambling advertisements.   Updated at 12.49am GMT    12.34am   Victorian Labor promises lower regional public transport in line with city fares  The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced that if re-elected, the Labor government will bring the cost of regional public transport in line with metropolitan fares. The commitment would see a daily V/Line ticket capped at $9.20 for a full fare or $4.60 for a concession. Currently, regional fares are calculated based on the distance travelled. A daily return fare from Bendigo to Melbourne costs up to $68.80, Shepparton to Melbourne up to $53.60, Ballarat to Melbourne up to $45.69 and Geelong to Melbourne up to $27.60. Speaking at train manufacturer Alstom\u2019s factory in Ballarat East, the premier said:  It\u2019s about equity and fairness. It\u2019s about a fair go. It\u2019s about doing something meaningful about the cost of living, but it\u2019s also about adding extra services on brand new trains made by Victorians.  The government will also spend $600m on 23 new three-car VLocity trains and $207m to increase the frequency of weekend services on major train lines in regional Victoria. The announcement comes after the Coalition opposition announced half-price regional fares and a $2 cap on a daily metropolitan fare.

Updated at 12.32am GMT    12.16am    \u2018Gay panic defence\u2019 in Crimes Act only removed eight years ago, inquiry hears More on the opening statement from senior counsel assisting Peter Gray at the inquiry into the unsolved deaths of LGBTQ+ people in NSW. Gray goes on to say those 2018 reports (Acon and Parrabell) came as the result \u201cof a long-term building up of concern in many parts of the community about the violence, including homicides, committed against LGBTQ+ people, especially in the 1970s, 80s and 90s\u201d.  The second half of the 20th century was a period of rapid social change on many fronts. In particular context of which this inquiry is concerned, some of the well-documented reports are the following. As late as 1958, the then NSW police commissioner Colin Delaney described homosexuality as, quote, \u2018the greatest social mania in Australia\u2019. A year earlier in 1957, a report in the UK had recommended the decriminalisation of homosexual conduct between consenting adult males in private. In 1967, 10 years after that report, such decriminalisation was implemented initially in Wales and then later in all of the UK. In 1969, the Stonewall riots in New York attracted worldwide publicity and attention. In 1970, the campaign against moral prosecution was formed in Australia. In 1975, homosexual conduct was decriminalised in South Australia. The first Australian state to take that step. In 1978, the first Mardi Gras was held in Sydney. In 1984, homosexual conduct was decriminalised in New South Wales. And later still in WA, 1989, Queensland, 1991 and Tasmania, 1997. By 1984, HIV/Aids had begun to have its devastating effects in Australia and around the world. In 1987, the Grim Reaper media campaign was given saturation coverage. And it was not until 2014, eight years ago, that amendments to the Crimes Act in this state effectively abolished a defence known colloquially as the \u2018gay panic defence,\u2019 or \u2018homosexual advance defence\u2019 whereby an accused might assert that although he had killed or injured victim, he could only have done so because the victim had made a so-called homosexual advance.   Updated at 12.30am GMT    12.05am    NSW gay hate crimes inquiry \u2018first of its kind anywhere in the world\u2019 We mentioned on the blog earlier that the first sitting of a landmark inquiry into the unsolved deaths of LGBTQ+ people in NSW was taking place today. The special commission of inquiry into hate crimes, led by Justice John Sackar, was established in April after it was recommended by a 2019 parliamentary inquiry. The opening statements are now being presented, with senior counsel assisting Peter Gray first up outlining the scope of the inquiry:  The special commission is the first of its kind anywhere in the world. The inquiry carried out by the parliamentary committee had followed on from the publication of two important reports in 2018. Firstly a report by the Aids Council of New South Wales entitled \u2018In pursuit of truth and justice\u2019, published in May of 2018. I will refer to that as the Acon report. And a report concerning initial police Strike Force Parrabell report, published a month later in June 2010. I will refer to that as the Parrabell report. Both those reports in different ways have looked at 88 deaths in New South Wales between 1976 and 2000 where gay hate or anti-gay bias or sexuality or gender bias had been relevant factors. Less than half of those 88 deaths were regarded as unsolved. However, the Acon report and the Parrabell report \u2026 express different views as to what that proportion of unsolved cases actually was. Acon considered about 30 of the 88 unsolved while Parrabell regarded 23 as unsolved.   The inquiry is being livestreamed, and you can watch it here.  Updated at 12.14am GMT    11.53pm   Lions breached containment fence but zoo does not know how  The Taronga spokesperson faces questions from the media and is pressed for further details on how the lions got out:  They did breach the containment fence. We don\u2019t have the exact details of how and why that occurred. That is very much a focus of our incident response and the review that will be conducted now.  The spokesperson goes on to say the zoo has multiple levels of security with more than one containment fence:  The second containment fence is a containment fence for people, to have that safe barrier between them and the lion exhibit. But I would remind everyone that Taronga Zoo itself has its own safety perimeter fence. So at no time did the lions exit that area or exit Taronga Zoo.   Updated at 11.58pm GMT    11.45pm   Lion cub tranquillised as Taronga reviews how lions exited enclosure  We\u2019re hearing from Taronga Zoo for the first time since we learned five lions escaped their exhibit this morning. The spokesperson said the situation was brought \u201cunder control within minutes,\u201d but that a \u201cfull review\u201d is under way to confirm exactly how the lions were able to exhibit their main exhibit. The spokesperson says:  An emergency situation occurred this morning at Taronga Zoo, Sydney. Five lions \u2013 one adult and four cubs \u2013 were located outside of their main enclosure at 6.30am. The lions were observed in a small area adjacent to the main lion exhibit where a six-foot fence separated them from the rest of the zoo. The zoo has very strict safety protocols in place for such an incident and immediate action was taken. All persons on site were moved to safe zones. Four of the lions calmly made their way back into their main exhibit and dens and one lion cub was safely tranquillised. All animals are now safe in their back-of-house exhibit and are being closely monitored. All zoo staff responded and acted swiftly and procedures and processes were followed as they should have been. As a result, the situation was under control within minutes. We have received video footage and confirmed that it was less than 10 minutes between the lions exiting their main exhibit and the full emergency response being enacted. This is a significant incident and a full review is now under way to confirm exactly how the lions were able to exit their main exhibit.

The secretary of the Victorian Ambulance Union, Danny Hill, has shared the law on Twitter, which states you cannot \u201cuse the words \u2018ambulance service\u2019 or any name, title or description to imply an association with an ambulance service\u201d without permission. The 1970s-style ambulance clearly is labelled as such in images shared on social media.

Cartwright has strongly rejected the notion that his appointment to the senior UK trade role was a \u201cclassic example\u201d of a \u201cjobs for mates scenario\u201d after he was asked to apply for the role late by then deputy premier John Barilaro. He said:  My qualifications for this role are unable to be challenged. I\u2019m crystal-clear that three highly impressive senior independent panel members decided that I was the most suitable person for this role based on merit, and given my background I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that my appointment can be categorised as \u2018jobs for mates\u2019 because I don\u2019t have any politicians that are mates, I\u2019ve never been part of any political party.  He rejected the assertion and said he was \u201coffended by it\u201d.  Updated at 11.13pm GMT    10.56pm   Welfare advocates pan NDIS pilot for failing to listen to participants  Welfare advocates have panned a pilot to be introduced by the Albanese government that will connect national disability insurance scheme participants with a disability employment services provider. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, will today announce a pilot that will start next year in five locations. But the Antipoverty Centre panned the announcement, accusing the government of failing to listen to criticism of the disability employment services scheme from within the disability community. Antipoverty Centre spokesperson Kristin O\u2019Connell said:  The NDIS is far from perfect but increasing the involvement of disability employment services (Des) providers can only make things worse. Des has been failing disabled people for as long as it\u2019s existed. Pushing a failed industry on people discriminated against and excluded from the labour market because of our disabilities won\u2019t get us jobs, but it will expose us to harm.  Jay Coonan of the Antipoverty Centre, who also co-authored a submission into Des for the peak body People With Disability Australia, said:  The answer to employment barriers is not funnelling money to these failed services, but to tackle the discrimination in the labour market \u2013 inflexible employers, unsuitable conditions and a society hostile to disabled people.

Seems not all the media get such attention \u2026  Updated at 10.53pm GMT    10.43pm    Tight security at international mining meet in Sydney Perhaps it\u2019s a sign of the sensitivity around mining\u2019s social licence that the International Mining and Resources Conference in Sydney has attracted lots of security this morning:  There are multiple screenings of attenders and even sniffer dogs.  A handful of protesters staged a small gathering but say the main protest won\u2019t be until Friday. (Presumably the security won\u2019t be relaxed in the meantime.) Much of the conference will be about the importance of mining in the transition away from fossil fuels (though not quite in those terms).  Strategic and sustainable. An asset more relevant than ever before.  That\u2019s the slogan greeting a long line of attenders. Sustainable seems to be oxymoronic when it comes to digging up finite resources \u2026 so perhaps there\u2019s a session on recycling. (Or maybe not.)  Updated at 10.47pm GMT    10.39pm    A bit more info on the story we\u2019ve been following about the five lions which escaped from their enclosure at Taronga Zoo this morning, but have since been returned without any injury to staff or guests. Taronga Zoo have told us that they will be open as per usual today. Schoolchildren have already arrived for their excursion today, ABC News have shown. A press conference is expected within the hour with more details on how the escape occurred, which remains unknown. In the interests of full journalistic disclosure, I was a year 10 work experience student at Taronga Zoo (but the primates and ungulates division rather than the carnivores division, so no conflict of interest).

Unsurprisingly, the bus features the party\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cDoing What Matters\u201d and images of the premier, Daniel Andrews, with nurses and tradies. Today, Andrews is joined on the bus with his wife, Catherine, the deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, and the transport minister, Ben Carroll. We\u2019ll be heading to Ballarat East for what I assume will be a transport-related announcement. Ballarat East falls within the seat of Eureka, which is held by Labor MP, Michaela Settle, on a very comfortable 9.6% margin. I\u2019ll keep you updated throughout the day.    Updated at 10.38pm GMT    10.28pm    NSW agent general to the UK had \u2018open and frank\u2019 discussion about pay with John Barilaro, inquiry hears Much of the questioning at the inquiry this morning has focused on the shift from the frontrunning candidate Paul Webster to the eventual appointment of Cartwright into the position. Earlier in the week, Webster gave evidence that he \u201cwasn\u2019t shocked\u201d about missing out on the prestigious position, despite emails showing he was the best candidate for the job. Cartwright insisted he was never told that another suitable candidate had been found for the position by the time he said he was asked to enter the recruitment process in February 2021 by then deputy premier John Barilaro. Cartwright said he had always been upfront about how much he expected and wanted to be paid:  When the deputy premier first asked me to consider the role back in early February, he and I had a very open and frank discussion about my circumstances. I have been on a package over $800,000 for some years and I\u2019ve made financial commitments accordingly.   Updated at 10.34pm GMT    10.21pm    NSW agent general to the UK describes negotiations over pay with Investment NSW chief The New South Wales agent general to the UK, Stephen Cartwright, has completed his 20-minute opening statement. Appearing before the parliamentary committee from London, the statement detailed how he was first approached for the role, by then deputy premier John Barilaro in early February 2021. He said:  The deputy premier asked me if I might be interested in the UK agent general role. I was taken by complete surprise by his question because I had not heard much about the role since it was announced.  Cartwright explained that he then interviewed for the role in late February and his application progressed to a panel interview at the end of March. He said he was initially told he could expect a salary package of $600,000 as well as money to rent a well-located three bedroom home for him and his family, travel between London and Sydney and contributions to UK school fees. In subsequent weeks, Cartwright and officials went back and forth over the package leading to a meeting with the then Investment NSW chief executive Amy Brown over what he believed to be a $56,000 shortfall in his expected remuneration. He said:  [Brown] admonished me for requesting in my email the previous day that we take the matter to her boss or higher, suggesting that by requesting this, I was acting in bad faith. I denied that I was acting in bad faith ...  In the end, Ms Brown refused to escalate the matter and I simply had to accept the loss. I did not take it any further with her boss or any minister.  Cartwright also detailed issues he said he faced setting up the London office including issues procuring desks. At the close of his statement, Cartwright said that once he was in London he texted the then minister Stuart Ayres explaining the differences between what other people in similar positions were being paid in the UK. He was later offered extra money for rent and then \u201csigned the variation to my employment contract on the 16th of June, 2022, and moved into a small two-bedroom flat immediately\u201d.  Updated at 10.30pm GMT    10.12pm   Taronga Zoo says lions returned to their enclosure with no one injured  Five lions escaped their enclosure this morning, but have now been returned, with no staff or guests injured, Taronga Zoo have confirmed. In a statement, Taronga Zoo said:  An emergency situation occurred this morning at Taronga Zoo Sydney when five lions were located outside their enclosure. The Zoo has strict safety protocols in place for such an incident. All persons on site were moved to safe zones and there are no injuries to guests or staff. All animals are now in their exhibit where they are being closely monitored. The Zoo will be open as normal today. Further details will be provided when possible.    Updated at 11.05pm GMT    10.07pm    Reports Taronga Zoo lions have been contained ABC journalist Lara Hyams reports that the lions have been contained:  An alarm was set off just after 7am this morning. Some of the details are quite scant at the moment, but what we believe to have happened is that the lions have escaped their enclosure. We\u2019re still unsure how that managed to happen or if any staff were present at the time. But that has triggered an emergency response. What we know now, based on some of the vision that we have been seeing from the helicopter above, is that that\u2019s triggered an entire police operation. Emergency services have been sent there to assist in trying to make sure those lions are contained. We do believe now that the lions \u2013 they\u2019re actually contained in their enclosure and they have been accounted for.    Updated at 11.06pm GMT    9.54pm   Police operation under way at Taronga Zoo with reports lions are on the loose  The Today Show are reporting that four lions escaped their enclosure at Sydney\u2019s Taronga Zoo, but acknowledge the reports are unconfirmed.

Updated at 9.57pm GMT    9.44pm   'Australian first': Respect at work website launches with 'cutting edge' resources  As of last week, all legislative changes recommended by Kate Jenkins\u2019 landmark Respect at Work report are now before the parliament. One of those recommendations (the positive duty recommendation) puts responsibility on workplaces and bosses to create an environment that prevents sexual harassment and discrimination. To create this change, the bill proposes a 12-month education process before the compliance arm starts. Jenkins, Australia\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner, told ABC Radio the launch of the Respect at Work website today marks the start of a \u201cproactive education for employers\u201d over the next year:  In practice, employers have been taking action on sexual harassment, but most of that attention has been towards what you do after it happened. The change in the law really is to reorient the attention \u2026 to stop the sexual harassment. For the next 12 months, the commission is funded to do education to ensure that workplaces, and particularly recognising small workplaces and small business, are informed about what that would look like, what they can do, and they\u2019re really up and running. And the website that we\u2019re launching today, which is www.respectatwork.gov.au/, has a whole lot of resources, training information for organisations as well as for workers. We\u2019re really leading the way, I think, globally, but certainly in an Australian first to have one place that everyone can go to get some really great cutting-edge and up-to-date resources, so that we\u2019re setting workplaces and workers up for success.   Updated at 9.50pm GMT    9.40pm    Energy price rises dwarfed by other cost-of-living impacts If you read only headlines and listened only to political sound bites, you\u2019d think rising energy costs were the most pressing and alarming assaults on household finances. While not insignificant, it might surprise you to know that more expensive gas and electricity are not biting into budgets as much as, say, rising debt costs.  Keeping these things in perspective is not easy. Similarly, it\u2019s fair to say that the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, is pretty careful in the language that he uses. So, while he did say yesterday in Hobart that the RBA was prepared to hike its cash rate by another 50 basis points at a time if necessary to quash inflation, he was also prepared to sit tight if necessary. \u201cIf the situation requires us to hold steady for a while, we will do that,\u201d Lowe said ... in apparently the first outing of such a phrase.  Updated at 9.44pm GMT    9.27pm    NSW agent general to the UK appears before Barilaro inquiry The New South Wales agent general to the UK, Stephen Cartwright, is appearing before an inquiry into the appointment of John Barilaro as senior trade and investment commissioner to the Americas. While the inquiry began as a specific probe into the former deputy premier\u2019s appointment, it has since expanded to look at the appointments of other senior trade and investment commissioners, including Cartwright. Cartwright is starting his appearance with an extensive statement, outlining his working experience and how he believes he was selected for the role.  I am not, nor have I ever been, a member or affiliated with or associated with any political party, other than indirectly when I was a member of the miners\u2019 union when I worked in underground coal mines for five years during the 1980s.  He said he had been successful in the private sector prior to his appointment to the public service.  I would estimate that my personal and business contributions to the NSW government have been in excess of $30 million in terms of payroll tax and stamp duties.  Cartwright said while he was the head of the NSW business chamber he \u201cregularly engaged with public servants, as well as with premiers, treasurers, ministers, shadow ministers\u201d.

On the topic of the respect at work recommendations poised to pass for parliament, ABC Radio asks Gallagher for her response to concerns raised by lawyers. They say that a provision forcing both parties to pay their own costs, regardless of who wins, will actually discourage victims from pursuing justice through the court. Is the government considering the amendment that is proposed by Monique Ryan? Gallagher:  I haven\u2019t been involved in the negotiations around that \u2026 my understanding is we are implementing all recommendations of that report, but we remain open to sensible discussions.   Updated at 9.25pm GMT    9.09pm    Campaign against IR changes less important than \u2018the right thing to do\u2019: Gallagher ABC Radio asks Gallagher if the government is concerned about a funded campaign against the government on the IR bill, considering the published warnings from business that they are prepared to do so. Gallagher:  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising that there are people who aren\u2019t supportive of this legislation. For the government, it\u2019s really about what is the right thing to do. How \u2026 we make sure that we\u2019re finding that balance and that we\u2019re getting the bargaining system working for working people, which is the problem that we are trying to deal with here, particularly with my minister for women\u2019s hat on \u2013 some of the issues that we\u2019ve seen in those industries that are dominated by women [are] about where bargaining has failed, and industrial relations protections haven\u2019t provided the environment that those workforces need to have a secure, well paid job. I think that the impact of the campaign against the changes is less important than trying to focus on what the right thing to do is and we know that in this area, bargaining is not working and something needs to happen.   Updated at 9.13pm GMT    9.05pm    Engagement with crossbench and business necessary on industrial relations bill amid concerns: Gallagher The senate crossbench has been calling for more time to scrutinise the government\u2019s omnibus industrial relations bill. ABC Radio asks Gallagher why the crossbench shouldn\u2019t get more time to look at the bill. Gallagher says:  There\u2019s a committee process under way and that\u2019s important. I have no doubt the minister continues to talk with the Senate crossbench on how to navigate this bill through, but I think what the government is saying is this is a priority for us. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that the government would want to see these sensible amendments passed by the end of the year.  Karvelas:  Business is telling us that the provisions in your bill go well beyond low-paid sectors, and due to the common interest test, could apply to any business, and only those with fewer than 50 employees can opt out. Are you willing to look at that provision in the bill given businesses is saying that this is going to drag a lot of businesses into potentially multi employer negotiations?  Gallagher:  My understanding is there are some safeguards in the bill, so that tests would have to be met so I understand they are the more controversial parts of the bill, I have no doubt they will be looked at through the senate inquiry, as they should be. Engagement with the crossbench, engagement with business which is what we\u2019ve been doing, since the election is the right path, and I know the minister\u2019s aiming that.   Updated at 9.09pm GMT    8.55pm    Budget forecast doesn\u2019t predict wage price spiral: finance minister The Reserve Bank says it wants to avoid a wage price spiral. Does Gallagher think the government\u2019s policies are risking that?  The bank obviously will keep looking at that \u2026 we\u2019re not seeing that, the budget in its forecast doesn\u2019t predict that.   Updated at 8.58pm GMT    8.53pm    \u2018Work is under way\u2019 on regulatory intervention to lower energy prices: Gallagher Karvelas asks Gallagher if regulatory intervention to lower energy prices is the only option the government has to ease the cost of living without pushing up inflation. Gallagher says:  Looking at the regulatory arrangements is our first inclination. That work is under way, I can\u2019t give you a timeframe on the completion of that.   Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.50pm    Cost-of-living relief \u2018always on the agenda\u2019: finance minister Karvelas:  Is there a threshold \u2013 where rates and inflation hit a certain point \u2013 that the government will provide some immediate relief for people?  Gallagher:  The government will always be looking at what\u2019s the right thing to do by households. Absolutely. It\u2019s on our agenda every time the government meets. You saw that in the budget where we made the deliberate decision where we could to invest in a cost of living budget. In the budget there was a substantial increase into payments for people on pensions, job seeker, aged pension, family assistance ... it\u2019s built in the budget that way so that when costs go up, the indexation realises that.   Updated at 8.58pm GMT    8.43pm    Returning inflation closer to normal \u2018biggest assistance we can provide\u2019: finance minister The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, is speaking with ABC Radio following that decision by the Reserve Bank yesterday to raise interest rates for a seventh consecutive time in as many months. The Reserve Bank is now forecasting inflation to reach 8% by the end of the year, which has been exacerbated by floods and the energy crisis on Ukraine. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks Gallagher how much worse can this economic situation get for households, to which Gallagher replies the government understands \u201cit\u2019s a really challenging set of circumstances\u201d households are facing and that:  Getting inflation back to more normal ranges is the absolute priority, because in the longer term that is going to be the biggest assistance we can provide to households.   Updated at 8.50pm GMT    8.33pm   First sitting of NSW gay hate murder probe  Cold case murders of gay men and LGBTQ+ community members will be investigated in a landmark NSW inquiry. The special commission of inquiry into hate crimes, led by Justice John Sackar, was established in April after it was recommended by a 2019 parliamentary inquiry. Sydney\u2019s wave of anti-gay hate crime peaked during the Aids epidemic of the 1980s, with an estimated 88 gay men killed between 1976 and 2000. Acon, Australia\u2019s largest sexuality community health organisation, said the brutal killings included everything from stabbings and strangulation to bludgeoning and shootings. For the last five months a team of independent barristers, solicitors and investigators has been combing through more than 100,000 documents drawn from 40 years of police and coronial files as well as other sources on LGBTQ+ hate-related deaths. In 2018, NSW police acknowledged \u201cwithout qualification both its and society\u2019s acceptance of gay bashings and shocking violence directed towards gay men, and the LGBTIQ community\u201d with release of the landmark Strike Force Parrabell report. Senior counsel assisting Peter Gray will outline the scope of the inquiry in its first sitting on Wednesday. The special commission, which has investigative powers, is due to deliver its report to the NSW governor in June 2023. - from AAP  Updated at 8.35pm GMT    8.33pm    Severe weather warning for damaging winds for southern Queensland Queensland Fire and Emergency have released this (very adorable) warning for damaging winds for parts of the Maranoa and Warrego, Southeast Coast and Darling Downs and Granite Belt forecast districts.   Updated at 8.34pm GMT    8.23pm   Failure to tackle climate change will put more pressure on health system, peak medical bodies say  Pressures on hospitals and other health services are being exacerbated by a failure to tackle climate change, a coalition of peak medical bodies have warned.The warning comes with the release of the latest MJA-Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, an annual assessment of Australia\u2019s progress in tackling climate change and its health impacts.This year\u2019s review confirmed health harms from life-threatening heat, severe drought, fires, and other disasters are contributing to deteriorating health system capacity.The Royal Australasian College of Physicians president, Dr Jacqueline Small, said the flood devastation across Australia \u201cforewarns increased frequency and intensity of all extreme weather events as a consequence of climate change\u201d. She said:  This is both an immediate and long-term reality. We urge the federal government to move with urgency and ambition on plans for a national climate change, health and wellbeing strategy.  The Australian Medical Association president, Prof Steve Robson, said politicians must \u201cread this report and to act urgently on its recommendations\u201d. The federal budget included funding to establish a National Health Sustainability and Climate Unit and a National Health and Climate Strategy, which Robson welcomed.  Updated at 8.26pm GMT    8.15pm    Natasha May now on deck with you! We\u2019ll be hearing from the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, on ABC radio soon who will be unveiling a new measure out of her report a year after it was delivered. Jenkins and her team investigated the culture in Parliament House, and other commonwealth parliamentary workplaces, handing down a landmark report that found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed. The report made a number of recommendations, such as the establishment of a new Office of Parliamentarian Staffing and Culture to provide centralised human resources support, including policy development, training, advice, support and education. Stay tuned for the new announcement.   Updated at 8.23pm GMT    8.04pm   'Gamble responsibly' to be replaced with 'chances are, you're about to lose' warning  Online gambling companies will be forced to tell their customers \u201cchances are you\u2019re about to lose\u201d under a new set of rules in the National Consumer Protection Framework, writes my colleague Josh Butler. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, will announce the changes today, with the federal government mandating what it says is the first set of nationally consistent messages around the potential harms of online gambling.  Currently, online gambling companies tell users to \u201cgamble responsibly\u201d in their advertisements. From early next year, online wagering companies will be required to run a set of new messages in ads they share via TV, radio, apps, digital or print advertising, social media, and websites, with new taglines including:  Chances are you\u2019re about to lose. Think. Is this a bet you really want to place? What\u2019s gambling really costing you? What are you prepared to lose today? Set a deposit limit. Imagine what you could be buying instead. You win some. You lose more. What are you really gambling with?  The ads, in most cases, must be accompanied by the advisory \u201cFor free and confidential support call 1800 858 858 or visit gamblinghelponline.org.au\u201d. An updated version of the consumer protection framework also requires gambling companies to ensure a full rotation of the taglines over a 12-month period to mitigate \u201cmessage fatigue\u201d for users. \u201cOnline wagering is fast becoming an increasing source of gambling and an increasing source of loss for people,\u201d Rishworth said. \u201cWe have consulted widely and, importantly, we have used evidence to inform these taglines.\u201d The new taglines have come after expensive behavioural research. The government recently opened a parliamentary inquiry into online gambling and gambling harm, which will examine existing consumer protections, counselling and support services, education programs, regulation and licensing schemes, and whether laws should be extended to \u201cgambling-like activities\u201d in video games like loot boxes or social casino games. The government said Australia has the highest gambling losses of any country, at $1,276 per year, with problem gambling rates more than doubling from 0.6% of the adult population in 2011 to 1.23% in 2019. The rates of problem gambling in online users is even higher, at 3.9%. The government said the size of the \u201cinteractive wagering market\u201d is estimated at $6.3bn, compared to electronic gaming at $9bn.  Updated at 8.22pm GMT    8.04pm   Good morning  Welcome to our live news blog. Natasha May will be with you shortly, but first: a look at the main lines this morning. Cost of living concerns look likely to dominate much of the political agenda again today after the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, warned that he would keep raising interest rates while inflation continued to rise. It was a rather bleak follow-up to the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee decision to raise the cash rate by another 0.25% on Tuesday, taking it to 2.85% and increasing pressure on mortgage holders. We\u2019ve got a full story on Lowe\u2019s comments, plus analysis by our economics editor Peter Hannam on how, despite the focus on higher energy bills, the real driver of inflation is mortgage, food and transport. In fact, he writes, average mortgage costs are rising 13 times more quickly than energy bills thanks to the RBA\u2019s series of rate hikes. But there\u2019s also research today that hundreds of thousands of Australians eligible for concessions on their energy bills may not be receiving them, with more than 35% of potential recipients missing out on critical cost-of-living relief in some states. Stick with us for all the day\u2019s news.  Updated at 8.18pm GMT "

                    "body": "  10.36pm   Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Norwich City  FA Cup: Liverpool\u2019s pursuit of what J\u00fcrgen Klopp insists is an unlikely quadruple goes on, though progress into the FA Cup quarter-finals was more complicated than it should have been. Andy Hunter reports ...       10.33pm    Jurgen Klopp: \u201cWith 10 changes you need a little time to adapt but after 15 minutes or so we calmed the game down, scored really good goals, we controlled the game when we played easy passes and looked really good,\u201d the Liverpool manager tells ITV Sport.  \u201cIn the second half we couldn\u2019t score the third goal and they have their situation and that can change the game completely. It didn\u2019t. We had to fight to get it over the line but that\u2019s absolutely fine.\u201d Klopp on Minamino\u2019s two goals: \u201cHe\u2019s an incredible player,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the best game he\u2019s had for us. He played a super game, was a constant threat, kept all the balls. I\u2019m really happy for him. Without him we wouldn\u2019t be in the quarter-finals. Without him we wouldn\u2019t have been in the final of the Carabao Cup.\u201d      10.17pm   Match report: Southampton 3-1 West Ham  FA Cup: West Ham will have to make do with competing on just the two fronts for the remainder of this season after Southampton advanced to the FA Cup quarter-finals at their expense, writes Ben Fisher from St Mary\u2019s.       10.15pm   Match report: Luton Town 2-3 Chelsea  FA Cup: On a day in which their Russian owner announced he is selling the club, Chelsea were forced to come from behind twice before emerging victorious against dogged Luton.       10.12pm    A quick recap: Both managers made plenty of changes and it was Liverpool fringe players Curtis Jones and Takumi Minamino who stood out. Jones was outstanding in the first half before succumbing to a thigh injury, while Minamino scored both Liverpool\u2019s goals to set them on course for victory. They were cruising in the second half, until Lukas Rupp took advantage of some poor defending to pull one back for Norwich. It wasn\u2019t enough, even if young substitute Jon Rowe put the fear of good in Alisson with a late effort.    Updated at 10.23pm GMT    10.08pm   Full time: Liverpool 2-1 Norwich City  Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at Anfield, where Liverpool have advanced to the quarter-finals at the expense of a Norwich City side that put their hosts through the wringer in the closing minutes.      10.05pm    90+3 min: Great work from Tsimikas, who gallops forward down the left and feeds Luis Diaz. He cuts inside and has a shot deflected into the hands of Krul.      10.05pm    90+2 min: What should have been a stroll in the park for Liverpool has become very nervy. They\u2019ve made life needlessly difficult for themselves in these closing stages.      10.03pm    90 min: Norwich lump it long and Jonathan Rowe chases the ball. Alisson gathers. We\u2019ll have four minutes of added time.      10.01pm    87 min: Luis Diaz turns on the edge of the Norwich penalty area, sending two defenders skidding towards the car-park. With all the time in the world to shoot, he curls a shot narrowly wide of the right upright.      9.58pm    85 min: Oof! Jonathan Rowe beats James Milner for speed down the inside left and unleashes a shot. It\u2019s heading for the top corner and needs a crucial touch from Alisson to keep it out.    Updated at 10.05pm GMT    9.57pm    84 min: Liverpool double-substitution: Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz replace Divock Origi and Diogo Jota.      9.56pm    83 min: Norwich win a free-kick halfway inside the Liverpool half. Billy Gilmour puts too much welly on it and sends the ball floating past Liverpool\u2019s high defensive line - three or four yards outside the penalty area - towards Alisson     9.54pm    81 min: Liverpool win a corner which is delayed as Giannoulis receives treatment for cramp from his team-mate Christoph Zimmermann.      9.53pm    79 min: Minamino tees up Jota on the edge of the Norwich penalty area but the Portuguese loses his footing before he can pull the trigger. Liverpool have gone up a couple of gears having dropped their intensity and let Norwich back into the game.      9.51pm    78 min: Norwich City substitution: goalscorer Rupp is replaced by Kenny McLean.      9.50pm   GOAL! Liverpool 2-1 Norwich City (Rupp 77)  Well, that\u2019s told me. Lukas Rupp scores a cracking goal with a shot from distance, taking a pass from Josh Sargent, then taking aim as Joe Gomez backpedalled and invited him on.    Updated at 10.00pm GMT    9.49pm    75 min: Norwich keep plugging away to little or no effect as the game enters its final 15 minutes. They are a very poor side.      9.47pm    72 min: Ibrahima Konate performs heroics to shepherd a very slow rolling ball out of play for a goal kick with Jonathan Rowe snapping at his heels like a little terrier.      9.43pm    70 min: Diogo Jota rises at the far post to meet an inch-perfect cross from Harvey Elliott. Despite his expertise in the air, he sends the ball high and wide of the goal frame when scoring looked easier.    Updated at 9.49pm GMT    9.41pm    66 min: Over in any meaningful way as a contest since Liverpool scored their second goal, this match plods on despite Norwich all but hoisting the white flag of surrender on the hour mark with that triple-substitution. Unless Liverpool\u2019s players succumb to boredom and fall asleep, it\u2019s difficult to see any way back for the Canaries in this game.      9.36pm    63 min: Josh Sargent flings himself at the ball, trying to nod a Giannoulis cross from the left touchline goalwards. He makes contact but sends his effort high and wide. That\u2019s a bad miss \u2013 the American was unmarked and had a clear sight of goal.      9.35pm    60 min: Liverpool substitution: Tyler Morton on for Jordan Henderson. Norwich triple-substitution: Kieran Dowell, Billy Gilmour and Jonathan Rowe on for Teemu Pukki, Mathias Normann and Milot Rashica.      9.31pm    58 min: Southampton have booked their place in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup courtesy of a 3-1 win over West Ham.      9.30pm    58 min: Minamino stands the ball up at the far post but it\u2019s too high for Diogo Jota and bounces wide.      9.29pm    55 min: Gibson\u2019s left arm was hanging down by his side and it\u2019s fair to say he didn\u2019t move it towards the ball before it hit him on the biceps. For all that, it would not have been hugely surprising to see a spot-kick awarded.      9.27pm    53 min: Diogo Jota cuts inside the Norwich penalty area from the left, beats his man and unleashes a shot. It\u2019s on target and hits the arm of Ben Gibson but Liverpool don\u2019t get a penalty.      9.24pm    51 min: A sublime touch from Jota tees up Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who thumps the foot of the post with his low drive from distance.      9.23pm    50 min: Jordan Henderson is booked for a trip on Mathias Normann as the Norwegian tried to gallop upfield.      9.22pm    48 min: James Milner plays a low ball along the floor from deep, trying to play it into the path of Origi. Ben Gibson cuts it out.      9.20pm   Second half: Liverpool 2-0 Norwich City  46 min: Przemyslaw Placheta has come off second best with his collision with the advertising hoarding and is replaced by Josh Sargent. Here\u2019s hoping Placheta is OK, because he really crashed into that board. Harvey Elliott is on for Liverpool, replacing Curtis Jones, who seemed to be nursing a thigh injury as he went off at half-time.      9.15pm    Elsewhere in the FA Cup: Perhaps understandably distracted by other news pertaining to their club\u2019s Russian owner, Chelsea\u2019s players made heavy weather of beating Luton 3-2 to advance to the quarter-finals. Southampton currnelt lead West Ham at St Mary\u2019s, where they\u2019re in the closing minutes.      9.06pm   Half-time: Liverpool 2-0 Norwich City  Peep: Kostas Tsimikas, a photographer and two Norwich medics help Placheta back to his feet as the rest of the players go in for their half-toime brew. He looks a bit winded.  Liverpool lead courtesy of a brace from Takumi Minamino and the FA Cup jig looks well and truly up for Norwich.      9.04pm    45+2 min: Norwich winger Placheta comes out second best in a foot-race with Tsimikas and crashes into and over an advertising hoarding. It sounded painful and Tsimikas goes back to help extricate him. All we can see are a pair of feet sticking over the top.    Updated at 9.24pm GMT    9.02pm    45+2 min: The game has been fairly flat since Liverpool\u2019s opener and is now being played in near silence. Milot Rashica tries to rouse them from their slumber with a low drive from distance that fizzes well wide.      9.00pm    42 min: Much like they did against Southampton on Friday night, Norwich City look completely bereft of ideas against vastly superior opposition. Whatever about them going out of the FA Cup, an exit Dean SMith is unlikely to lose little or any sleep over, it\u2019s difficult to see them avoiding relegation. They\u2019ve three big games against Brentford, Leeds and Chelsea coming up.   Updated at 9.00pm GMT    8.55pm   GOAL! Liverpool 2-0 Norwich City (Minamino 39)  Minamino scores again!  Liverpool win another corner. The ball is headed Minamino\u2019s way at the far post and sits up nicely for him. He puts his laces through it and sends it rocketing past Krul from quite a tight angle.     Updated at 9.57pm GMT    8.53pm    37 min: Kostas Tsimikas pings a cross from the left into the Norwich penalty area, trying to find the head of Origi. Ben Gibson heads clear.      8.49pm    34 min: Diogo Jota is booked, taking one for the team with a trip on Rashica in the centre-circle as he set off on a counter-attack for Norwich City.      8.48pm    33 min: Another corner for Liverpool and this time the ball finds its way back to Alisson standing halfway inside his own half.      8.47pm    32 min: Liverpool win a corner, which Dimitris Giannoulous hacks clear.      8.45pm    29 min: Liverpool had an overload down the inside left and the ball was played into the penalty area by Jones. Jota dummied and Origi showed quick feet in a crowded patch of grass to pick out Minamino to his right. The Japanese winger had plenty of goal to aim at and only Tim Krul to beat - he made no mistake.      8.43pm   GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Norwich City (Minamino 27)  Takumi Minamino fires Liverpool in front, spanking the ball home from six yards out after being teed up by Divock Origi.      8.39pm    24 min: Norwich free-kick halfway inside the Liverpool half. The hosts defend with a ridiculously high line. Risk and reward, etc. Nothing comes of the set piece.      8.38pm    22 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Norwich winger Milot Rashica receives treatment for an injury. He\u2019s passed fit to continue and the game resumes.      8.35pm    20 min: And another corner. Ibrahima Konate gets his head to the inswinging ball but can\u2019t keep it down. Norwich clear again.      8.34pm    19 min: Another corner for Liverpool, which Kostas Tsmiikas takes. Norwich clear courtesy of Pierre Lees-Melou.      8.32pm    17 min: Norwich full-back Sam Byram is booked for a foul on Diogo Jota.      8.31pm    15 min: Teemu Pukki shoots low, hard, and wide of the far upright, nutmegging Curtis Jones as he did so. That was a chance for Norwich, whose Finnish striker missed an almost identical chance against Southampton on Friday night.      8.30pm    12 min: Milner plays a ball from deep trying to pick out Diogo Jota in the Liverpool penalty area. Christoph Zimmermann does well to put it out for a corner. From that, Liverpool win another after good defensive work from Ben Gibson, who prevents Jota from pulling the ball back into the penalty area from the byline.      8.26pm    11 min: Joe Gomez dispossesses Placheta with a strong tackle, putting the ball out for a Norwich throw-in deep in Liverpool territory.      8.25pm    9 min: Oof! Curtis Jones cuts inside and unleashes a shot. It\u2019s close but no cigar from the Liverpool midfielder, who sees the ball scrape paint off the top of the crossbar.      8.23pm    6 min: Liverpool attack with intent for the first time and win themselves a corner, their first of the game. Norwich City clear the ball and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain tries a shot from distance. His low effort skids wide of the left post.      8.20pm    5 min: James Milner hoists a cross from the right touchline into the Norwich City penalty area but it sails straight into the arms of Tim Krul.      8.19pm    4 min: A positive start for Norwich. Lukas Rupp plays a ball down the right flank for Teemu Pukki to chase but the Finn\u2019s lack of pace lets him down. Joe Gomez comfortably beats him to the ball and plays a pass to Alisson.      8.18pm    2 min: Mathias Normann tries to play Przemysiaw Placheta in behind Liverpool\u2019s defence with a ball over the top but Alisson is quick off his line and out of his area to clear. Offside.      8.16pm   Liverpool v Norwich City is go ...  1 min: The ball is rolling at Anfield, where both sets of players are wearing their home colours.      8.12pm    Not long now: The teams make their way out on to the Anfield pitch and line up either side of Martin Atkinson and his team of match officials. Kick-off is just a few minutes away.      8.05pm    Elsewhere in the FA Cup: Chelsea are making big headlines off the pitch and on it they are in trouble against Luton Town in the FA Cup fifth round. Harry Cornick has just fired the hosts 2-1 ahead at Kenilworth Road as they approach half-time. Scott Murray has the latest ...       7.32pm    Those teams: Jurgen Klopp makes 10 changes to the team that started the Carabao Cup final, with skipper Jordan Henderson the only Wembley starter not to be given the night off. Norwich make seven changes to the team that surrendered fairly feebly against Southampton on Friday night. Tim Krul is back in goal after recovering from a shoulder injury, while Ben Gibson takes the captain\u2019s armband in the absence of Grant Hanley. Pierre Lees-Melou, Lukas Rupp, Przemyslaw Placheta, Dimitrios Giannoulis, Sam Byram and Christoph Zimmermann all come in.      7.22pm    Liverpool: Alisson, Milner, Konate, Gomez, Tsimikas, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Jones, Minamino, Origi, Jota. Subs: Mane, Adrian, Diaz, Robertson, Matip, Kelleher, Morton, Bradley, Elliott. Norwich: Krul, Byram, Zimmermann, Gibson, Giannoulis, Rupp, Normann, Lees-Melou, Placheta, Pukki, Rashica. Subs: Gilmour, Dowell, Tzolis, Sorensen, McLean, Sargent, Gunn, Tomkinson, Rowe.  Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)     7.20pm         7.20pm         7.08pm    Tonight\u2019s match officials   Referee: Martin Atkinson  Referee\u2019s assistants: Stuart Burt and Nick Hopton Fourth official: Mike Dean  VAR: John Brooks        7.05pm         7.04pm    Early team news Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino remains sidelined with a groin injury, while Thiago Alcantara, who was reduced to tears after injuring himself in the Carabao Cup final warm-up, remains out with a thigh injury. Following his heroics in Sunday\u2019s final, Caoimhin Kelleher is likely to keep his place in goal.  Norwich skipper Grant Hanley is ruled out through suspension, which means German defender Christoph Zimmerman is likely to come into the side. Full-backs Max Aarons and Brandon Williams were due to be assessed ahead of tonight\u2019s game, but Andrew Omobamidele, Adam Idah and Ozan Kabak are all out.      7.04pm         7.04pm   FA Cup fifth round: Liverpool v Norwich City  There\u2019s a place in the last eight of the FA Cup up for grabs at Anfield tonight, where recently coronated League Cup champions Liverpool host the Premier League\u2019s bottom side Norwich City.  In three meetings between the sides already this season, Liverpool have won by an aggregate score of 9-1 and few give Norwich, who have not made the quarter-finals since 1992, a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of causing an upset tonight. Kick-off on Merseyside is at the unusual time of 8.15pm (GMT) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.   "

                    "body": "On Sunday 1 February 1970, senior politicians and gas executives from Germany and the Soviet Union gathered at the upmarket Hotel Kaiserhof in Essen. They were there to celebrate the signing of a contract for the first major Russia-Germany gas pipeline, which was to run from Siberia to the West German border at Marktredwitz in Bavaria. The contract was the result of nine months of intense bargaining over the price of the gas, the cost of 1.2m tonnes of German pipes to be sold to Russia, and the credit terms offered to Moscow by a consortium of 17 German banks. Aware of the risk of Russia defaulting, the German banks\u2019 chief financial negotiator, Friedrich Wilhelm Christians, took the precaution of asking for a loan from the federal government, explaining: \u201cI don\u2019t do any somersaults without a net, especially not on a trapeze.\u201d The relationship would benefit both sides: Germany would supply the machines and high-quality industrial goods; Russia would provide the raw material to fuel German industry. High-pressure pipelines and their supporting infrastructure hold the potential to bind countries together, since they require trust, cooperation and mutual dependence. But this was not just a commercial deal, as the presence at the hotel of the German economic minister Karl Schiller showed. For the advocates of Ostpolitik \u2013 the new \u201ceastern policy\u201d of rapprochement towards the Soviet Union and its allies including East Germany, launched the previous year under chancellor Willy Brandt \u2013 this was a moment of supreme political consequence. Schiller, an economist by training, was to describe it as part of an effort at \u201cpolitical and human normalisation with our Eastern neighbours\u201d. The sentiment was laudable, but for some observers it was a potentially dangerous move. Before the signing, Nato had discreetly written to the German economics ministry to inquire about the security implications. Norbert Plesser, head of the gas department at the ministry, had assured Nato that there was no cause for alarm: Germany would never rely on Russia for even 10% of its gas supplies. Half a century later, in 2020, Russia would supply more than half of Germany\u2019s natural gas and about a third of all the oil that Germans burned to heat homes, power factories and fuel vehicles. Roughly half of Germany\u2019s coal imports, which are essential to its steel manufacturing, came from Russia. An arrangement that began as a peacetime opening to a former foe has turned into an instrument of aggression. Germany is now funding Russia\u2019s war. In the first two months after the start of Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine, Germany is estimated to have paid nearly \u20ac8.3bn for Russian energy \u2013 money used by Moscow to prop up the rouble and buy the artillery shells firing at Ukrainian positions in Donetsk. In that time, EU countries are estimated to have paid a total of \u20ac39bn for Russian energy, more than double the sum they have given to help Ukraine defend itself. The irony is painful. \u201cFor thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism,\u201d the historian Timothy Snyder wrote recently. \u201cWhen fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it.\u201d  When Putin invaded Ukraine in February, Germany faced a particular problem. Its rejection of nuclear power and its transition away from coal meant that Germany had very few alternatives to Russian gas. Berlin has been forced to accept that it was a cataclysmic error to have made itself so dependent on Russian energy \u2013 whatever the motives behind it. The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, says Germany failed to listen to the warnings from countries that had once suffered under Russia\u2019s occupation, such as Poland and the Baltic states. For Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, a former environment minister and member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrat Union (CDU), the German government bowed to industry forces pressing for cheap gas \u201call too easily\u201d, while \u201ccompletely ignoring the geopolitical risks\u201d. In February this year, German Green economic affairs and climate action minister Robert Habeck said that gas storage facilities owned by Gazprom in Germany had been \u201csystematically emptied\u201d over the winter, to drive up prices and exert political pressure. It was a staggering admission of Russia\u2019s power to disrupt energy supplies. \u201cI was wrong,\u201d the former German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, says, simply. \u201cWe were all wrong.\u201d In recent weeks even Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, a totemic figure of the Social Democrats and greatest German advocate of the trade \u201cbridge\u201d between east and west, has recanted. He admits he misread Russia\u2019s intentions as he pursued the construction of a new undersea gas pipeline. \u201cMy adherence to Nord Stream 2 was clearly a mistake,\u201d he told German media in April. \u201cWe held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and that our partners warned us about.\u201d This is an extraordinary admission for a man who acted as chief of staff to Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the Social Democratic chancellor from 1998 to 2005 and thereafter a lavishly rewarded, and much reviled, lobbyist for Vladimir Putin. Steinmeier was also foreign minister under Chancellor Merkel, and a great evangelist for Wandel durch Handel, the concept that trade and dialogue can bring about social and political change. How did Germany end up making such a blunder? Some argue that Merkel should have seen that Putin was taking Russia in an authoritarian direction when he announced his return to the presidency in 2011. After Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Germany made no move to stop importing Russian gas, and although Merkel threatened to introduce crippling trade sanctions, German industry convinced her to hold back. But some blame a more persistent misjudgment stretching back 50 years, based on a fallacy that authoritarian countries can be transformed through trade.  The Social Democrats have now set up a review into whether the policy of Ostpolitik \u2013 first laid out in a landmark speech in July 1963 by Egon Bahr, then the closest adviser to West Berlin\u2019s mayor and chancellor-to-be, Willy Brandt \u2013 became deformed over time, especially after securing its great achievement, the fall of the Berlin Wall. What is extraordinary, retracing the history through memoirs and contemporary records, is how frequently and determinedly Germany was warned, by everyone from Henry Kissinger onwards, that it was making a pact it might live to regret. Kissinger wrote to Richard Nixon on 9 April 1970: \u201cFew people, either inside Germany or abroad, see Brandt as selling out to the East; what worries people is whether he can control what he has started.\u201d Over 50 years, Germany fought numerous battles with a series of US presidents over its growing dependence on Russian energy. In the process, Germany\u2019s foreign office developed a view of American anti-communism as naive, and a belief that only Germany truly understood the Soviet Union. From the late 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany tried to open its own direct line of communication with the Soviet leadership, even though its interest in reunification created tensions with the US. When it faced criticism from the US, Germany was wont to cite its unique status. \u201cI cannot imagine there is anyone more interested in being allowed to continue working for detente and balance in Europe than the German people who are forced to live in two states,\u201d Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then the foreign minister, told the German Bundestag in January 1980, to great applause. But after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, why was Germany still so reluctant to listen to others? A sense of guilt for the atrocities committed against the Soviet Union during the second world war may have played a role. Pride, too, that \u2013 through Ostpolitik \u2013 it had mended its relations with Moscow. Germany, in a sense, became a double prisoner of its past \u2013 bound both to the horrors it had committed, and to its belief that its response to those horrors was correct. * * * The conflicts between Germany and the US in the 70s and 80s, involving two very different presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, were some of the most rancorous transatlantic battles since the second world war. \u201cThe disputes were all part of West Germany showing independence in foreign policy during the cold war, and that became uncomfortable for some American leaders,\u201d the historian Mary Elise Sarotte said to me. Carter and the German chancellor Helmut Schmidt had little respect for each other. Carter found Schmidt moody, while the chancellor, in his autobiography, dismissed Carter as an idealistic preacher, who knew nothing of Europe and was \u201cjust not big enough for the game\u201d. The two leaders did not just grate personally, they disagreed on issues of substance \u2013 including how to protect human rights in Russia. In 1979 Schmidt and Carter came together to jointly adopt the so-called dual track decision, by which Nato would upgrade its nuclear weapons based in Europe, while actively seeking an arms control agreement with Russia. But in other ways their approach was very different. Schmidt never lacked self-confidence, but like many Germans of that era he carried a deep sense of shame arising from painful war memories. He also believed that the stability of the eastern bloc was in the interest of West Germany, given Russia\u2019s nuclear capability. In his autobiography he wrote that he had wanted to develop trading relations with Russia, in order to foster \u201ca greater Soviet dependence upon European supplies\u201d, in turn leading to \u201cmore European influence\u201d on Moscow\u2019s policies. And following the 1973 oil crisis, Schmidt became convinced that the Soviet Union represented a more reliable supplier of energy for Germany than the Gulf states. Carter, by contrast, saw withholding trade as the better way to influence the Soviets. In July 1978, responding to Moscow\u2019s imprisonment of two Soviet dissidents, Aleksandr Ginzburg and Anatoly Shcharansky, Carter restricted US exports of technology for the exploration and development of the Soviet oil and natural-gas industries.  Yet, collectively, European business went in the opposite direction. Even after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, a large German business delegation went ahead with a visit to Moscow. The Soviets (Soyuzgazexport) and western Europeans (chiefly Ruhrgas and Gaz de France) completed negotiations on a new giant gas project, a 4,500km dedicated pipeline from the giant Urengoy field in West Siberia in late 1980. This deal was projected to increase Germany\u2019s dependence on Russian gas from 15% to 30%. When German ministers reviewed the security implications, they concluded there was no danger of Russia misusing its potential stranglehold. Their reasoning was simple. \u201cLong-term disruption would be against the self-interest of the Soviet Union,\u201d the ministry decided. In a phone call with Carter on 5 March, Schmidt explained his support for the pipeline by telling the US president, \u201cThose engaging in trade with each other do not shoot at one another.\u201d It was a restatement of Norman Angell\u2019s famous pre-first world war theory that the new interdependence of economies made war unprofitable and thus irrational. According to a note in his diary, Carter responded: \u201cIt is not beneficial for the Europeans to expect us to provide the stick and for them to compete with one another about providing the biggest carrot.\u201d In 1980, Schmidt wrote: \u201cTo speak of the Federal Republic\u2019s economic dependence on Moscow to a degree large enough to affect foreign policy indicates ignorance or malice.\u201d Given Germany\u2019s plight now, those words look hopelessly misjudged. * * * Schmidt faced a more challenging opponent in Carter\u2019s successor, the traditional anti-communist Ronald Reagan. In Reagan\u2019s eyes, German trade with Russia was in direct conflict with western security. Reagan\u2019s view was informed by a CIA assessment submitted in July 1981, which noted a clear trend: from 1970 to 1980, Soviet gas exports to western Europe had risen from 1 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year to 26.5bcm annually. The CIA warned Reagan that the Urengoy gas project would not only accelerate Soviet economic growth, but provide the Soviets with $8bn in hard currency, facilitating a further military buildup. Far from giving Germany sway over Soviet thinking, \u201cit would provide the Soviets one additional pressure point they could use as part of a broader diplomatic offensive to persuade the West Europeans to accept their viewpoint on East-West issues\u201d.  In arguments that echo today\u2019s debates, the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, complained: \u201cWe consistently find in our talks the allies are already significantly dependent: France for 15% [of its] gas, Germany for 30%.\u201d Schmidt assured the Americans that Germany \u201ccan go six months in the event of a Soviet cut-off\u201d. The forecast now is that, in such an eventuality, Germany would have to go straight to a form of energy rationing. Despite various US efforts to persuade Europe to adopt a voluntary ban, including offering alternative sources of energy, in 1981 Ruhrgas AG and Soyusgazexport went ahead and signed a contract for annual imports of 10.5bcm of Soviet gas over a 25-year period. Unemployment in Europe was close to 9% at the time, and European industry needed to boost its energy supplies. At the same time, the US argument about security was dismissed as a veiled way of promoting the US oil industry. When Moscow backed the imposition of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981, Reagan thought such a shocking event might persuade Germany to put the pipeline on hold. In a private note to Margaret Thatcher, sent on 19 December 1981, he urged her to back tough sanctions against the Soviets, stating that \u201cthis may well be a watershed in the history of mankind. A challenge to tyranny from within.\u201d Unusually for her, Thatcher vacillated, advising Reagan that the Germans \u201ccannot and will not give up the gas pipeline project\u201d.  The US responded to the Soviet intervention by banning US companies from helping with the pipeline. In the summer of 1982 Reagan tried to force European firms to stop working on the pipeline by imposing secondary sanctions on them. Such sanctions are now a commonplace in the US foreign policy armoury, particularly over Iran, but then, they were seen as an incursion into European sovereignty. Thatcher bridled, telling the Commons \u201cit is wrong\u201d for \u201cone very powerful nation [to] prevent existing contracts being fulfilled\u201d. By November, Reagan had abandoned the attempt to impose sanctions. In a trial of strength in which Europe sided with Germany, the world\u2019s superpower had lost. The new pipeline started pumping on 1 January 1984. The German advocates of change through trade had won. The US position on Russia was further weakened when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The peaceful collapse of communism was trumpeted as a vindication for those that had championed dialogue, and engagement through trade. In a speech to the Brandt Foundation in March 2008, Steinmeier gave full vent to this view: \u201cWhat Ostpolitik in fact achieved \u2013 as is now recognised also by those who criticised it at the time,\u201d he said, \u201cwas to make peace in Europe, despite the difficulties, a degree more secure. For the democracy movements in eastern Europe it created new possibilities, new scope for action. It was a key factor, too, in finally ending the confrontation between the two blocs.\u201d Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s current chancellor, remains an adherent of this view, arguing last year that it contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union and laid the basis for democracy and EU membership for much of eastern Europe. The SPD co-leader, Lars Klingbeil, has also insisted that Ostpolitik \u201cwas the basis for reunification and the end of the cold war. As a result, there has been a consensus in the federal republic for decades that conflicts can be defused through dialogue. We won\u2019t let that be bad-mouthed.\u201d Yet a number of historians and writers believe that this rosy picture of Ostpolitik is misleading. \u201cThe idea that Willy Brandt\u2019s policy of detente towards Moscow led in a straight line to the fall of the iron curtain and German unity is at least an over-simplification,\u201d says the historian Jan Behrends. German journalist Thomas Urban, author of a new book critiquing Ostpolitik, believes its role in the fall of the wall and German reunification has been exaggerated: \u201cIt was military buildup by Reagan and the flooding of the market with cheap oil that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union,\u201d he told me. The Russian government budget had grown so dependent on energy for its revenue, he said, that when the price of oil plummeted in the mid-1980s, Russia\u2019s lifeline to external capital dried up. \u201cGorbachev could no longer fund the overseas wars and the Soviet Republics,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this argument was entirely missing in the German debate, especially on the left.\u201d Urban argued that Ostpolitik\u2019s theory of change suffered from two basic misconceptions: the belief that political change in eastern Europe could only come from engaging with the elite in power, rather than from civilian movements, and second, that \u201csecurity must be the key to everything\u201d. * * * By the turn of the century, the advocates of change through trade were in their pomp. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der, with growing confidence, promoted the idea of a strategic partnership with Russia. He invited the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to address the Bundestag in 2001, where he won over his audience by giving the speech in fluent German and declaring \u201cthe cold war is over\u201d. Schr\u00f6der, at the time of Putin\u2019s address, saw a perfect confluence of interests between Europe, Germany and Russia: peace, stability, multilateralism and economic growth. Putin, Schr\u00f6der was convinced, \u201cwants to transform Russia into a democracy\u201d. In this favourable political climate, pro-Russian German lobbyists such as Klaus Mangold, chairman of the powerful German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, pursued the construction of yet another gas pipeline, this time taking gas from Vyborg under the Baltic Sea to Germany \u2013 the first Nord Stream. The scheme was especially controversial since it would bypass Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, reducing those countries\u2019 incomes, weakening their bargaining power and depriving them of badly needed transit fees. The \u20ac7.4bn pipeline construction costs were to be borne by the private German companies BASF and E.ON, and the majority Russian state-owned Gazprom. This time, protests against the pipeline did not just come from the US, but from the states that had recently emerged from Soviet rule, such as Poland and Lithuania. Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, then Poland\u2019s defence minister, notoriously compared the plan to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which paved the way for the invasion of Poland. Yet on 8 September 2005, 10 days before the election in which Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Social Democrats lost to Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives, the Nord Stream 1 contract was signed in Berlin by representatives of Gazprom, E.ON and BASF. Putin stood alongside Schr\u00f6der at the signing ceremony. Schr\u00f6der has since been singled out for his role in creating Germany\u2019s dependence on Russian energy, and getting very rich in the process. But the distinguished former German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger recently argued that Schr\u00f6der should not take the blame for giving the go-ahead to Nord Stream 20 years ago: most German politicians, he told the New York Times in April, did not question whether they were getting into an unhealthy dependence on Russian energy. In the article, Schr\u00f6der made the same case: \u201cIt never occurred to anyone that this could become a problem. It was just a way of procuring gas for Germans, for Germany\u2019s heavy industry, and also for the chemical industry, with fewer problems and disruptions.\u201d Thereafter it seemed, whatever the setbacks in German-Russian relations, nothing could shift the faith in trade \u2013 not Russia\u2019s \u201cpeace enforcement operation\u201d in Georgia in August 2008, not the Russian disruption of the gas pipelines in a dispute with Ukraine in January 2009, nor the news that Putin was planning to return to the presidency in 2012, replacing Dmitry Medvedev, in whom Frank-Walter Steinmeier had placed his faith. In 2011, the year Nord Stream finally opened, German total trade exports to Russia rose 34% to \u20ac27bn.  Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2014. Initially, Russia\u2019s incursion seemed to mark a turning point. Merkel\u2019s condemnation was clear: the annexation of Crimea was contrary to international law. Sanctions were duly imposed, and German exports to Russia fell. Following the 2014 invasion, serious German media such as Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published lengthy articles looking at the options for how Germany could wean itself off its dangerous dependency on Russian energy. Many of the proposals, such as new liquid gas terminals to allow Germany to import gas from other countries such as Qatar and the US, are the same ones under discussion now, which shows how little actual diversification was achieved. When I spoke to a Qatari energy official last month, he recounted how they spent five years trying to break into the German energy market, only to find their route blocked at every turn. Some German sanctions on Russia continued for many years, but the advocates of change through trade gradually re-established their ground. It seemed nothing Russia could do would shake their confidence. On 4 September 2015, at the Vladivostok economic forum, with Putin in attendance, an agreement was signed for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on the Baltic seabed, which would vastly increase Germany\u2019s reliance on Russian natural gas. Gazprom would also take over Germany\u2019s gas storage business, thereby handing control of German energy reserves to a foreign power. * * * Various theories \u2013 some grubby, some metaphysical \u2013 have been proposed to explain Germany\u2019s dogged refusal to see the dangers in its dependency on Russia. One argument places the blame on SPD politicians and civil servants who were allowed to move seamlessly between public office and Putin\u2019s employment, and worked hard to manipulate the EU and German regulatory environment to suit Gazprom. Then there is the question of the German-Russian industrial lobby, as symbolised by the German-Russian Forum, which was closely linked with, and partly funded by, German companies active in Russia. (The Forum was suspended after the invasion of Ukraine.) Its board of trustees consisted mainly of business people, often with economic interests in Russia. Its chairman, Matthias Platzeck, the former SPD minister president of Brandenburg, seemed genuinely shocked by Putin\u2019s invasion: \u201cI was wrong because until recently I thought what happened was unthinkable.\u201d The historian Sarotte said there is no clear evidence that business had exerted greater influence in politics in Germany than in other countries. Nevertheless, over the years, Russia showed an ability to suborn, and in some cases corrupt, the German political class. The Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, on a visit to Berlin in late May, called German Ostpolitik a \u201cfiasco\u201d. German rhetoric around the political value of interdependence, he said, crudely boiled down to gaining a competitive advantage through cheap energy.  Thomas Urban, examining the psychological roots of Ostpolitik, pinpoints two emotions in Germany\u2019s relationship with Russia: nostalgia and guilt. He described to me \u201cthe memory of Bismarck, who saw the alliance with Russia as an anchor of stability in Europe. But then there was also the feeling of guilt because of the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, with millions of dead. It meant it was difficult to criticise the Red Army or the Soviet repression since to do so means you do not recognise the greatest crimes in history. It makes Germany blind to the black side of the Soviet Union. It also permits Putin\u2019s propaganda by talking only of the Russian war dead, and not those that were killed in Ukraine and Belarus.\u201d Much of Germany\u2019s belief in trade with Russia was born of wishful thinking. It led Steinmeier as foreign minister, for instance, to look constantly for signs of reform, ignoring foreign office advice that he needed a plan B in case Germany\u2019s faith in Russia turned out to be ill-founded. In 2016, Steinmeier gave a deeply sincere, almost elegiac speech at Yekaterinburg University asking whether Germany and Russia were still capable of listening to one another. He admitted the annexation of Crimea had been a low point, but hoped dialogue was still possible, urging both sides not to turn their backs on one another.  It was the speech of a man who sensed the tide was going out, and who feared his belief in dialogue no longer matched the spirit of harsher times: \u201cIn political discussions, we sometimes hear opinions expressed by people who are not interested in the slightest in understanding others; people who have already made up their minds about the other side; people who don\u2019t even bother reading because they think they already know the answer.\u201d What he described as the \u201csupposed antagonism\u201d between the west and Russia, he feared was becoming entrenched and ideologically driven, running counter to the pursuit of diplomacy and peace. Now, as Germany\u2019s president and head of state, Steinmeier has been told by Ukrainian officials that his record as the promoter of Russian interests in Germany means he is not welcome in Kyiv at this time. It seems a shame. There would be no need for him to fall to his knees \u2013 as Willy Brandt did in Warsaw in 1970, apologising for his nation\u2019s wartime crimes \u2013 but he could give a sober reflection on what precisely went wrong with Germany\u2019s eastern policy for so long. For, one way or another, a reckoning is still needed.  \u2022 This article was amended on 2 and 3 June 2022 to make clear that when Egon Bahr was adviser to Willy Brandt in 1963, the latter was yet to become chancellor; and that officials at the 1970 Essen meeting were representing the Soviet Union rather than Russia.  \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

Here\u2019s where we stand:  Russia no longer has full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed last week. The Russian military has acknowledged that Kyiv\u2019s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its \u201csuperior tank units\u201d had managed to \u201cpenetrate the depths of our defence\u201d around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka.    Ukraine has \u201cfully cleared\u201d Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. Lyman\u2019s recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia\u2019s largest battlefield loss since Ukraine\u2019s lightning counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in September. Russias\u2019s ministry of defence spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said Russian troops had occupied what he called a \u201cpre-prepared defensive line\u201d. His comments are an admission that Ukraine\u2019s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Ukrainian brigades appear to have achieved their biggest breakthrough in the region since the war started, bursting through the frontline and advancing rapidly along the Dnieper River. President Zelenskiy said Ukraine is not just experiencing military success in Lyman, but also in Kherson. In his overnight statement, he said Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region. Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Russian-imposed authority in the region, admitted that Ukrainians had gained some ground. Ukraine\u2019s military has said its forces recaptured the village of Torske near Lyman in the Donetsk region on Sunday. Russian forces who have been forced to retreat towards Luhansk\u2019s city of Kreminna are being hit \u201cwith fire\u201d by Ukrainian missile units, artillery and air forces, according to Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern group of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The Kremlin is still determining which areas of occupied Ukraine it has \u201cannexed\u201d, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson has said. Putin has vowed to protect Russia\u2019s newly claimed territories using \u201call means at its disposal\u201d, indicating a potential nuclear strike. The lack of a clear red line may undermine his attempts at using nuclear deterrence to halt Ukraine\u2019s successful counteroffensive and western support for Kyiv. The lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament, the state Duma, has approved laws on annexing four Ukrainian territories into Russia. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against the bill to incorporate the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk regions into Russia. Lawmakers in the upper house, Russia\u2019s federation council, are expected to formalise the illegal annexation on Tuesday. The Kremlin also said Russia favours a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d to the issue of nuclear weapons that is not based on emotion. The remarks by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov come after Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of the Chechnya region, said Moscow should consider using a \u201clow-yield\u201d nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been released, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi. Ihor Murashov was detained on Friday by a Russian patrol as he travelled from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the town of Enerhodar, according to the state-owned company in charge of the plant. Russia has sacked the commander of its western military district, Col Gen Alexander Zhuravlyov, according to news outlet RBC. The reported departure of Zhuravlyov, who led one of the five military districts that make up Russia\u2019s armed forces, is the latest in a series of top officials to be fired after a series of defeats and humiliations in the war in Ukraine. Thousands of people called up to fight in Ukraine from a far-eastern Russian region have been sent home due to wrongful mobilisation, according to a local official. In the Khabarovsk region, about 8,500km (5,300 miles) east of Moscow, the governor, Mikhail Degtyaryov, said an enlistment officer had been suspended for the wrongful mobilisation. The Chechen leader and Vladimir Putin ally, Ramzan Kadyrov, has said that his three underage sons are heading to fight in Ukraine. Kadyrov said \u201cthe time has come\u201d for his sons, 14, 15 and 16 years old, \u201cto show themselves in a real battle\u201d and that they will \u201csoon go to the frontline\u201d. Russia has put Marina Ovsyannikova, the former state TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest against the Ukraine war, on a wanted list after she reportedly escaped house arrest. The Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, 44, gained international attention in March after bursting into a studio of Channel One, her then employer, to denounce the Ukraine war during a live news bulletin, holding a poster reading \u201cno war\u201d. The EU has summoned Russia\u2019s top diplomat in Brussels in protest of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cillegal annexation\u201d of four Ukrainian territories. The move is part of a coordinated exercise with EU member states, Peter Stano, a foreign affairs spokesperson for the bloc, said. Ukraine is offering the US full visibility into its list of intended Russian targets in the hopes of receiving a new set of powerful, long-range rocket systems, according to Ukrainian officials. The move essentially gives the US veto power over Ukrainian targeting of Russia and is intended to convince the Biden administration that Ukraine would not use these new weapons to strike inside Russian territory.   A record 83% of Ukrainians would like their country to join the Nato military alliance, according to a new poll. Only 4% said they would vote against joining Nato and 9% said they would not vote.  That\u2019s it from me, L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for following. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.  Updated at 7.16pm BST    6.41pm    An independent Polish military analyst has raised alarms by identifying a train apparently moving through central Russia laden with trucks, as belonging to the 12th main directorate of the Russian armed forces, which is involved in the storage, transport, maintenance and issuance of nuclear weapons. The claim comes at a time when Vladimir Putin and his top officials have been signalling that Russia will use all forces at its disposal to defend Russian territory, which the Kremlin, but almost no one else, now defines as including much of eastern Ukraine. The analyst, Konrad Muzyka, said in a Twitter thread that the movement of the train does not necessarily mean preparations are being made for nuclear use. He said it could just be more signalling, or it could be training or regular wargaming.   Muzyka does not make clear what it was about the train or the trucks that led him to identify them as coming from 12th main directorate, and has not yet replied to a query about it. Image analysts at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey studied the short film that Muzyka retweeted as his source, and could not find identifying details. \u201cYes, the 12th main directorate has such trucks, but so does every other military unit,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear expert at the institute, said. \u201cI can see nothing that would lead me to think those trucks are 12th directorate as opposed to something else.\u201d  Updated at 6.48pm BST    6.33pm    Ukraine\u2019s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has mocked Elon Musk for suggesting that Kyiv should accept Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in return for an end to the war. Musk proposed his recipe for peace between Russia and Ukraine on Twitter, accompanied by a poll:  Podolyak tweeted in response:   Updated at 6.49pm BST    5.53pm    A record 83% of Ukrainians would like their country to join the Nato military alliance, according to a new poll. The poll, conducted by the Kyiv-based opinion pollster Rating Group, surveyed 2,000 Ukrainians after the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced that Ukraine was submitting an expedited application for Nato membership. The percentage of those supporting Nato membership was the highest ever recorded by a survey in Ukraine, the pollster said. Only 4% said they would vote against joining Nato and 9% said they would not vote. From the Kyiv Independent\u2019s Illia Ponomarenko:   Updated at 6.05pm BST    5.23pm    A Czech crowdfunding campaign has raised more than \u00a31.2m to buy a modernised tank for the Ukrainian army to help it defend against Russia\u2019s invasion. The campaign, dubbed \u201ca gift for Putin\u201d, received donations from 11,288 individual donors and was backed by the Czech defence ministry and Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Prague. The Czech Republic has become the first country where ordinary people bought a tank for Ukrainian troops, said the Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, Yevhen Perebyinis, on Twitter.  The modernised Soviet-era T-72 tank, named Tomas, will be sent to Ukraine.  Updated at 5.24pm BST    5.06pm    Russia has put Marina Ovsyannikova, the former state TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest against the Ukraine war, on a wanted list after she reportedly escaped house arrest. The Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, 44, gained international attention in March after bursting into a studio of Channel One, her then employer, to denounce the Ukraine war during a live news bulletin, holding a poster reading \u201cno war\u201d. At the time she was fined 30,000 roubles (\u00a3460) for shunning protest laws.  Ovsyannikova continued protesting against the war and was charged in August with spreading false information about the Russian army for holding up a poster that read \u201cPutin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists\u201d during a solo protest on the Moskva River embankment opposite the Kremlin. She was subsequently placed under house arrest to await trial and was facing up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. On Saturday, Ovsyannikova\u2019s ex-husband said she had escaped house arrest together with her young daughter. \u201cLast night, my ex-wife left the place that the court assigned her, and disappeared with my 11-year-old daughter in an unknown direction,\u201d Igor Ovsyannikov, who is employed at the state-run news outlet RT, said. Ovsyannikova\u2019s whereabouts are unknown and she did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Monday, she was added to the interior ministry\u2019s online list of fugitives, accompanied by a photograph. Read the full story here:      4.47pm   Head of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been released, says IAEA chief  The head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been released, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi. Ihor Murashov, the director general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has returned to his family safely, Grossi wrote on Twitter.  Murashov was detained on Friday by a Russian patrol as he travelled from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the town of Enerhodar, where many of the plant\u2019s staff live, according to the state-owned company in charge of the plant. The head of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said in a statement:  He was taken out of the car, and with his eyes blindfolded he was driven in an unknown direction,  The IAEA later confirmed it had been in contact with \u201cthe relevant authorities\u201d without mentioning Russia by name and said it had been informed that Murashov was in \u201ctemporary detention\u201d. Murashov\u2019s detention \u201chas an immediate and serious impact on decision-making in ensuring the safety and security of the plant\u201d, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Saturday.  Updated at 5.32pm BST    4.39pm    Three Russian men who were called up to fight in the war in Ukraine have died at an army training centre in Poroshino in Russia\u2019s Yekaterinburg region, according to Novaya Gazeta. The Russian state Duma lawmaker, Maxim Ivanov, was cited by a local news outlet as saying:  Yes, I confirm that three people have died. One of the mobilised men died from a heart attack, another one committed suicide. The third one was discharged and sent home, where he died from cirrhosis of the liver.  Another news outlet earlier reported the suicide of a 46-year-old from the Kurgan region, whose body was reportedly found in the canteen of the Poroshino army training centre.  Updated at 5.00pm BST    4.25pm   Russia no longer has full control of any of four \u2018annexed\u2019 Ukrainian provinces  Russia no longer has full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed last week after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province in the south of the country and made additional gains in the east. On Monday, the Russian military acknowledged that Kyiv\u2019s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its \u201csuperior tank units\u201d had managed to \u201cpenetrate the depths of our defence\u201d around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka.  The ministry of defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russian troops had occupied what he called a \u201cpre-prepared defensive line\u201d.

His comments are an admission that Ukraine\u2019s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Ukrainian brigades appear to have achieved their biggest breakthrough in the region since the war started, bursting through the frontline and advancing rapidly along the Dnieper River. Kyiv gave no official confirmation of the gains. Russian sources acknowledged that the Ukrainian tank offensive had moved along the river\u2019s west bank, recapturing a number of villages along the way, and threatening the supply lines for thousands of marooned Russian troops. Read the full report by my colleagues Luke Harding, Isobel Koshiw and Peter Beaumont:   Updated at 4.34pm BST    4.16pm    Russia has sacked the commander of its western military district, Col Gen Alexander Zhuravlyov, according to news outlet RBC. The reported departure of Zhuravlyov, who led one of the five military districts that make up Russia\u2019s armed forces, is the latest in a series of top officials to be fired after a series of defeats and humiliations in the war in Ukraine. It comes after dramatic Russian losses in north-east Ukraine in September and the recapture by Ukraine on Saturday of the key eastern city of Lyman. Zhuravlyov will be replaced by Lieut Gen Roman Berdnikov, RBC reported. There was no official confirmation of the change.  Updated at 4.23pm BST    4.00pm   Summary of the day so far  It\u2019s 6pm in Kyiv.

Hello everyone, it\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong still here to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email.  Updated at 4.03pm BST    3.45pm    Ukraine is offering the US full visibility into its list of intended Russian targets in the hopes of receiving a new set of powerful, long-range rocket systems, according to Ukrainian officials. The move essentially gives the US veto power over Ukrainian targeting of Russia and is intended to convince the Biden administration that Ukraine would not use these new weapons to strike inside Russian territory, sources told CNN. The US has proved resistant to providing Ukraine with army tactical missile systems (ATACMS), surface-to-surface missiles that can fly about four times the distance of the rockets used by the Himars mobile systems the US began sending to Ukraine four months ago. Washington has argued that Kyiv\u2019s forces are doing well with the Himarks systems they currently have, and there are also concerns that providing ATACMS weapons would cross a red line in Moscow\u2019s eyes. One senior Ukrainian official said:  We essentially described exactly what specific targets we need to hit on our territory which are not reachable with what we have now. The categories of targets are clear and do not change.  The problem was for the US to \u201cget over the psychological threshold and approve the ATACMS capability\u201d, the official added.  Updated at 4.04pm BST    3.17pm   EU summons Russian ambassadors over 'illegal annexation' of Ukrainian regions  The EU has summoned Russia\u2019s top diplomat in Brussels in protest of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cillegal annexation\u201d of four Ukrainian territories. The move is part of a coordinated exercise with EU member states, Peter Stano, a foreign affairs spokesperson for the bloc, told AFP. EU countries began to summon Russian envoys on Friday after Putin formally claimed four regions of Ukraine as Russian territory. Stano told CNN:  In response to latest steps by Russia escalating even more its aggression against Ukraine \u2013 with sham referenda and illegal annexation of the Ukrainian territories \u2013 the EU summoned in coordinated manner the Russian ambassadors in the EU member states and to the EU institutions.  The coordinated move aims to \u201cconvey strong condemnation of these actions\u201d and demand the \u201cimmediate halt to steps undermining Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and violating UN Charter and international law\u201d, he added.  Updated at 5.02pm BST    2.51pm    Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry has said in a statement: \u201cThe state of Qatar is following with great concern the current developments in the Russian-Ukrainian crisis related to Russia\u2019s announcement of the annexation of Ukrainian lands, and stresses the need to respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, and to adopt dialogue as a way to resolve the crisis.\u201d Reuters reports Qatar added it was ready to contribute to international or regional efforts for an immediate peaceful resolution.  Updated at 3.15pm BST    2.31pm    Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said he has thanked Canada for supporting Ukraine\u2019s bid to join Nato in a call with his counterpart, M\u00e9lanie Joly. He tweeted:  In a call with M\u00e9lanie Joly, I thanked Canada for supporting Ukraine\u2019s bid to join Nato, discussed further steps on this path. M\u00e9lanie affirmed Canada\u2019s readiness to strengthen mine clearance support for Ukraine. We also discussed other security-related issues of mutual interest.    Updated at 2.36pm BST    2.22pm    While the exact borders that Russia is attempting to set within occupied Ukraine as its new external Russian Federation border remains unclear, there is also scant information about what will happen to the citizenship of those within the four areas Russia is claiming. Earlier today, Iryna Vereshchuk, minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, said on Telegram: \u201cA Russian passport is an enemy weapon and must be destroyed on our territory.\u201d She was announcing that a \u201cdraft law on criminal liability for forced Russian passporting\u201d had been approved, which was \u201caimed primarily at punishing the organisers of hostile passporting and their accomplices\u201d. Russian state media Tass is reporting that as part of the provisions of annexation approved today by Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament:  Citizens of Ukraine, other countries and stateless persons residing in new regions are recognised as citizens of Russia, except for those who within a month declare their desire to retain their existing citizenship or remain stateless.  Additionally, Tass is reporting that Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister Yevgeny Ivanov, when asked about the introduction of visas for citizens of Ukraine, told reporters on Monday: \u201cThere are no such plans.\u201d  Updated at 2.38pm BST    1.58pm    Ukraine\u2019s military has said its forces recaptured the village of Torske near Lyman in the Donetsk region on Sunday. Russian forces who have been forced to retreat towards Luhansk\u2019s city of Kreminna are being hit \u201cwith fire\u201d by Ukrainian missile units, artillery and air forces, according to Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern group of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. Cherevatyi said:  For them (Russian occupiers), it is now very important to keep Kreminna. After overcoming Kreminna, the armed forces of Ukraine will go to Svatovo, Rubizhne, and further on they will be able to liberate the Luhansk region.  He added that Ukrainian troops would be able to take back Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk if they take back the city of Kreminna.  Updated at 2.10pm BST    1.52pm    In the forest bordering the village of Zalissia, north-east of Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, a yellow painted wooden stake has been driven in the sandy ground next to a tree trunk shredded by a mine. A local man, Eduard, came into the forest to look for items looted from his home by Russian soldiers during their occupation of Zalissia early in the war amid the Kremlin\u2019s failed offensive against Kyiv when this forest was the front line. He triggered an OZM \u201cbounding\u201d anti-personnel mine rigged to tripwire and was killed in the blast.  While Russian trenches and foxholes are still visible among trees, these days the forest is busy with de-mining teams working with the British Halo Trust, a mine-clearing charity. Further incidents in late September underlined the risk: an ambulance ran over a mine near Balakliya, and four people walking in a forest near Chernihiv died after tripping a mine.  Even before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion earlier this year, de-miners were confronting a years-long effort to clear mines from Ukraine\u2019s east. The country was ranked fifth in the world for civilian casualties caused by mines and in the top three for anti-vehicle mine incidents. Local de-mining experts are warning that even if the war were to end tomorrow, it will take at least a decade to clear the threat. Read the full story here:      1.41pm    A video shows Ukrainian soldiers raising the national flag in Myrolyubivka after liberating the small settlement in the Kherson region. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Kyiv\u2019s forces have liberated Myrolyubivka and Arkhanhelske.      1.28pm      Updated at 1.32pm BST    1.26pm    Sweden\u2019s coastguard has said it can no longer see any leaks from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea. A smaller leak from the Nord Stream 2 was still visible during observations during an overflight on Monday morning, the coastguard said in a statement. It said:  The larger leak is now no longer visible on the surface while the smaller one instead has increased slightly.  The smaller leak was approximately 30 metres in diameter, it added. On Saturday, a spokesperson for the operator of the Nord Stream pipelines said the leaking from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline had stopped because an equilibrium had been reached between the gas and water pressure. Meanwhile, the Russian gas company Gazprom said gas had stopped leaking from three ruptured Nord Stream gas lines under the Baltic. It added that it might be possible to resume pumping through Nord Stream 2\u2019s remaining single line:  If a decision is made to start deliveries through Nord Stream 2\u2019s line B, natural gas will be pumped into the pipeline after the integrity of the system has been checked and verified by supervisory authorities.   Updated at 1.32pm BST    1.09pm    Lithuania\u2019s foreign ministry has declared the top Russian diplomat in the country, Sergey Ryabokon, a \u201cpersona non grata\u201d. Ryabokon, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the Russian embassy in Vilnius, has been given \u201cfive days to leave the country\u201d, according to a statement by the ministry. \u201cRecent actions and statements\u201d by Ryabokon were \u201cincompatible with his diplomatic status, and should be seen as interference in the host nation\u2019s domestic affairs and, therefore, a violation of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations\u201d, the statement continued. It added:  Lithuania\u2019s foreign ministry also strongly protested against the Russian president\u2019s decision of 30 September to illegally annex the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 parts of which were temporarily occupied by Russia.  Lithuania expelled Russia\u2019s ambassador to Vilnius in April and recalled its own, after Ukraine accused Russian forces of killing civilians in the town of Bucha.  Updated at 1.19pm BST    12.57pm   Russia\u2019s state Duma unanimously approves annexation of Ukrainian regions  The lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament, the state Duma, has approved laws on annexing four Ukrainian territories into Russia. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against President Vladimir Putin\u2019s bill and constitutional changes to incorporate the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk regions into Russia. Writing on Telegram, the parliament Speaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, said:  The decision was taken unanimously. There are 89 entities in the Russian Federation.  From the Financial Times\u2019 Max Seddon:  Lawmakers in the upper house, Russia\u2019s federation council, are expected to formalise the illegal annexation tomorrow.  Updated at 1.18pm BST    12.41pm    The Czech Republic has repeated a warning to its citizens to leave Russia amid a worsening security situation, its foreign ministry said. A statement on its website reads:  With regard to the ongoing military invasion by the Russian Federation in Ukraine and possible threat of the worsening of security in the country, especially for citizens of EU and Nato states, the Czech foreign ministry strongly urges against travel to Russian Federation territories. The Czech foreign ministry calls on citizens of the Czech Republic to leave the country.  The call mirrors similar recent recommendations by other European countries in the region including Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.  Updated at 2.01pm BST    12.31pm   Thousands called up by Russia sent home due to wrongful mobilisation, official says  Thousands of people called up to fight in Ukraine from a far eastern Russian region have been sent home due to wrongful mobilisation, according to a local official. In the Khabarovsk region around 8,500 kilometres (5,300 miles) east of Moscow, the governor, Mikhail Degtyaryov, said an enlistment officer had been suspended for the wrongful mobilisation. Degtyaryov said in a Telegram video:  The military commissar of the Khabarovsk region, Yuri Laiko, has been suspended. This will have no impact on the fulfilment of the tasks that the president has set for us.  Degtyaryov did not specify the reason for the dismissal but mentioned a series of mistakes in the recruitment process. He continued:  Out of several thousand of our compatriots who had received a summons and arrived at military enlistment offices in the past 10 days, around half were sent back home for failing to meet the selection criteria.  He added:  Partial mobilisation should only apply to the categories that have been approved by the ministry of defence and the president. Any abuse must be stopped.   Updated at 12.45pm BST    12.14pm    The Kremlin\u2019s remarks that it will carry out consultations on defining the borders of the territories in Ukraine it is annexing serve to undermine Vladimir Putin\u2019s nuclear threats, our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth writes.  The Russian leader vowed on Friday to \u201cprotect\u201d the newly annexed lands \u201cwith all the forces and means at our disposal\u201d.      11.49am    Here\u2019s more from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov\u2019s briefing earlier, when he said Russia favours a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d to the issue of nuclear weapons that is not based on emotion. It comes after Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-appointed leader of the Chechnya region, said Moscow should consider using a \u201clow-yield\u201d nuclear weapon in Ukraine. After Russia confirmed the loss of its stronghold of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, Kadyrov criticised top commanders for the defeat and wrote on Telegram:  In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.  Asked about Kadyrov\u2019s comments, Peskov said the Chechnyan leader and Putin ally had the right to voice his opinion, but that Russia\u2019s military approach should not be driven by emotions. Peskov told reporters:  This is a very emotional moment. The heads of regions have the right to express their point of view. But even in difficult moments, emotions should be kept out of any kind of assessment. So we prefer to stick to balanced, objective assessments.  The basis for any use of nuclear weapons was set down in Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, he added, under which they are permitted if nuclear weapons or another weapon of mass destruction are used against Russia, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons. Peskov added:  There can be no other considerations when it comes to this.   Updated at 12.31pm BST    11.33am   Kremlin unclear on which parts of Ukraine it is annexing  Three days after its president, Vladimir Putin, signed \u201caccession treaties\u201d formalising Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of four occupied regions in Ukraine, the Kremlin said it would need to carry out consultations on defining the borders of two of the territories. During his regular briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the borders of the Russian-occupied southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were not yet determined. Peskov said:  We will continue to consult with people who live in these areas.  He added that he could not specify what format the consultation would take.  Confusion abounds as Russia seems unable to confirm whether it is claiming all of the occupied regions in Ukraine or only those portions controlled by its forces. Last week, Moscow formally claimed to annex four Ukrainian territories \u2013 Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk \u2013 but none are fully under the control of its forces and Ukraine continues to advance in the south. Since Putin\u2019s \u201cannexation\u201d ceremony on Friday, Ukrainian forces have made significant gains including fully recapturing the key eastern city of Lyman, as well as the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region. Hello everyone, it\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong here. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email.  Updated at 12.40pm BST    11.02am   Summary of the day so far \u2026   Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed Ukraine has \u201cfully cleared\u201d Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. Ukraine\u2019s president thanked serving Ukrainian troops for liberating Lyman. Lyman\u2019s recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia\u2019s largest battlefield loss since Ukraine\u2019s lightning counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in September. Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region. Along with Lyman, Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region as well, Zelenskiy said. Kirill Stremousov, who is deputy head of the Russian-imposed authority in occupied Kherson, has said that \u201ceverything is under control\u201d in the region. However, on Russian state TV Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Russian-imposed authority in the region, admitted that Ukrainians had gained some ground. \u201cIt\u2019s tense, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d he said. The Kremlin said on Monday that it will consult with residents living in two of the Ukrainian regions it moved to annex last week \u2013 Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 on how their borders should be defined. Russia does not control the whole territory of any of the four occupied regions of Ukraine it said it would incorporate into the Russian Federation. Russia\u2019s parliament will consider on Monday the bills and ratification treaties to absorb the regions, the speaker of Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin has said. Chechen leader and Vladimir Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov has said that his three underage sons are heading to fight in Ukraine. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, has said a 48-year-old woman was killed after Ukrainian forces fired over the border into the village of Golovchino. The British government\u2019s ability to investigate the true ownership of properties has come into question after researchers found \u00a3700m of luxury homes previously linked to sanctioned oligarchs were not flagged for asset freezes. The US and its allies would destroy Russia\u2019s troops and equipment in Ukraine and sink its Black Sea fleet if Russia uses nuclear weapons in the country, former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus warned on Sunday.  That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly.     10.37am    The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has published its latest map of how it believes the war is going on the ground.   Updated at 10.46am BST    10.35am   Kremlin will consult with residents of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia on how to define borders  The Kremlin said on Monday that it will consult with residents living in two of the Ukrainian regions it moved to annex last week \u2013 Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 on how their borders should be defined. \u201cWe will continue to consult with people who live in these areas\u201d, Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov telling reporters. Russia formally claimed to annex four Ukrainian territories last week, but none are fully under the control of Moscow\u2019s forces and Ukraine continues to advance in the south. It raises the possibility that the move to annex the four regions marks a halt to any further Russian ambition to take Ukrainian territory beyond their existing borders, and instead Moscow may concentrate on simply holding the land it already has, and imposing new borders that would de facto split the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts into Ukrainian-held and Russian-held zones.  Updated at 10.47am BST    10.31am    Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency is reporting that Chechen leader and Vladimir Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov has said that his three underage sons are heading to fight in Ukraine. It reports Kadyrov saying on Telegram:  A minor age should not interfere with the training of the defenders of our Motherland. Akhmat, Eli and Adam are 16, 15 and 14 years old respectively. But their military training began a long time ago, almost from an early age. And I\u2019m not joking. The time has come to show themselves in a real battle, and I only welcome their desire. Soon they will go to the frontline and will be on the most difficult sections of the line of contact.   Updated at 10.47am BST    9.57am   Russian-imposed leader says military situation is 'tense' in occupied Kherson  Kirill Stremousov, who is deputy head of the Russian-imposed authority in occupied Kherson, has said that \u201ceverything is under control\u201d in the region on Telegram, despite the reports that Ukraine has made some advances in the area. He posted:  Everything is under control in the Mykolaiv direction, despite attempts by the Ukronazis to break through the defences. The Nazis advanced along the Dnieper in the direction of Dudchan and there they received gifts from the Russian Aerospace Forces. At the moment the situation is completely under control.  In a subsequent post he added:  We are on the ground and continue to take care of the citizens of the Russian Federation of the Kherson region. We are now Russia and everything will be fine.  However, Reuters reports that on Russian state TV Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Russian-imposed authority, admitted that Ukrainians had gained some ground in the region.  \u201cIt\u2019s tense, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d he said.      9.05am    Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Donetsk, has reported on Telegram that at least one person is trapped under rubble in an educational establishment in Chasiv Yar after Russian shelling. The claim has not been independently verified.     8.17am   Zelenskiy: Ukraine has made gains in Kherson as well as Donetsk  Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine is not just experiencing military success in Lyman, but also in Kherson. In his overnight statement, he said Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region. Ukraine has also pushed to regain some territory within the region of Luhansk. This means that Russia does not hold the full territory of any of the areas of occupied Ukraine that it announced it would annex on Friday.  Zelenskiy also overnight reiterated Ukraine\u2019s pledge to punish those who had taken part in organising \u201creferendums\u201d on Ukrainian soil. In a Telegram message, he said:  Recently, someone somewhere held pseudo-referendums, and when the Ukrainian flag is returned, no one remembers the Russian farce with some pieces of paper and some annexations. Except, of course, law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. Because everyone who is involved in any elements of aggression against our state will be accountable for it.   Updated at 10.48am BST    7.54am    Ukraine\u2019s governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has posted to Telegram that in the last 24 hours two civilians were hospitalised \u201cas a result of Russian shelling\u201d. He also said that \u201cin the Izium district near Balakliia, an emergency medical vehicle was blown up by a mine. Unfortunately, the 60-year-old driver died. A 23-year-old paramedic was injured.\u201d He said that another 26-year-old man was injured by a landmine in the Kharkiv district, and that \u201c569 explosive objects were neutralised by deminers of the state emergency service during the day\u201d. The claims have not been independently verified.  Updated at 8.06am BST    7.48am    Russian state-media Tass has reported that about 300 residents of Yakutia, called up during the partial mobilisation by mistake, have returned to the republic. Yakutia is a region in the far north-east of the Russian Federation.     7.39am    A rehabilitation centre where children with special needs study has been destroyed overnight by Russian shelling in the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Ukraine\u2019s governor for the region, Oleksandr Starukh. Starukh claimed \u201cabout 10 S300 missiles were launched\u201d at the region, but that there were no casualties. The claims have not been independently verified. Zaporizhzhia is one of the regions Russia announced it was annexing last week.  Updated at 8.07am BST    7.15am    Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, has posted to Telegram to say that Ukrainian forces fired on the village of Golovchino, which is over the border from Ukraine\u2019s Sumy and Kharkiv regions. He claims that a 48-year-old woman has been killed. The claims have not been independently verified.  This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog from London. You can contact me via martin.belam@theguardian.com      6.53am    A church reduced to rubble, a dog exploring the ruins of a village in Kharkiv region, and a Ukrainian soldier in a moment of rest \u2013 some of the latest images from the war.        6.44am    Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s unusually rapid acknowledgment of problems with Russia\u2019s partial mobilisation highlights the likely scale of dysfunction with the draft, the UK Ministry of Defence says. In its latest intelligence briefing, the MoD says officials have almost certainly drafted ineligible people, and will struggle to train the new recruits.   Updated at 8.08am BST    6.39am    Russian forces are continuing forced mobilisation efforts in the occupied territories of Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent reports.  Citing an update from Ukraine\u2019s Southern Operational Command, the Independent reported that Russian officials were making rounds to people\u2019s homes and compiling lists of men of conscript age.  Passing through checkpoints had also become increasingly complicated, with Russian forces requiring an extensive list of documents, conducting lengthy inspections of vehicles, removing gadgets, money, and other valuables, and often refusing to let vehicles through.     6.20am    Moscow\u2019s setbacks on the battlefield are causing it to lose control of Russia\u2019s \u201cinformation space\u201d, according to the Institute for the Study of War. In a special edition of its daily analysis, the thinktank found that Kremlin propagandists were departing from Moscow\u2019s preferred narrative and openly expressing disappointment with the conduct of Russia\u2019s partial mobilisation, while grieving the loss of the key city of Lyman.  Some guests on heavily edited Kremlin television shows that aired on October 1 even criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to annex four Ukrainian oblasts before securing their administrative borders or even the frontline, expressing doubts about Russia\u2019s ability ever to occupy the entirety of these territories.      6.15am    Along with Lyman, Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region as well, Reuters has reported Volodymyr Zelenskiy as saying. Ukraine\u2019s Interfax agency reported that according to Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Ukraine\u2019s forces recaptured Torske, a village in the Donetsk region, about 15km (nine miles) east of the now-liberated Lyman.  Updated at 6.24am BST    6.08am    Russia\u2019s parliament will consider on Monday bills and ratification treaties to absorb the regions annexed by President Vladimir Putin, the speaker of Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin says. The areas Putin claimed as annexed just over seven months into Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbour \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk plus Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - are equal to about 18% of Ukraine\u2019s total surface land area.A pomp-filled Kremlin signing ceremony with the regions\u2019 Russian-installed leaders on Friday failed to stem a wave of criticism within Russia of how its military operation is being handled.     6.05am    The British government\u2019s ability to investigate the true ownership of properties has come into question after researchers found \u00a3700m of luxury homes previously linked to sanctioned oligarchs are not flagged for asset freezes. The campaign group Transparency International UK has identified 33 houses, flats and office blocks in London or Surrey that are not marked as restricted on the UK property register, which it says have been publicly linked to sanctioned individuals, raising questions about whether they should have been flagged. You can read the full story here:      5.49am    The Ukrainian advance in Donetsk is bringing the city of Sloviansk back to life, the Guardian\u2019s Peter Beaumont reports.  For the city of Sloviansk, the recapture of the strategic hub of Lyman about 12 miles away by Ukrainian forces has brought a new mood of optimism. The Donbas city was once one of Russia\u2019s main objectives along with neighbouring Kramatorsk. On Sunday as a continuous stream of military traffic was visible leaving Sloviansk in the direction of Lyman, the impact of the fall of the strategic railway junction was already transforming Sloviansk, a place that for months has been a ghost city.  You can read the full report here:      5.45am    Lyman\u2019s recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia\u2019s largest battlefield loss since Ukraine\u2019s lightning counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in September. Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region. Control over Lyman could prove a \u201ckey factor\u201d in helping Ukraine reclaim lost territory in the neighbouring Luhansk region, whose full capture Moscow announced in early July after weeks of grinding advances, Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Lyman\u2019s operational importance was due to its command over a road crossing over the Siverskyi Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence said. \u201cThanks to the successful operation in Lyman we are moving towards the second north-south route...and that means a second supply line will be disrupted,\u201d said reserve colonel Viktor Kevlyuk at Ukraine\u2019s Centre for Defence Strategies thinktank. \u201cAnd in that case, the Russian group in Luhansk and Donetsk could only be supplied strictly through (Russia\u2019s) Rostov region,\u201d Kevlyuk told media outlet Espreso TV. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding filed this report from Kyiv:       5.41am    The recapture of Lyman had become the most popular story in the media, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy noted in his Sunday evening address. \u201cBut the successes of our soldiers are not limited to Lyman,\u201d he added. \u201cAt least twice a day \u2013 in the morning and in the evening \u2013 I receive reports from our military. This week, the largest part of the reports is the list of settlements liberated from the enemy as part of our ongoing defence operation,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I am optimistic and very motivated,\u201d a 33-year-old Ukrainian soldier told Agence France-Presse after returning from near Lyman. \u201cI see the activity on the front line, and how foreign weapons ... help us take our lands back.\u201d     5.31am   David Petraeus's warning to Moscow  The US and its allies would destroy Russia\u2019s troops and equipment in Ukraine and sink its Black Sea fleet if Russian president Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons in the country, former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus warned on Sunday. Petraeus told ABC News said that he had not spoken to national security adviser Jake Sullivan on the likely US response to nuclear escalation from Russia, which administration officials have said has been repeatedly communicated to Moscow. \u201cJust to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a Nato \u2013 a collective \u2013 effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea,\u201d Petraeus said. The Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore filed this report:   Updated at 5.40am BST    5.31am   Summary and welcome  Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. At 7.30am Kyiv time, these are the latest developments:  The US and its allies would destroy Russia\u2019s troops and equipment in Ukraine and sink its Black Sea fleet if Russian president Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons, former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus said on Sunday. Petreaus said that he had not spoken to national security adviser Jake Sullivan on the likely US reaction, but he told ABC News that he believed a nuclear attack by Russia in Ukraine would trigger a Nato response led by the US. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to, again, get into a nuclear escalation here. But you have to show that this cannot be accepted in any way,\u201d Petraeus said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed Ukraine has \u201cfully cleared\u201d Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. In a short video clip on his Telegram channel, Ukraine\u2019s president thanked serving Ukrainian troops for liberating Lyman. The UK Ministry of Defence has described the city of Lyman as strategically crucial, owing to its \u201ckey road crossing over the Siversky Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Smyhal, says that 900 Ukrainian teachers have volunteered to join Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces to fight against Russia\u2019s invasion since 24 February. \u201cThis is a great example of serving your people,\u201d he said. The body of Paul Urey, a British aid volunteer who died after being captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine has been returned to the UK. Urey\u2019s family raised \u00a39,000 to repatriate his body after the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it was unable to pay the transport costs. A leading UK charity that has been helping the government rematch Ukrainian refugees with hosts after initial placements end or break down is to scale back its operations because it says the scheme is unworkable. Hosting arrangements are for a minimum of six months and many are coming to an end after the scheme opened in March. Ukrainian forces shot down eight Iranian-made kamikaze drones on Sunday, according to the Kyiv Independent. According to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Ukraine\u2019s air force also carried our four strikes that hit two Russian weapon stockpiles, as well as two anti-aircraft missile systems. US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin has said that he believes Ukraine is \u201cmaking progress\u201d in the war. In a CNN interview that aired on Sunday, Austin attributes the changing tide of war to the calibre of Ukrainian soldiers and their use of weapons provided to them by the US and Nato countries. Ukraine is starting to believe it can take back Crimea, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s top representative in the region. While there\u2019s no suggestion that Ukraine is close to being in a position to regain the annexed region, Tamila Tasheva and her team spend their days discussing the logistics of what would happen should Kyiv regain control. The nine European countries who issued a statement earlier to condemn Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine were all signalling their support for Ukraine to join Nato. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia were backing a path for Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership in their slightly opaque joint statement. The Associated Press has found evidence of 10 torture sites in the city of Izium, following Russia\u2019s retreat. \u201cThe AP spoke to 15 survivors of Russian torture in the Kharkiv region, as well as two families whose loved ones disappeared into Russian hands,\u201d the AP reported. Russia\u2019s constitutional court has recognised the annexation of four key Ukrainian territories as lawful. The court has effectively rubber stamped the annexation accords signed by Vladimir Putin with the Moscow-backed leaders of the regions, despite widespread condemnation by the West. Germany, Denmark and Norway have commissioned a batch of long-range weapons to be built for Ukraine. The supply of 16 Slovak Zuzana-2 howitzers, just announced by the German defence ministry, will begin next year. The gas leaks on the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline have now stopped. This follows Saturday\u2019s announcement that gas was no longer flowing out of Nord Stream 2. Denmark\u2019s energy agency said on Sunday it had been informed by Nord Stream AG that stable pressure had been achieved in the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline and that this indicates the outflow of natural gas from the last leaks had now halted, Reuters reports.

                    "body": "\n 10.18pm  \n\nWe are closing this blog now. Thanks for following along with us. You can read all our politics here .\n\n\n\n 9.55pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.44pm  \n\nAs you all catch your breath from that on the edge of your seat viewing, some reaction from the commentariat.\nLiz Truss did seem more human and compared to previous hustings, where she was criticised for being robotic. She seemed to go down better in the room, from what could be gathered from watching online, but it is backed up by people in Leeds tonight.\nSunak still has a long way to go. The next hustings is in the cathedral city of Exeter next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.28pm  \n\nTruss says that shortages of labour are the same across the world, in the US and Canada and not down to Brexit.\n\u201cIn Europe they are also struggling to get workers on their farms as well. We have the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. I talked about my passion for British food, and I think it\u2019s right we open up for these workers.\u201d\nThen a question about child benefits, and the threshold being \u00a350k where if one of the parents get that income, they no longer qualify.\nTruss repeats that she wants to reform the tax system. \u201cWe need to make sure it works with things like child benefit, but we need to simplify the system.\u201d\nShe is then asked if Jeremy Hunt would get a job in her cabinet, she declines to answer but says jobs will be given out on the basis of whether they can do the job.\nFinal question, after the two hour marathon is about the difference between pensioners who have the triple lock on their pensions and younger people who are harder hit by the cost of living crisis.\nTruss says she wants to get more people working part time, including retired people. \u201cThere are lots of roles that people can take up, and make a huge contribution to our society. People are living longer and one of the best things that David Cameron did was remove the compulsory retirement age.\u201d\nThe foreign secretary then finishes up by reiterating her reforms to the planning system and housebuilding. And that\u2019s it.\n\nUpdated at 9.37pm BST\n\n\n 9.25pm  \n\nAfter a question about local authorities, Truss is challenged over her negative comments about the school she attended, which others have called inaccurate. \u201cYou make it sound like it\u2019s some bog-standard comprehensive, it\u2019s nothing like it,\u201d the questioner says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not claiming it was a sink school, it was an average comprehensive at the time. And at that average comprehensive under the auspices of Leeds city council there were too many kids able to leave school without the education they need, the teaching was patchy, we didn\u2019t have league tables at the time, or a national curriculum, there were kids who fell through the cracks.\n\u201cThere were low expectations of some of the pupils at the school, and sometimes those low expectations were about where those kids had come from in Leeds. There were different expectations from the kids from the middle class areas, than who had come from the council estate. I thought that was wrong.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.27pm BST\n\n\n 9.20pm  \n\nA question about mixed-sex toilets in schools, with an audience member saying that a lot of changes were made in schools during Covid closures, and that girls\u2019 toilets were removed.\nTruss replies: \u201cI agree with you, I have sought to clarify that as women\u2019s minister. I have been very clear that single sex spaces should be protected, particularly for young people, as well as vulnerable people, vulnerable women in domestic violence shelters, and I can assure you as prime minister, I would direct that to happen.\n\u201cOur girls, it\u2019s a difficult time being a teenager, being a young girl and you should be able to have the privacy you need in your own loo.\u201d\nTruss says that she doesn\u2019t believe teenagers should be able to make \u201cirreversible decisions to do with their own bodies that they might later regret\u201d. She adds that schools can provide additional facilities, but not by taking away single-sex toilets.\n\nUpdated at 9.27pm BST\n\n\n 9.16pm  \n\nTruss backs more investment and transport links in the north. \nIn response to a following question, she says that she was sceptical about HS2, but now it is going ahead there needs to be a focus on value for money. \nShe adds that it needs to be done quicker, now we are out of the EU, and that different procurement rules have slowed us down.\nThen a question about energy supply, and fracking. Truss says she supports it in areas where people want it to happen, and it can be part of the future for energy in the UK, in conjunction with nuclear power.\n\n\n\n 9.12pm  \n\nIn response to an opening question about how to support children who suffered through the pandemic, Truss says that support wil be given to early years. \n\u201cWe need kids who get to school to be able to count, to be able to read, to be able to do all those basic things to be able to benefit from a primary education.\u201d\nShe adds she will push for education standards over English and maths to be improved.\nTruss goes on to say that there should be more mental health support available in schools for children.\nShe says that she would not have closed schools during Covid. \u201cThere was a time where we kept pubs open but closed schools.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.13pm BST\n\n\n 9.08pm  \n\nTruss says the attempt to rewrite parliamentary rules to try and support Owen Paterson was a mistake and she wouldn\u2019t do it again, if similar circumstances repeated themelves. She adds that there needs to be more support for MPs.\nAfter questions about Johnson\u2019s support for Ukraine, and a prediction for the women\u2019s Euros final on Sunday that\u2019s it for Ferrari\u2019s questions. On to the audience now.\n\nUpdated at 9.10pm BST\n\n\n 9.06pm  \n\nTruss is asked about company profits, and is asked about windfall taxes. She says she doesn\u2019t support another one as it puts off investment.\nShe said she would be encouraging Shell and other companies to invest in the UK to improve productivity. She would create low-tax investment zones to encourage more investment.\nTruss seems to be addressing the audience as well as Ferrari, more than Sunak was doing earlier.\n\n\n\n 9.03pm  \n\nFerrari brings up her previous republicanism and asks what happens if the Queen asks about it during their first audience.\n\u201cAlmost as soon as I made the speech I regretted it. I was a bit of a teenage controversialist. \n\u201cWithin these four walls, I was briefly a member of the Liberal Democrats, I did leave it when I was 21 when I came of age and realised the error of my ways.\u201d\nTruss said that Margaret Thatcher was the best Conservative PM, after \u201cturning around the country ... as the sick man of Europe\u201d.\n\u201cWhat I sensed in the 1980s was a growing sense of pride in our country and a growing sense of optimism in our future. I think the pinnacle was when we saw the Berlin Wall fall. When we saw the freedom and democracy and pride in our values influencing the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.12pm BST\n\n\n 9.01pm  \n\nOn to the yes or no questions.\nIs Love Island misogynistic, Ferrari asks. Truss says she watched it recently with her daughter and was horrified but does not answer the question directly.\nThen Ferrari asks if England and Wales should boycott the World Cup in Qatar, after previously backing a boycott of the Champions League final in Moscow. She says not. \n\u201cIf we insisted that every contry we traded with, or did business with, or attended a football match in, had the same standards as the United Kingdom, we wouldn\u2019t be doing business with many countries. We need to be pragmatic. What Russia did to Ukraine was beyond the pail.\u201d\nTruss then says she has never used illegal drugs.\n\n\n\n 8.58pm  \n\nFerrari asks Truss if her plans really add up.\nShe says all of her tax reductions are costed. \n\u201cThere is \u00a330bn in the budget, and we will be able to start paying down debt in three years. It\u2019s a false economy to raise taxes when it can cut off growth, we know that, we know what Britain was like in the 1970s with high taxes and militant trade unions. I didn\u2019t agree with those people who say you can keep raising tax and the money will keep rolling in.\u201d\nShe says people won\u2019t want to work and won\u2019t invest if taxes stay high.\n\nUpdated at 8.59pm BST\n\n\n 8.55pm  \n\nTruss says that the tax system in the UK is too complicated, in response to a question about inheritance tax. It needs to be fairer, she says, and would look at inheritance tax.\n\u201cI\u2019d look at the overall tax system in the round and make sure it\u2019s fair. We need to reward people who do the right thing, who set up businesses, who earn money and want to pass it on to their children.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.54pm  \n\nFerrari asks who was better, Theresa May or Boris Johnson after Truss served both of them.\n\u201cPut it this way, in the 2016 leadership election after the referendum I backed Boris first, then I backed Theresa May once Boris had left the race. I\u2019ve always been a fan of Boris Johnson, I think he did a fantastic job as prime minister, he delivered Brexit, he delivered on the vaccine and I was proud to serve as a loyal member of his cabinet.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.00pm BST\n\n\n 8.52pm  \n\nLiz Truss now in the hot seat, with Nick Ferrari kicking things off by asking if there is a risk of Truss accidentally walking the UK into a nuclear war, after Vladimir Putin put his forces on high alert after her comments earlier this year.\nShe says: \u201cThe fact that Russia have spread propaganda about me, is I think a sign that the strength the United Kingdom has shown in leading the free world in the fight against Russia and supporting Ukraine has had a real impact. \n\u201cI take it as a badge of honour that I have been sanctioned by the Russian regime. We have stood up to Russia, we have encouraged our allies in the free world to stand up to this appalling regime. It\u2019s completely wrong to listen to any of the sabre-rattling or propaganda. The reason they are doing this is that Putin\u2019s evil plans to take Kyiv in a few days didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.02pm BST\n\n\n 8.49pm  \n\nSunak finishes up after questions about the benefits system, which he says he would tighten up, and about appointing William Hague, his predecessor in Richmond, as Conservative party chair. \nSunak says he doesn\u2019t think the former Tory leader would be interested.\n\n\n\n 8.45pm  \nSunak accused of 'stabbing Johnson in the back'\n\nAnother audience member accuses Sunak of \u201cstabbing Johnson in the back\u201d over his resignation. He asks how will take the party through the next general election.\nSunak says he didn\u2019t stab Johnson in the back. \u201cThere was a speech that was due to be given and it was clear we had very different points of view.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cIt was a very difficult decision - it wasn\u2019t one I took lightly. I am very grateful to the PM for making me chancellor. I gave everything for that job and delivering for you and getting through coronavirus and I do think he was the only person who could have broken the Brexit gridlock. \n\u201cIt got for me personally to a position where I couldn\u2019t stay. I had a significant difference of opinion in the challenges ahead of us, and there was no way I could stay. There is no way a chancellor and a PM cannot be joined at the hip. I had no choice but to resign and that was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.46pm BST\n\n\n 8.39pm  \n\nSunak says he would be firm with <b>Nicola Sturgeon</b> about another referendum. He says that the government should not just \u201cdevolve and forget\u201d with ministers needing to be \u201cmore active\u201d in Scotland.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just talk in arguments to do with our head. Nationalism is a seductive and romantic idea. We have got to make arguments about the union that speaks to people\u2019s hearts and their emotions. If we focus on the practicalities we will not be successful.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.35pm  \n\nA councillor in Selby asks about keeping small business relief to help support shops.\nSunak says he will. He refers to his \u201chelp to grow\u201d programme among other initiatives he introduced as chancellor.\nTheresa then asks about controlling illegal immigration with small boats arriving from France.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I want to grip as quickly as possible as PM. Some of the things we need to do quickly; we need to change the definition from what counts as asylum and move away from the very expansive ECHR definition where people can claim all sorts of reasons for being here, and move towards the refugee convention definition which is tighter.\n\u201cWe should make our foreign policy more linked to taking back failed asylum seekers. If we are going to provide aid to countries, we should be linking it to taking back asylum seekers we want to make sure aren\u2019t here any more. We need to improve the current system to get through it. We need to look at our rates of objection and acceptance. For some reason we reject far fewer asylum seekers than other countries.\u201d\nSunak says he will make the Rwanda policy work, and believes it is workable in the long term.\n\nUpdated at 8.36pm BST\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\nSunak is now taking questions from the audience. Laura up first. \nShe asks a left-field one to get the ball rolling: if greyhound racing will be banned on animal rights grounds.\nHe says he hasn\u2019t ever looked at it in great detail.\n\nUpdated at 8.33pm BST\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\nSunak says that \u2018Eat out to help out wasn\u2019t a mistake despite a rise in coronavirus infections. \u201cEvery country in Europe ended up having the same spike thereafter, every single one, and they ended up putting more restrictions in place afterwards. It\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s the difference.\u201d\nHe says it helped protect jobs in hospitality, who are younger and on lower incomes. More applause.\nSunak is asked what he would say to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, to try and attract his support. He won\u2019t give a figure on increases to defence spending, saying he doesn\u2019t believe in \u201carbitary targets\u201d.\nHe says: \u201cI was a chancellor who supported Ben in the largest uplift in [defence] spending since the cold war, and we did that before we settled any other department in the middle of Covid, I was also the chancellor who ensured we supported Ben to get \u00a32bn of aid to Ukraine to stand up to Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.32pm BST\n\n\n 8.22pm  \n\nA question from Ferrari on image: Sunak is told he has Prada shoes, a photo opportunity with a car he doesn\u2019t own, he pours pints for cameras despite being teetotal, and has a green card despite living in Downing Street. Ferrari asks what people should make of this.\n\u201cThis is not about what shoes I wear, it\u2019s about what I want to do in Downing Street,\u201d he says. This gets the most applause he\u2019s had this evening. \n\nUpdated at 8.27pm BST\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\nFerrari says that about 14,000 members of the Conservative party want Johnson back on the ballot. This gets support and applause from the audience. He asks what Sunak thinks of this.\n\u201cClose to 60 people resigned in parliament, it\u2019s incumbent on the prime minister to have the confidence of the parliamentary party,\u201d Sunak says. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t there at the end. Whether he\u2019s on the ballot or not, you have to command the confidence of your MPs, and we got to a position where 60 of them resigned from government.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.26pm BST\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\nFerrari asks about using Boris Johnson as an envoy to Ukraine, after Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s praise for him. He asks whether the former chancellor would give him a role in his government. Sunak says he wouldn\u2019t offer him a job in the cabinet.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he would want to do it ... I\u2019m not going to sit here and allocate jobs to people, but I do think we need to move forward, I don\u2019t see that being a role in the cabinet for Boris, but I do think he\u2019ll have a role in public life. He\u2019s an extraordinary figure and I\u2019m sure he has a lot more to give.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\nFerrari asks how striking workers would be tackled. Sunak says there should be a legal minimum level of service for critical industries including rail.\n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\nSome quick-fire questions from Ferrari: firstly Sunak says he would support the return of grammar schools, adding it\u2019s in line with his prioritisation of education that he mentioned in his stump speech.\nWhen Ferrari talks about water company directors going to jail in response to pollution, Sunak demures and says they should be \u201cheld to a high standard\u201d, but doesn\u2019t say they should go to prison.\nSunak then says he has never used illegal drugs, in response to a final question.\n\nUpdated at 8.19pm BST\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\nFerrari asks that with the economic sitaution so dire, why should people trust Sunak.\nSunak says that the UK had a faster recovery than other countries from Covid. \n\u201cIf you look at it over the period, we are actually very much in line or to the top end of the G7. Of course I want to see growth. We have to look at how we do that. We\u2019ve had a very narrow conversation about tax, and in a 21st-century economy there is many more things we have to get right.\u201d\nSunak talks about financial markets reform, about a visa regime for migrant workers, and reviewing regulation to support entrepreneurs. The former chancellor says he wants to get more investment in the economy. \nIn response to another question he says that Margaret Thatcher was the best Conservative prime minister. Ferrari asks what her reaction would have been to Sunak raising corporation tax. \n\u201cIf you look at her early budgets and what we had to do as a country, she understood that you had to get a grip of inflation first, and public spending and borrowing. Her mantra was to do that first, because if inflation had run out of control, it would have been far worse for the economy. It was only after that was under control that she embarked on a plan of supply-side reform,\u201d he says.\nHe adds that he would cut tax on business investment, which gets applause.\n\nUpdated at 8.18pm BST\n\n\n 8.07pm  \n\nLBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari takes the stage now, ready to ask questions of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. \nFerrari speaks to Sunak first. he asks if he has done a U-turn over VAT on energy bills after saying it was \u201cunconservative\u201d.\n\u201cNo, definitely not. There\u2019s two very different things here. We have a short term problem with energy bills. We need to make sure that the support with energy bills is appropriate fo rthe scale for the challenge millions of households are facing.\n\u201cWe announced support earlier this year for people after it was announced that energy bills will get to \u00a32,800. For the most vulnerable families, that gets to about \u00a31,200 of help. Now, people\u2019s expectations of what will happen to energy bills has gone up. It is reasonable that there is more we can do.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a temporary and time limited support to help people.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.55pm  \n\nAnother Yorkshire line from Liz Truss, who says that the Conservatives need to summon the spirit of former Leeds United manager Don Revie, who went on to have a chequered spell as England manager after leaving Elland Road.\n\u201cWe need to win. My friends, we can win against Keir Starmer, who is a patronising, plastic patriot. He is beatable, but he is only beatable if we deliver. I can assure you, if you select me, if you elect me, I will work my socks off in No 10 to deliver all of the promises we made in 2019 and to deliver a victory for the Conservatives in 2024.\u201d\nThat\u2019s it for Truss\u2019s speech, there\u2019s a break now for a few minutes before it resumes with a question and answer session.\n\nUpdated at 8.14pm BST\n\n\n 7.53pm  \n\nTruss said that people should be encouraged to \u201clove their country\u201d, after more references to straight-talking people in Yorkshire, free-speech and people knowing \u201ca woman is a woman\u201d. \nShe adds that people need to be proud to be Conservative. \u201cThe people who voted for us in 2019 in seats like Keighley or Dewsbury, they didn\u2019t vote for us because they wanted Labour policies. They were fed up of Labour and Labour councils. They voted for us because they wanted opportunity and aspired to better things and aspired for better things in their area.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 7.56pm BST\n\n\n 7.50pm  \n\nTruss then turns to say that the UK needs to continue to stand up to Vladimir Putin, talking about the action that has been taken so far. \n\u201cI will not let up until Ukraine prevails and Putin fails.\n\u201cWe have to recognise that we need to spend more on defence. After the cold war we let our guard slip and alowed the aggressors to expand. That is why I would put defence spending up to 3% of GDP by the end of the decade. There is nothing more important than freedom and democracy.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 7.56pm BST\n\n\n 7.48pm  \n\nAfter being introduced by James Cleverly, and a promotional video being played, Liz Truss walks on to the stage, which is round with chairs surrounding it.\nTruss talks up her Leeds connections, among other things jokingly apologising to any former teachers of hers in the audience, saying she got \u201cgrit, determination and straight-talking\u201d from Yorkshire.\n\u201cThe fact is, we face a huge global economic crisis. We have the worst war that has taken place on European shores happening in Ukraine. Now is not the time for business as usual. Now is not the time for the status quo, we need to be bold and do things differently.\u201d\nShe said she would reverse the increases in national insurance, stop the green levy on fuel bills, and not increase corporation tax in an attempt to encourage investment. Truss said she would abolish \u201cSoviet-style\u201d housing targets.\n\u201cI believe that we need to be on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing. People who save their money, people who start their own businesses, the self-employed, people who go into work every day. That\u2019s whose side I\u2019m on,\u201d she said.\nTruss says she will give power back to local people over planning, saying rules should not be the same in London as Yorkshire or Cornwall. She goes on to refer to the transport system in Leeds, saying it is the same as it was when she was a teenager. The foreign secretary repeats her pledge to go ahead with Northern Powerhouse Rail.\n\nUpdated at 7.59pm BST\n\n\n 7.42pm  \n\nSunak, speaking without notes, says borrowing is \u201cnot Conservative\u201d, referring to Liz Truss\u2019 plans, and adds that he will cut taxes for both people and business. \nHe says that he will take advantage of the benefits of Brexit, including reforming regulation in financial services, data and life sciences. \nThe former chancellor says that the Conservatives need to win a fifth election term. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge but I know we can do it together. But in order to do it, we will have to appeal to swing voters in every part of our country, north and south, remain and leave, urban and rural, Scotland and Wales, and I believe with all my heart, I am the person, I am the candidate, that gives our party the best opportunity to secure that victory and ensure that the Labour party and Keir Starmer never walk through the doors of No 10 Downing Street.\u201d\nSunak admits he is the underdog, but compares his leadership candidacy to his attempt to become the candidate for Richmond seven years ago, when he became an MP. \n\u201cI promise you I am going to fight for every single vote. I am going to fight for the Conservative values that are core to who I am and what I stand for, and I am going to fight hard for the argument that we should not mortgage our children and grandchildren\u2019s future to make our lives easier for today.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.00pm BST\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nSunak continues: \n\u201cI want a Britain where the birthright of every child is a world-class education. A Britain which is built on hard work, aspiration and hope. A Britain where we lead the world in setting the standard for integrity, decency and leadership, and a Britain where we have enormous pride in our history and enormous confidence in our future.\u201d\nSunak adds that trust needs to be restored, saying he has not taken an easy road and has wanted to be honest about the challenges that Britain faces. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what leadership is about,\u201d he says.\nHe talks about his plans to tackle the NHS backlog, illegal immigration and address the cost-of-living crisis and soaring inflation.\n\u201cYes, this is a compassionate and welcoming country but we must also have control of our borders and as prime minister I will grip that problem and solve it and restore trust back in the system.\n\u201cWe need to grip inflation because it\u2019s the enemy that makes everyone poorer. It reduces their living standards and erodes their hard-earned savings. It pushes up mortgage rates, and I will grip inflation and get it back down.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.01pm BST\n\n\n 7.31pm  \n\nDavid Davis is addressing the members in Leeds, as the event is now running behind schedule. The former leadership candidate \u2013 he came second in 2005 \u2013 calls Rishi Sunak a \u201cman of great honesty and great integrity\u201d.\nSunak\u2019s first up. He says he\u2019s had the \u201ctime of his life\u201d in the last week as he\u2019s been travelling across the country talking to members. He then launches into his stump speech about his family background.\n\u201cI\u2019m standing before you all for one simple reason, that\u2019s because this country did something absolutely incredible for my family. It welcomed them here as immigrants 60 years ago, and allowed them to build a better life. My Dad was an NHS GP. My Mum ran the local chemist in Southampton where I grew up. They brought me up with a set of values that are absolutely core to who I am today.\n\u201cThe first of those values is that family means everything to me. The bonds of love, sacrifice, commitment that family brings are far greater than anything that any government could ever replicate, and nobody should ever forget that.\u201d\nHe says his values are patriotism, aspiration, hard work, education, family and service. Sunak says they are Conservative values. \u201cI want to put those Conservative values into action for this country,\u201d he says.\n\nUpdated at 8.02pm BST\n\n\n 7.07pm  \n\nA reminder of the format for tonight\u2019s hustings: each candidate will give a 10-minute speech to start, which will be followed by a Q&amp;A session. We\u2019re just waiting for it to get under way. \nIain Dale is currently talking about hosting the last hustings in 2019 on LBC, with his colleague Nick Ferrari in the chair tonight.\n\nUpdated at 7.27pm BST\n\n\n 7.02pm  \n\nRishi Sunak has accepted another interview offer from a broadcaster, which Liz Truss is yet to agree to.\nSunak will speak to Nick Robinson in a one-on-one interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme in August. \nAlthough the broadcaster said it hopes Truss will also take part in an interview with Robinson in August, the foreign secretary\u2019s campaign team has not yet confirmed if she will agree, PA Media reports.\nTruss has so far declined to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on Channel 4, while Sunak has agreed. \nThe BBC News press team said on Twitter: \u201cWe can confirm Rishi Sunak will take part in a one-to-one interview with Nick Robinson on Wednesday August 10. \n\u201cAs we announced last week, we\u2019ve invited both candidates to be interviewed and we hope Liz Truss will join us later in August.\u201d \n\nUpdated at 7.28pm BST\n\n\n 6.50pm  \n\nA Conservative party councillor who was at the same school as Liz Truss at the same time as her, is the latest to challenge her claim it \u201clet down\u201d children in Roundhay, a suburb in the north of the city.\nTruss went to Roundhay school, which is rated \u201coutstanding\u201d by Ofsted. She caused unhappiness with her recent assertion that it \u201clet down\u201d children and drove her to become a Conservative.\nVoters in Leeds told the Guardian this week that Truss was \u201cdelusional\u201d and that her claims were misleading. Another former pupil at the school at about the same time as Truss, the Guardian US\u2019s Martin Pengelly said she was misrepresenting her education.\nITV\u2019s Robert Peston spoke to Nathan Hull, a Tory councillor who went to Roundhay, outside the hustings in Leeds. He is supporting Rishi Sunak for the party\u2019s leadership. He said: \u201cI was in the year below Liz, and it was a fantastic school. My parents sent seven children there, every single child came out with a degree. \n\u201cI have a different recollection to the school she describes. It was a friendly place, first class education, brilliant teachers, the facilities were fantastic and everyone there was pretty pleased with the education they got.\n\u201cI disagreed with the whole sentiment of what she was saying. I don\u2019t feel the children were let down by the school.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 6.57pm BST\n\n\n 6.15pm  \n\nFormer cabinet minister David Gauke, has written a piece for the New Statesman (paywall) saying he can understand why Conservative party members like Liz Truss, but that electing her leader would be a gamble.\nGauke, who voted to remain in the EU and was kicked out of the Conservative party in 2019, losing as an independent in the general election later that year, said Truss is likeable and \u201cengaging\u201d.\nHe adds:\n\nHer political skills can be underrated. She can be perceptive \u2013 I recall her telling me about the UK\u2019s political realignment long before the idea became commonplace. In contrast to the current prime minister, she is not motivated by the desire to hold office for the sake of it but wishes to gain power because she wants to do things.\n\nHowever Gauke said he fears that her convictions and values might come unstuck in the current economic and political climate, and that her stubbornness might end up being fatal.\n\n The biggest risk of a prime minister Truss \u2013 and I think it is a very real and substantial risk \u2013 is that her determination is not tempered by realism and a willingness to listen to expert opinion. Conservative party members admire her ideological clarity, but they are taking the most enormous gamble on her judgement.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.58pm BST\n\n\n 5.54pm  \n\nCandidates have started arriving at the Centenary Pavilion, in Elland Road, for tonight\u2019s hustings. The venue is opposite Leeds United\u2019s historic football stadium.\nLiz Truss and Rishi Sunak will face questions from LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari from 7pm, in front of about 1,400 Conservative party members in the event hosted by the party. \nSunak earlier admitted he was the underdog in the contest, and polling has shown he is trailing his opponent with Tory members.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.08pm BST\n\n\n 5.15pm  \n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, told Times Radio this afternoon that Boris Johnson was entitled to mock Rishi Sunak earlier over his U-turn on removing VAT on fuel bills. (See 1pm.) Rees-Mogg said:\n\nI think the prime minister was puzzled as to why that wasn\u2019t policy earlier in the year when the prime minister and other members of the cabinet, including me, thought it was an extremely good idea but it wasn\u2019t so popular in 11 Downing Street.

My colleague Harry Taylor is taking over now.\n\n\n\n 4.58pm  \nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan says he has no objection in principle to joining picket line\n\nIn his LBC phone-in this morning, Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said he had no plans to join a picket line in the near future \u201csimply because of pressure of work and stuff\u201d. But he said he had no objection in principle to appearing on a picket line. Asked if he would join an RMT picket in the coming days, he said:\n\nI have in the past appeared on picket lines and I think it\u2019s really important to make sure we understand that actually the genesis of all these problems, the root cause of all these problems, are government policies. It\u2019s either the government pulling the strings of the rail companies or not giving \u2013 whether it\u2019s the rail companies, whether its TfL, whether it\u2019s the NHS, whether it\u2019s our schools \u2013 the money they need to give their workers a decent pay rise.\n\nKhan said unions had been \u201ca core force for good to our country over the recent weeks, months and years\u201d and, as an example, he said everyone had benefited from what they had done during the pandemic to keep public transport safe.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.24pm BST\n\n\n 4.35pm  \nSunak and Truss prepare for first official Tory hustings in Leeds tonight at 7pm\n\nRishi Sunak and Liz Truss are poised to go head to head in the first official hustings with Tory members in Leeds, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nIt is the first of 12 sessions for party faithful across the country to quiz the final two candidates before voting for the next party leader and prime minister closes on 2 September.\nThe two-hour hustings will be broadcast on LBC radio from 7pm and hosted by presenter Nick Ferrari.\nThe event takes place in Leeds, where Truss was hoping to shore up voters\u2019 support by backing Northern Powerhouse Rail in full and pledging to \u201cturbocharge investment\u201d into the north of England.\nDuring a visit to the Yorkshire city, Truss insisted she is \u201ccompletely committed\u201d to the scheme to improve rail connections between Liverpool and Leeds, which was originally announced by Boris Johnson but subsequently scaled back.\nShe told reporters: \u201cI grew up in Leeds, I know how poor the transport is and, frankly, it\u2019s not got much better since I was a teenager getting the bus into Leeds city centre. What I want to see is really fantastic rail services, better roads so people are able to get into work\u201d.\nAsked how she would afford the scheme, given the vast tax cuts she has pledged, Truss said: \u201cThe taxes that I am cutting are affordable within our budget. By creating new low-tax investment zones in places like West Yorkshire, by enabling the post-Brexit reforms to take place, unleashing more investment from the city, we will grow the economy faster - that will bring in more tax revenue, and that will enable us to afford those projects\u201d.\nShe also promised to \u201cfix the Treasury\u2019s funding formula\u201d if she gets the keys to No 10 to make sure the region gets a \u201cfairer share\u201d of resources.\nTruss took a thinly veiled swipe at Sunak, who is the MP for the North Yorkshire seat of Richmond, when she was asked whether he was as committed to the rail project, saying: \u201cThe thing about me is I\u2019m prepared to take on the Whitehall orthodoxy, I\u2019m prepared to challenge the groupthink that has, over decades, not put enough investment into this part of the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nUpdated at 5.25pm BST\n\n\n 4.17pm  \n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency and Brexit opportunities, has opened a government hub building in Birmingham that will house up to 1,700 civil servants, from 20 government departments. This is part of a project that will see jobs relocated outside London. Some 880 jobs have already been moved to the West Midlands, the Cabinet Office says, and 2,100 will be relocated by 2025.\nRees-Mogg said: \u201cThis hub is an important part of our plans to create a leaner and more efficient public estate, which will save taxpayers\u2019 money and serve the entire United Kingdom.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.12pm  \n'I think it\u2019s pretty clear I\u2019m the underdog' - Sunak admits Truss is ahead in Tory leadership contest\n\nThere are two long interviews with Rishi Sunak out today. He has spoken to Charles Moore for a Spectator interview, and to Andrew Gimson and William Atkinson for a ConservativeHome one. Here are the main points.\n\nSunak said the Conservative party should negotiate a protocol for leadership debates with broadcasters to minimise the risk of debates damaging the party\u2019s reputation. He told ConHome:\n\n\nI think there might be an argument for the party negotiating on behalf of all candidates together with the broadcasters. That might be a sensible thing if the party sets the rules of the contest in general.\nBecause there\u2019s two competing things we\u2019re trying to balance. One is a genuine need for scrutiny of candidates, and that is entirely reasonable and fair, because ultimately this person is going to become prime minister.\nBut that need for scrutiny needs to be balanced with need as well to make sure that our party is not doing things that essentially write Labour\u2019s next leaflets for them.\n\n\nHe implied that he would prefer to negotiate a solution to the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol with the EU than go ahead with implementing the NI protocol bill, that allows the UK government to unilaterally ignore parts of the protocol. He told the Spectator:\n\n\nThere are some very real challenges with the arrangements that are in place currently. I\u2019d like to see those fixed and the protocol bill gives us an opportunity to do that. But the door should always be there for a negotiated settlement with Europe, not least because it is a lot faster.\n\n\nHe refused to describe Boris Johnson as a liar in his Spectator interview, but, explaining why he resigning from government, he said Johnson was not telling the truth about the Chris Pincher affair. Asked if Johnson was lying, Sunak said:\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but it was clear to me that what was said was not accurately reflective of what seemed to have happened.\n\n\nSunak told the Spectator that his campaign launch video was put together in 24 hours. The video was so polished that it was widely assumed it could not have been produced that quickly. But Sunak told the Spectator:\n\n\nI can honestly say with hand on heart that that video was put together in 24 hours. And I get a lot of criticism when people say: \u2018Oh, gosh, it\u2019s all very slick and professional.\u2019 I think being professional is a good thing. I think being professional at things is something that we should celebrate and actually we need more of it.\n\n\nHe rejected claims that he was the candidate of orthodox thinking. He told the Spectator that, when economic orthodoxy said the government could go on borrowing lavishly because interest rates would stay low, he did not accept that, because he thought they were bound to rise.\n\n\nHe told ConHome that it was \u201cpretty clear\u201d that he was the underdog in the contest. He said:\n\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty clear I\u2019m the underdog. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt about that.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.27pm BST\n\n\n 2.46pm  \nTruss wins backing of NRG chair Jake Berry as she promises to build Northern Powerhouse Rail\n\nJake Berry, the Conservative MP who chairs the Northern Research Group, which represents Tory MPs in the north, has declared that he is backing Liz Truss for the leadership.\n\nHis endorsement coincides with Truss saying she will build Northern Powerhouse Rail if she becomes PM, as my colleague Josh Halliday reports.\n\n\n\n\n 2.27pm  \nBurnham says Starmer needs to be careful, following sacking of Sam Tarry, to ensure Labour still seen as party that sides with workers\n\nAndy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has expressed concern about Keir Starmer\u2019s decision to sack Sam Tarry. In an interview with GB News, Burnham said there was a risk of the party appearing not to be on the side of working people. Commenting on the sacking of Tarry, he said:\n\nLabour needs to be careful here. We can\u2019t ever be a party that undermines working people fighting to protect their incomes and a cost of living crisis.\nIf we\u2019re not careful, that\u2019s how we might come over. There\u2019s a real issue out there now for people in terms of wages and energy bills that keep rising. \nPeople are going to have to fight to protect their incomes and Labour should be supporting people to protect their incomes.\n\nStarmer insists that Tarry was sacked not because he showed his support for striking RMT members, but because he gave interviews in which he contradicted party policy. (See 1.11pm.)\n\n\n\n\n 2.00pm  \nSenior Aslef official resigns from Labour party following sacking of Sam Tarry\n\nKevin Lindsay, Scottish organiser for the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, has announced that he has resigned from the Labour party following the sacking yesterday of Sam Tarry. Lindsay also says he will now be backing calls for the union to disaffiliate from Labour. In his resignation letter to the party he said:\n\nThe Labour party was and is meant to be the political wing of the trade union movement but now it\u2019s more interested in trying woo Tory voters in the shires of England than representing working people.\nAs a democrat, I respect that Keir Starmer has been elected the leader but I truly believe his performance and policies are making it impossible for the Labour party to return to power and that he should be removed from his position immediately. There needs to be a change in leadership and political direction but I sadly can\u2019t see this happening and we will end up with PM Truss for several years.\nTherefore I have made the decision not only to resign from the Labour party but now also support the proposal for Aslef to disaffiliate from the party.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.36pm BST\n\n\n 1.35pm  \nStarmer says Truss's plans to limit ability of unions to call strikes 'completely wrong'\n\nAnd here are some more lines from what Keir Starmer said to reporters during his Birmingham visit when asked about his approach to trade unions and strikes.\n\nStarmer said he would take \u201ceach case as it comes\u201d when deciding whether to allow frontbenchers to join picket lines. In the past shadow ministers have been told not to appear on picket lines. Asked if they could support RMT pickets during the strike on Saturday, provided they did not give unauthorised interviews, Starmer replied: \u201cWe take each case as it comes. I want to see these issues resolved.\u201d He also said the role of a \u201cresponsible government\u201d was to get the key players around the table to resolve the issues.\n\n\nHe said that Liz Truss was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d in wanting to further curtail the ability of trade unions to hold strikes. Asked about her plans, he said:\n\n\nI think she\u2019s completely wrong about that. What we need to do is to improve the rights of working people. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve drafted a whole set of employment rights from day one for working people.\n\n\nHe refused to say whether he would back calls for a general strike if Truss tried to implement her plans. But he said unions were right to stick up for their members. Asked about the prospect of some sort of coordinated strike action (see 9.58am), and whether he would approve, he said:\n\n\nIt\u2019s quite right for trade unions to stick up for their members and to fight for their members. Of course, it is. And it\u2019s their members who are really struggling under this cost-of-living crisis.\nSo, of course, trade unions are right to stick up for support and negotiate on behalf of their members. I\u2019m fully supportive of that, working with our trade unions.\n\n\nHe said the trade unions would \u201calways\u201d be part of the labour movement.\n\n\nHe said he expected the Unite union to continue to have a relationship with the Labour party. Unite is Labour\u2019s biggest donor and its general secretary, Sharon Graham, has been particularly critical of the decision to sack Sam Tarry. She posted these messages on Twitter yesterday.\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he was worried about Unite withdrawing funding from the party, Starmer said:\n\nThe Unite union and the Labour party have a very strong relationship.\nI am a member of the Unite union. That relationship is historic, it is present, and it will be the future of the Labour party.\nThey work with us on our employment rights\u2019 draft legislation, which is, you know, the most comprehensive set of employment rights that we have ever seen coming out of the Labour party.\n\n\n\n\n 1.11pm  \nStarmer says Sam Tarry sacked as shadow transport minister because he 'made up policy on the hoof'\n\nKeir Starmer has said Sam Tarry was sacked as shadow transport minister because he \u201cmade up policy on the hoof\u201d. Speaking on a visit to Birmingham, Starmer said:\n\nSam Tarry was sacked because he booked himself onto media programmes without permission, and then made up policy on the hoof, and that can\u2019t be tolerated in any organisation because we\u2019ve got collective responsibility. So that was relatively straightforward.\nOf course, as far as the industrial action is concerned, I completely understand the frustration of so many working people who\u2019ve seen the prices go up, seen inflation through the roof, and their wages haven\u2019t gone up.\nSo the Labour party will always be on the side of working people, but we need collective responsibility, as any organisation does.\n\nStarmer was referring in particular to an interview Tarry gave yesterday in which he said people like rail workers should not get below-inflation pay rises. That is not party policy.\n\nUpdated at 4.40pm BST\n\n\n 1.00pm  \nJohnson mocks Sunak over his VAT on fuel U-turn in rare public intervention in Tory leadership contest\n\nBoris Johnson has mocked Rishi Sunak, his former chancellor, for announcing a U-turn this week and proposing to scrap VAT on fuel bills for a year.\nIn a speech at the Commonwealth Business Forum in Birmingham, the outgoing prime minister acknowledged that he was leaving office sooner than he wanted. He told his audience:\n\nWe come now to the next stage in the great relay race of politics.\nI didn\u2019t think it was meant to be a relay race, by the way, when I started.\nI can assure you that the baton is going to be passed seamlessly and invisibly to the hand of somebody else.\nI\u2019ll give you this assurance, they will continue with the same programme, cutting taxes, simplifying regulation as much as possible, taking advantage of all our new regulatory freedoms, getting rid of every encumbrance from solvency to MiFID to VAT on fuel - turns out to be easier than we thought.\n\nJohnson has said almost nothing in public about the candidates vying to succeed him - even though it is an open secret that he favours Liz Truss. He feels betrayed by Sunak, whose resignation as chancellor precipitated a flood of resignations by ministers and ministerial aides that led to Johnson realising they would have to quit.\nWhen Sunak was still at the Treasury, some in No 10 felt he was unreasonably blocking measures that would help people with the cost of living. During the 2016 referendum Johnson said the government would abolish VAT on fuel bills after the UK left the EU, but Sunak blocked proposals to do that earlier this year, arguing that it was better to target help for the poor than implement a tax cut that would be particularly helpful to wealthy people heating large houses.\nSunak announced his U-turn on Tuesday night. He said had had changed his mind in the light of evidence that the energy price cap is now expected to rise above \u00a33,000 in October, but the announcement was also interpreted as a panic move from a candidate who fears he is losing.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.48pm BST\n\n\n 12.34pm  \n\nIn her interview on the Today programme this morning Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, appeared to play down the impact of the huge rise in fuel costs that people are going to face this winter. When it was put to her that bills would be going up by \u00a32,300 this autum, Dorries replied: \u201cSome, some people\u2019s bills may increase by that amount.\u201d The italics illustrate the words she was stressing. Dorries highlighted measures already taken by the government to help people with their bills.\nThe presenter, Martha Kearney, was quoting a figure provided by Martin Lewis, the money saving expert, in an interview on the programme earlier. As the Manchester Evening News reports, Lewis said:\n\nLet\u2019s be absolutely plain here, we know roughly what the price cap is going to be. It is set based on a published algorithm - it is based on wholesale prices. The October price cap is based on prices between February and mid-August so we\u2019re nearly at the end of that.\nAnd the current prediction is prices will rise 77% on top of the 52% rise we saw in April, taking the typical bill to \u00a33,500 a year, that\u2019s with the prediction I go for. Others are saying it will go higher we\u2019re expecting it to rise again in January.\nNow what that means year on year from last October to this October, a typical house will be paying \u00a32,300 a year more on their energy bills alone.\n\nThese are from the consumer journalist Harry Wallop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.14pm  \n\nRobert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies, a rightwing thinktank, and one of the authors of the 2019 Conservative manifesto, is in despair at Rishi Sunak\u2019s green belt policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.02pm BST\n\n\n 12.06pm  \nSunak says as PM he would tighten planning rules to further restrict building on green belt\n\nRishi Sunak, the former chancellor and Tory leadership candidate, has announced that he would tighten planning rules to further restrict building on the green belt if he be became prime minister. He would also stop local authorities removing land from the green belt.\nCiting an interview that Liz Truss, his rival, gave in 2019, in which she said 1m homes should be built on the London green belt, Sunak also claimed that this was now a policy area where the difference between the two candidates was \u201chuge\u201d.\nUnder planning rules for England, development can be allowed on the green belt in \u201cvery special circumstances\u201d. Sunak says that if a local community judged such development inappropriate, he would not allow that decision to be overruled in any circumstances.\nHe says he would block the \u201cloophole\u201d that allows councils to take some land out of the green belt so that it can be freed up for development. As a result, the green belt has shrunk by 1%, he says.\nBut he also says he would change planning rules to make building on brownfield sites easier. \nIn a statement he says:\n\nGreen belt land is extremely precious in the UK. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen too many examples of local councils circumventing the views of residents by taking land out of the green belt for development, but I will put a stop to it.\nUnder my plans, if a local community has clearly judged a development to be inappropriate there are no circumstances in which planning permission should be granted. \nMore homes can be built while protecting the green belt and our most precious landscapes. Data shows that well over a million homes could be built across the country on brownfield sites with particularly high capacity in the north-west, Yorkshire and the West Midlands. \nThese places are crying out for new homes and a combination of building here and more inner-city densification will help us provide the housing that the UK needs, whilst protecting the countryside around our towns and cities.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.21pm BST\n\n\n 11.32am  \nDrug deaths in Scotland fall for first time since 2013, but still at 'unacceptable' levels, Scottish government says\n\nDrug-related deaths in Scotland fell by nine in 2021, according to the latest figures released by National Records of Scotland, the first decrease since 2013 but falling well short of the significant reduction that campaigners are calling for.\nThe latest figure of 1,330 is still the second highest annual total on record, and Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe and five times the rate in England.\nThe figures reveal a number of local rises in Edinburgh from 92 to 109 and Dumfries and Galloway from 22 to 35 and Glasgow 291 to 311, while deaths of women increased by 8% to 397.\nResponding to the figures, the SNP MP Stewart McDonald said the figures were still \u201ceye-watering\u201d.\n\nAngela Constance, the Scottish government\u2019s minister for drugs policy, a dedicated position created by Nicola Sturgeon in December 2020 after the first minster admitted her government had \u201ctaken its eye off the ball\u201d, said the number of deaths remained \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that work would continue \u201cat pace\u201d to address the public health emergency.\nBut other campaigners pointed to a \u201cmassive accountability gap\u201d around quality and availability of services.\nJustina Murray, CEO of Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs said she was calling for a target of zero drug deaths, saying anything less was an \u201cinsult\u201d. She said:\n\nWe\u2019ve had a raft of reports, policies and strategies that say what needs to change, and families are more likely to be included round the table, but it\u2019s much harder to track their influence on the ground. We don\u2019t understand what\u2019s getting in the way of good words becoming good deeds.\n\nLast week, Scotland\u2019s drugs deaths taskforce published a hard-hitting report condemning \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d underfunding of services.\nThe Scottish Labour MSP Paul Sweeney, who has launched member\u2019s bill to establish overdose prevention centres, where addicts can take drugs with support and supervision, said: \n\n1,330 of our fellow Scots have died entirely preventable deaths and we should not be celebrating this as an achievement ... The solutions are no secret. We need action, not reports with recommendations that are never implemented.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.43pm BST\n\n\n 11.21am  \nLabour ministers did join picket lines in 1970s, says McDonnell, accusing Starmer of 'complete misreading' of public mood\n\nOn Tuesday, explaining his decision to order Labour frontbenchers not to join RMT picket lines, Keir Starmer said: \u201cThe Labour party in opposition needs to be the Labour party in power. And a government doesn\u2019t go on picket lines, a government tries to resolve disputes.\u201d\nBut in the late 1970s, when Labour was in government, government ministers did join picket lines, at the Grunwick dispute, John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, writes in an article for the Guardian. He says:\n\nI went with our CLP delegation regularly. It was a tough and, at times, violent dispute as the police escorted a bus full of scabs brought in by the company to break the strike and teach the women a lesson.\nThe Labour and trade union movement came together as one to campaign against the exploitation of these women. Joining the picket lines to show solidarity were some of the most prominent members of the movement, and among those who joined the women\u2019s picket line were Labour cabinet ministers. Not shadow ministers but cabinet ministers actually serving in government at the time, including, famously, Shirley Williams.\n\nMcDonnell says Starmer\u2019s decision to ban frontbencher from joining picket lines is \u201ca complete misreading of the mood within the Labour and trade union movement but also among the general public\u201d. He says:\n\nIn terms of the general public, the reason that there is an unprecedented level of sympathy for these strikes is not just down to the impressive straight-talking eloquence of the RMT\u2019s Mick Lynch. It\u2019s because millions are being hit by the same cost of living crisis, which has become the key mobilising factor in the massive wave of industrial disputes that is currently building.\nThe risk is that when the millions involved go to the polls next, they will be asking the question of the Labour leader, where were you when we needed you? Whatever diktats from the Labour leader\u2019s office, there is a weightier responsibility on the shoulders of Labour members, whatever position they hold. It is to stand up for one another in the Labour and trade union movement in this summer of solidarity.\n\nYou can read the full McDonnell article here.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.22am BST\n\n\n 10.56am  \nTruss suggests she might reconsider government plan to privatise Channel 4\n\nAnd here are some more lines from what Liz Truss has been saying to reporters on her visit in Leeds.\n\nTruss hinted that she might reconsider government plans to privatise Channel 4. Asked if she would go ahead with the privatisation as PM, she replied:\n\n\nI believe that, where possible, it\u2019s best to have companies operating in the private sector rather than the public sector.\nI will look in detail at the business case on Channel 4, but one thing I\u2019m absolutely committed to is it staying in Leeds.\n\nRishi Sunak, Truss\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership, has said he would definitely go ahead with the privatisation.\n\nShe said she would not commit to restoring plans for HS2 to go to Leeds. She said:\n\n\nWhat I\u2019m committing to today is Northern Powerhouse Rail. I grew up in Leeds, I know how poor the local transport is. What people need is good routes to commute into work. That is where there is a real issue for people getting into work around West Yorkshire ...\nI\u2019m not going to commit to restoring that leg of HS2 [to Leeds].\n\n\nShe said it was \u201cnot time for another windfall tax\u201d on energy companies to help with energy bills.\n\n\nShe defended her plans to curb the ability of unions to hold strikes, saying she would \u201cput through legislation making sure that essential services are provided on our railways\u201d.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.57am BST\n\n\n 10.39am  \nTruss rejects thinktank report saying Foreign Office under her leadership lacks expertise in Russia\n\nLiz Truss, the foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has rejected claims that the Foreign Office under her leadership lacked expertise in Russia.\nThe claim is made in a report into how the Foreign Office operates published by the Institute for Government thinktank. My colleague Patrick Wintour has written it up here.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on a trip to Leeds, Truss said the claim that the Foreign Office was short of experts on Russia was \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d. She went on:\n\nWe have led the world in standing up to Russia. We were the first country to send weapons to Ukraine in Europe, we put the toughest sanctions on Russia of any country, and we\u2019re also making sure that nobody is allowing Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territory to be given up, and we\u2019ve worked with our allies to achieve that.\nI\u2019m proud of our record, but we need to do more, and one of the key areas in bringing down the cost of living is dealing with Russia - making sure they can\u2019t hold the world to ransom over their gas supplies - and I will be tough in standing up to Putin.\n\nHere is an extract from the report explaining why the IfG thinks Russia has been neglected by the Foreign Office. This is just one of several areas where the IfG thinks the department\u2019s performance could improve.\n\nThe Institute has argued that the war in Ukraine requires the UK, and democratic nations more generally, to review its approach to Russia. But this is hindered by the relatively small team dedicated to it. This is not new; as many interviewees for this paper noted, and observers have commented publicly, after the Cold War there was a \u2018moment of hope\u2019 and a belief that the worst of the Russian threat had passed. Diplomatic expertise on the countries of the former Soviet Union was reduced. Ambitious members of the Foreign Office specialised in other fields, such as the Middle East and China. This decline in expertise on Russia and its neighbours was noted in 2014 after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea by Sir Nigel Sheinwald, former UK ambassador to Moscow, who said: \u201cWhen the [Crimea] crisis happened, there was a problem in the Foreign Office; the old Cold War cadre of people just wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\nBy 2016 the comparative lack of resources dedicated to Russia was well-established. Between 2016 and 2022, the Eastern Europe and Central Asia unit was consistently among the worst resourced of the geographical units in the FCO and then FCDO. The number of UKB staff at the embassy in Moscow has also been slowly reduced; exact numbers are not available for recent years, but staff numbers fell from 30 in 2016/17 to somewhere in the 20s in 2020/21.\nOther elements of the Foreign Office\u2019s Russian expertise have continued to be downgraded. Despite the Foreign Affairs Committee drawing attention to Russian language proficiency as a \u2018weak spot\u2019 in 2015, the number of staff in the department who could speak it at \u2018advanced\u2019 level dropped from 83 in December 2017 to below 60 in February 2022.\n\n\n\n\n 10.18am  \nMore than 100,000 people fleeing war in Ukraine have arrived in UK under visa schemes, Home Office says\n\nMore than 100,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine have received sanctuary in the UK through its visa schemes, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nSome 104,000 people had arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes as of Monday, figures published by the Home Office and UK Visas and Immigration show.\nThis includes 31,300 people under the family scheme, and 72,700 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme.\nThe figures also show that, as of Tuesday, around 198,200 applications have been made for visas, and 166,200 visas have been issued.\nThese include 55,000 applications under the family scheme, of which 47,200 visas have been granted, and 143,200 applications under the sponsorship scheme, of which 119,000 visas have been granted.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.19am BST\n\n\n 10.13am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.58am  \nCoordinated strike action by trade unions 'inevitable', says John McDonnell\n\nYesterday Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretry, suggested that if Liz Truss becomes prime minister, and tries to implement her plans to restrict the ability of trade unions to call strikes, the union movement should respond with a 1926-style general strike.\n\nIn his interview on Sky News this morning, John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, was asked if he would support a general strike. He suggested he would, saying it was sensible for unions to coordinate action. He said:\n\nIf you look at the ballots that are taking place across the trade union movement, we are talking about millions of workers now voting for industrial action. So, naturally, what people are saying as well, why not coordinate that?\nI support co-ordinated action, because if that results in a decent pay rise for people, they are protected against the cost-of-living crisis. I think that\u2019s the most effective thing to do.\n\nMcDonnell said the strikes would not be necessary if workers were paid properly. But, because the government was not listening, coordinated strike action was \u201cinevitable\u201d, he claimed. He said:\n\nBut, you know, this is completely unnecessary. What it needs is the government to recognise that you can\u2019t expect people to stand on one side when their wages are being cut ...\nYou can understand why unions are saying that if we are going to strike, we might as well coordinate that action. So coordinated action, I think, is going to be inevitable, and I just hope that the government starts listening.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.24am  \n\nNadine Dorries has suggested in another interview this morning that Rishi Sunak was part of a \u201ccoup\u201d that brought down Boris Johnson, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports.\n\n\n\n\n 9.19am  \nJohnson wants supporters to halt bid to get Tory party to give members vote on letting him stay, Dorries claims\n\nBoris Johnson wants his supporters to abandon their campaign to get Conservative HQ to give party members a vote on whether he should be allowed to stay on as leader.\nIt is claimed that more than 10,000 members have signed a petition saying. members should get a vote on whether or not Johnson has resigned. But so far the party has not taken any notice, and CCHQ believes some of the people who have signed are not genuine members anyway.\nIn an interview with the Today programme Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, who is close to Johnson, said she had recently discussed this with the prime minister. Johnson told her, \u201cTell them to stop, it\u2019s not right,\u201d she said. Dorries went on: \u201cThey were his words, his exact words.\u201d\nShe also claimed that a report in the Daily Mirror suggesting that she might vacate her Mid Bedfordshire seat, where she has a majority of almost 25,000, to make way for Johnson was \u201c100% nuclear grade tosh\u201d.\nThe Mirror says that the idea had been discussed because Johnson wants to stay in the Commons, and hopes that he may get a chance to lead the Tories again, but feels he needs a safe seat. Currently he represents Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he had a majority of 7,210 at the last election but where a big swing to Labour could see him lose.\nIn her Mirror story Pippa Crerar writes:\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s personal appeal with Tory voters in his West London seat, a popular local Conservative council and strong grassroots campaigners should, in theory, make ousting the top Tory a difficult task.\nHowever, modelling earlier this month from Britain Elects predicted that Labour could get 43.7% of the vote in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, an increase of 6.1% on 2019, if there was an election held today. Mr Johnson\u2019s vote share would drop by 11.5%, giving him just 41.1% of the vote.\nLabour and Lib Dem voters have shown themselves willing to vote tactically in recent by-elections while constituency boundary changes would add Northolt, regarded as a Labour area, to the seat.\nYoung professional graduates who are more likely to vote against the Tories have been moving in droves out of central London to suburbs like Hillingdon.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.21am BST\n\n\n 8.58am  \nLabour left accuses Keir Starmer of double standards over Sam Tarry sacking\n\nGood morning. Tonight Liz Truss will compete with Rishi Sunak at the first of the official hustings being organised by the Conservative party for members. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary and Truss supporter, has been on the broadcast round this morning and, despite reportedly being told by Truss\u2019s team to tone down her comments about Sunak, she has found it hard to resist, and her interviews have included various studs up attacks on the former chancellor. On LBC she accused him of \u201cmansplaining\u201d in the BBC debate on Monday, and said it was a \u201cterrrible look\u201d. And on BBC Breadkfast she defended her decision to have a go at him over his expensive clothes, saying \u201cit\u2019s about judgment, and it\u2019s about who voters can relate to\u201d.\nBut the Labour party is going through a bout of internal fighting too, triggered by Keir Starmer\u2019s decision last night to sack Sam Tarry as shadow transport minister after he joined an RMT picket line (defying orders from Starmer) and then proceeded to give a series of interviews that had not been authorised by the leadership and in which he flatly contradicted party policy on public sector pay (the real reason why he was sacked, Labour says). My colleague Jessica Elgot has all the details here.\n\nAs Jess reports, union leaders have criticised Starmer\u2019s move, arguing that it shows Labour is not committed to standing up for working people. This morning leftwingers in the parliamentary party have also accused Starmer of double standards, saying that Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, also gave an interview this week in which she departed form party policy, but that she was not sacked. Reeves said Labour was opposed to rail renationalisation, but later the party said that remained its policy.\nJohn McDonnell, shadow chancellor when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, told Sky News:\n\nRachel Reeves went on an interview and made up policy on rail nationalisation which had to be contradicted by the shadow spokesperson on transport within hours. I didn\u2019t see Rachel Reeves being sacked. \n\nDiane Abbott, shadow home secretary under Corbyn, made the same argument in an interview on the Today programme.\nMcDonnell also told Sky News that Starmer had generated a \u201ccompletely unnecessary row\u201d. He said:\n\nJust at a time when the Tories are tearing themselves apart, and we\u2019ve got the maximum opportunity, I think, to gain an advantage in the polls that will build the support to take us into a government, we\u2019re having this completely unnecessary row.\nSam went on the picket lines like shadow minister after shadow minister over the years in support of workers who are asking for a decent pay rise. It\u2019s a just cause ...\nThe Tory leadership election is demonstrating how the Tories are ripping themselves apart. This is the time where we should have maximum unity and maximum solidarity for the support for workers who are desperate to have a decent pay rise because they\u2019ve been impacted upon so badly by this cost of living crisis.\n\nThe Tory hustings does not start until 7pm this evening. There is not a lot in the diary until then, although Starmer is on a visit in Birmingham, and Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, is doing a phone-in on LBC at 10am.\nI try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.\nIf you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow.\nAlternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com\n\n\nUpdated at 11.17am BST\n"

That\u2019s the reality. We haven\u2019t brought any new players in, bar one late on, in the last two windows, and that\u2019s a replacement.\u201d This isn\u2019t going to end well, is it.\n\n\n\n\n 10.54pm  \n\nDuje \u0106aleta-Car has passed his medical with Southampton.

Some top-quality admin required, right here, right now.\n\n\n\n\n 10.45pm  \n\nJames Garner isn\u2019t the only Manchester United midfielder to leave the club this evening. Jamie Jackson reports that Tahith Chong has joined Birmingham City on a permanent transfer.\n\n\n\n 10.43pm  \n\nThere\u2019s always one deadline-day fiasco. Bamba Dieng, who decided to turn down Leeds at the last minute in favour of Nice, has reportedly failed his medical at the French club.\n\n\n\n\n 10.40pm  \n\nDan James has passed his medical at Fulham, while Billy Gilmour has done the same at Brighton. Expect both moves to go through now, though no official announcements have been made yet.\n\n\n\n 10.37pm  \n\nEverton have signed a second midfielder today with James Garner completing his move from Manchester United. The 21-year-old who spent last season on loan at Nottingham Forest, has cost an initial \u00a39m with \u00a36.5m payable in add-ons. United are also entitled to 20% of the profit on any future sale. Garner has signed a four year contract and is eligible to make his debut against Liverpool on Saturday.\n\n\n\n 10.36pm  \n\nBad news for Arsenal fans: I understand there\u2019ll be no deal for Douglas Luiz tonight. Arsenal tried hard all day and made three bids, the final last-ditch attempt totalling \u00a325m, but Aston Villa were not for turning and Mikel Arteta will have to go with what he\u2019s got.\n\n\n\n 10.35pm  \n\nTurns out Liverpool may have an option to buy Arthur Melo after all. Juventus have released a statement laying out terms of the agreement, which includes a \u20ac4.5m loan fee, and the option to \u201cdefinitively acquire the player\u2019s registration rights\u201d for a further \u20ac37.5m.\n\nUpdated at 10.40pm BST\n\n\n 10.30pm  \n\n\nThe Guardian is funded by readers like you.

Brendan Rodgers, interviewed after his significantly weakened squad\u2019s latest defeat, against Manchester United this evening, has launched a shot across the board\u2019s bows. \u201cWith the greatest respect, we have not had the help in the transfer market that this team has needed,\u201d he told BT Sport. This sort of thing didn\u2019t do Scotty Parker much good, so it\u2019ll be worth keeping an eye on events at the King Power over the next few days, weeks and months. Do we give it weeks and months?\n\n\n\n 10.20pm  \nJames Garner joins Everton\n\nAs expected, James Garner has made the move from Old Trafford to Goodison Park. The fee is undisclosed, but rumoured to be \u00a315m once add-ons are factored in. It\u2019s a permanent four-year deal.\n\n\n\n\n 10.16pm  \nJuan Larios signs for Southampton\n\nThe path from the Etihad to St Mary\u2019s is becoming very well trodden this summer. Manchester City\u2019s 18-year-old defender Juan Larios is the latest to make the journey south to Southampton. Jamie Jackson reports that he joins for \u00a36m with, again, buy-back and sell-on clauses part of the deal. Gavin Bazunu, Romeo Lavia and Samuel Edozie prepare to welcome their old pal with open arms.\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm BST\n\n\n 10.13pm  \n\nMemphis Depay has decided to stay at Barcelona.

Melo joins on a season-long loan from Juve, and Liverpool will stump up the majority of his wages.

Manchester United\u2019s resurgence under Erik ten Hag continues apace, as they make it three wins on the bounce for the first time since April 2021.

Now they\u2019ve landed the versatile Ainsley Maitland-Niles on a season-long loan from Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n 9.00pm  \n\nThe less-travelled road from Rome to Oxford. Djavan Anderson was on the Lazio bench for their Serie A game against Sampdoria last night. Today he\u2019s signed permanently for Oxford. \u201cIt\u2019s always been my biggest dream to play in England,\u201d the 27-year-old Dutch right back told the Oxford Mail. \u201cI\u2019m really a \u2018feeling\u2019 type of guy, if I feel something and it feels right then I know. I spoke with the owner and the head coach, we had a good chat and it felt like home. I didn\u2019t even see the facilities or the city but as soon as I arrived I knew I made the right decision.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.54pm  \n\nJames Garner is off to Everton. He\u2019s reportedly signed on the dotted line at Goodison, with Manchester United pocketing an initial \u00a39m that will rise to \u00a315m with add-ons, and there\u2019s no buyback clause. All together now, kids of the 70s \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 8.46pm  \n\nHaving packed Leander Dendoncker off to Aston Villa, Wolves have a gap in their midfield roster. They\u2019re hoping to fill it this evening with Boubacar Traore, and Sky have just reported that a loan deal for the 21-year-old Malian has been struck with Metz. Wolves have also secured an \u00a311m option to buy.\n\n\n\n 8.42pm  \n\nRangers meanwhile are hoping the window will shut without any further movement. That\u2019s because Nice and Reims are sniffing around Glen Kamara. Some better news: the Ibrox club will trouser 15 percent of the \u00a310m fee Brighton are paying Chelsea for their old boy Billy Gilmour.\n\n\n\n 8.38pm  \n\nCeltic are reportedly preparing to announce one in, one out.

Looks like Liverpool will be bolstering their injury-decimated midfield after all.\n\n\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\nAnother Chelsea player heads for the exit door, albeit on a career-developing loan. The 18-year-old midfield prospect Harvey Vale has signed a new four-year deal with the Stamford Bridge club, before hot-footing it up to Hull, where he\u2019ll play his football this season.\n\n\n\n 8.06pm  \nLeander Dendoncker joins Aston Villa\n\nThe 27-year-old Belgium international swaps Molineux for Villa Park.

Fulham\u2019s efforts to sign Blackburn Rovers striker Ben Brereton Diaz have come to nought, so they\u2019re doubling down on their bid to prise Carlos Vin\u00edcius from Benfica. Vin\u00edcius is currently on loan at PSV, so if that\u2019s cut short there\u2019s a knock-on effect: anyone interested in Cody Gakpo \u2013 Leeds, Southampton, Manchester United \u2013 can pretty much forget about it.\n\n\n\n 7.33pm  \n\nWesley Fofana\u2019s transfer from Leicester to Chelsea: the story that keeps on giving. Brendan Rodgers has responded to that Instagram statement in his pre-match interview with BT Sport. \u201cWe\u2019d hoped he\u2019d stay on at least another year \u2026 he\u2019s a good guy and I know probably other influences have taken him away from the club.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n 7.25pm  \n\nForgotten Men of Chelsea dept. Ethan Ampadu has agreed to move to Spezia on loan for the season, while Nottingham Forest are in for Michy Batshuayi.\n\n\n\n 7.19pm  \n\nA reminder of today\u2019s big deals so far.\n\nAntony (Ajax to Manchester United, \u00a382m)\nManuel Akanki (Dortmund to Manchester City, \u00a316.7m)\nWout Faes (Reims to Leicester City, \u00a315m)\nIdrissa Gana Gueye (PSG to Everton, \u00a32m)\nWilly Boly (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, \u00a34.65m)\nWillian (to Fulham, free agent)\nMartin Dubravka (Newcastle to Manchester United, loan)\nLayvin Kurzawa (PSG to Fulham, loan)\nJack Stephens (Southampton to Bournemouth, loan)\n\n\u201cHas everyone had Woly Boly by the Butthole Surfers going through their head this transfer deadline day, or is it just me?\u201d asks Brian Sharon. \u201cI look forward to hearing Forest fans belting this out on the terraces.\u201d It\u2019d be a departure from Mull of Kintyre all right.\n\n\n\n 7.11pm  \n\nManchester United had been linked with Barcelona full-back Sergino Dest. However the 21-year-old USA international has opted to join AC Milan on loan. The Rossoneri have a \u20ac20m option to buy come the end of the season.\n\n\n\n 7.06pm  \n\nFans of actual football are reminded that there\u2019s some hot Premier League action coming up tonight. Rob Smyth has all the details of Manchester United\u2019s trip to current Crisis Baton\u2122 holders Leicester City here. But hey, we can squeeze some transfer-related stuff out of this if we really try hard enough. And look who\u2019s getting off the coach outside the King Power! Yep, he\u2019s turned up for work, has been named on the bench, and that surely puts any chance of his leaving the club in this window to bed. Great news for United!\n\n\n\n\n 6.57pm  \n\nChelsea\u2019s extravagant summer spree continues right up until the last minute. They\u2019ve secured the services of Juventus defensive midfielder Denis Zakaria on loan. Here Fabrizio Romano goes!\n\n\n\n\n 6.51pm  \n\nPaulo Gazzaniga\u2019s days at Fulham looked numbered after the arrival of Bernd Leno, and so it has proved. He\u2019s off to Girona on loan. Look!\n\n\n\n\n 6.41pm  \n\nSome potentially annoying news for Leeds United. It looked like they\u2019d landed Bamba Dieng, but it appears the Marseille forward is off to Nice instead. He was preparing to take a flight to Leeds Bradford Airport when Nice\u2019s bid for a one-year loan came through. The pilot was told to cool his boots, and Dieng went back to the terminal to think it through. Now all signs point to his staying in Ligue 1.\n\n\n\n 6.37pm  \n\n[Exhales slowly, and at length, through the nose. Rubs temples. Snaps out of it.]\nRight, it\u2019s going to be a long night. The transfer window shuts in less than four-and-a-half hours. All aboard the rollercoaster! Let\u2019s go!\n\n\n\n 6.31pm  \n\nBilly Gilmour is closing in on that \u00a310m permanent deal to Brighton. What a good move for the Scot that is \u2013 he\u2019s miles from the first team at Chelsea and after a disastrous loan spell at Norwich, you would not have been surprised to see him in the Championship before too long. Loads of talent in there though, the 2022 Joshua McEachran. \nThat\u2019s my little stint done on the blog, I\u2019m going to hand over to Scott Murray, who will take you through to the close in a few hours. \u2018Enjoy\u2019 it. Cheers! \n\n\n\n 6.23pm  \n\nJulian Draxler has joined Benfica on loan from PSG. One of my favourite players to watch and terrifyingly silky when he\u2019s on form. The thing is, he hasn\u2019t been on form for a while now. Amazingly, though, he\u2019s still just 28 years old. Feels like he\u2019s been around for decades. \n\n\n\n 6.17pm  \n\nNottingham Forest are at it again. They could complete two more signings in the coming hours, with Rennes defender Lo\u00efc Bad\u00e9 and Blackpool\u2019s Josh Bowler (think Jarrod Bowen lite) both mooted for deals. \nBowler is a tricky left-footed winger that plays off the right that could apparently end up going immediately off to Olympiacos on loan, just as Hwang Ui-jo did last week. It would be a very odd deal, but with could sort all parties. Bowler is in the final year of his contract to Blackpool are minded to cash in now, Nottingham Forest are getting a promising young player for good value (reportedly \u00a34m) and on sensible wages, and while Bowler gets to play in the Europa League this season and earn more money than he\u2019s on at the moment. Steve Cooper has been a fan of Bowler for a while, and tried to buy him in January. I suspect Forest see him as one for the future and maybe even a player that would excel next season in the Championship if Forest aren\u2019t able to stay up. Anyway, a long way to go before all.\n\n\n\n 5.59pm  \n\n\nThe Guardian is funded by readers like you.

The midfielder made famous by that screamer against Manchester United joins on a quite remarkable loan that runs to January. \n\n\n\n\n 5.53pm  \n\nSpeaking of goalkeepers, Jamie Jackson has been in touch with more details of the Martin Dubravka loan to Manchester United. Newcastle are owed \u00a32m, plus a \u00a36m obligation to buy if he starts a certain number of Premier League games.\n\n\n\n 5.50pm  \n\nDown the coast from Almer\u00eda, Girona have signed Paulo Gazzaniga from Fulham. The former Southampton and Tottenham keeper joins on a season-long loan which will take him to the end of his Fulham contract \u2013 the 30-year-old has been moved down the pecking order since the arrival of Bernd Leno from Arsenal earlier in the summer. \n\n\n\n 5.46pm  \n\nAnyway back to the football. A rather big deal that has just been completed is Real Sociedad\u2019s move for Sadiq Umar from Almer\u00eda, which is reportedly around \u20ac20m + \u20ac6m in add-ons. The pacy striker scored 19 goals in the Spanish second tier to help Almer\u00eda to promotion and has bagged two in three in La Liga this season.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.46pm BST\n\n\n 5.35pm  \n\nEvening all.

The 32-year-old has signed a two-year contract and becomes Everton\u2019s seventh summer signing.\nGueye, who joined PSG for \u00a330m in 2019 after three productive seasons at Goodison Park, agreed a return to Merseyside several weeks ago only for the terms of his release from the French champions, where the midfielder had 12 months remaining on his contract, to delay the deal.\nThe Senegal international is eligible for Saturday\u2019s Merseyside derby at home to Liverpool and is expected to be joined by fellow midfielder James Garner, with a deal rising to \u00a315m agreed with Manchester United. Everton are also exploring several forward options ahead of the deadline.\nGana Gueye said: \u201cI\u2019ll give my soul to this team. Coming back here was important to me because I feel like I\u2019m in my home. I\u2019ve followed the team every week and watched how they play. For me, there is no better place than Everton, so that\u2019s why I chose to come back here.\n\u201cI felt very, very good when I was here (the first time) and even when I went to Paris, I kept in touch with some of the players here and continued to support the team. For me, it\u2019s special. I told PSG if I am going to leave it will be for one team \u2014 and that was Everton. It was not a difficult decision for me because I love this club. That\u2019s why I had to come home.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 6.05pm BST\n\n\n 4.40pm  \n\nCheck out our comprehensive list of all the transfers from the big five European leagues.\n\n\n\n\n 4.32pm  \n\nFulham sign Layvin Kurzawa on loan from PSG\nKurzawa, a left-back who has played 13 times for France, has moved to Craven Cottage on a season-long loan.

In the circumstances, I think that\u2019s a really smart move. I never really understood why Arthur\u2019s career started to drift as he looked a player at Barcelona.\n\n\n\n 4.00pm  \n\n\u201cWith respect to Chris Amirault\u2019s comment on Aubameyang, perhaps he wasn\u2019t at Barcelona long enough for things to turn sour,\u201d says Chris Hennessy. \u201cPeople forget that he was run out of Dortmund for disciplinary reasons, which is why the end at Arsenal should not really come as a surprise.\u201d\nAre we saying he\u2019s the on-field equivalent of Jose Mourinho? He\u2019s 33, so I suppose there isn\u2019t much danger of fourth-season syndrome at Chelsea. \n\n\n\n 3.58pm  \n\n\u201cTo add to the discussion of contrived deadline-day poses,\u201d begins David Hopkins, \u201cwhatever happened to the halcyon days of players from Europe being pictured \u2018enjoying\u2019 whatever passed for their national cuisine in the provincial town they\u2019d found themselves in?

Sevilla have signed Kasper Dolberg on loan from Nice, with a \u20ac20m purchase option, while Martin Braithwaite has left Barcelona and is expected to join neighbours Espanyol.\nLigue 1 high-flyers Lens have sold striker Ignatius Ganago to Nantes, and signed midfielder Jean Onana from Bordeaux. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach have brought Julian Weigl back to Germany on loan from Benfica, with striker Krzysztof Piatek leaving Hertha Berlin for Salernitana. Marko Pjaca, who was surplus to requirements at Juventus, has joined Empoli on loan with a reported \u20ac1m buy option.\n\n\n\n 3.48pm  \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like some sort of Frankenstein\u2019s Monster mash-up of Jerry Seinfeld and Abraham Simpson but what is the deal with the modern-day footballer and their contrived \u2018I\u2019ve just been signed\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m starting today\u2019s match\u2019 poses?\u201d says Graeme Neil. \u201cIn my day, you didn\u2019t even get that with David Ginola...\u201d\nAnd nobody brings a squash racket any more.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.27pm BST\n\n\n 3.43pm  \n\n\u201cI wanted to confirm your comment about Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at Barca,\u201d says Chris Amirault. \u201cWhat has been most striking is, oddly enough, his attitude, which was certainly in question at Arsenal. It wasn\u2019t just scoring: he brought a real joy to the team on the pitch at a time when it was desperately needed. It was hard to believe that this was the same person Arteta dumped.\u201d\nHe\u2019d been at Arsenal for four years, and for most of that time he was outstanding. Sometimes people just need a change; there\u2019s no more or less to it than that.\n\n\n\n 3.41pm  \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think the whole Martin Braithwaite/Barcelona saga (if that\u2019s not being too dramatic) demonstrates the sheer arrogance of the club in recent times?\u201d says Rob Morgan. \u201cSigning him as an \u2018emergency\u2019 transfer outside the window, meaning that he couldn\u2019t be replaced by Leganes; hardly playing him when the squad was back to full health; publicly trying to get rid of him, but playing hardball with an exit fee and then also stating that they didn\u2019t want him to sign for Espanyol (which he duly ignored).\n\u201cIt was obvious that he was only ever going to be a squad player there, and I\u2019m not feeling too sorry for a guy who\u2019s just pocketed a couple of million quid, but where\u2019s the respect? Combined with things such as spending millions on new players while expecting other squad members to defer wages or even play for free, you must think that at some point this is going to deter players from wanting to go there? I\u2019m a neutral BTW \u2013 no dog in the La Liga/Champions League fight.\u201d\nOn the plus side, nobody will be able to utter the words \u201cMes Que Un Club\u201d with a straight face ever again.\n\n\n\n 3.35pm  \n\nAndre Gomes could be on his way out of Everton with Lille keen on signing the former Barcelona and Benfica midfielder on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old hasn\u2019t featured at all under Frank Lampard this season, though he did have an injury during pre-season, and has two years remaining on a lucrative contract at Goodison Park.\n\n\n\n 3.35pm  \n\n\u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Alan Gomes. \u201cFollowing the English transfer deadline is now something of a frightful experience if you\u2019re a fan of a club in continental Europe. The Premier League is now so financially dominant that many players would rather play for, say, Wolves or Bournemouth than for a team chasing titles in Portugal or the Netherlands.\n\u201cAs an FC Porto fan, I\u2019m nervously reading rumours and just hoping they don\u2019t materialise: Taremi to Chelsea... Evanilson to Man United... Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio to Arsenal... Gon\u00e7alo Borges to Everton... These are all almost certainly fluff, but it\u2019s still annoying that one\u2019s club is treated as a shop window. Well, I suppose we have been doing the same to clubs in Latin America, so what goes around etc. But still.\u201d \n\n\n\n 3.29pm  \n\nSky Sports News are reporting that Jan Bednarek\u2019s move from Southampton to West Ham is off, and that he\u2019s going to join Aston Villa on loan instead.

He\u2019s 33, but when he\u2019s motivated \u2013 as he was at Barcelona, where he scored 11 in 17 league games last season \u2013 he is still a major threat.\n\n\n\n 3.14pm  \n\n\u201cMore thoughts regarding the Premier League being the problem,\u201d says Dominic Stevenson. \u201cIt can make it feel disheartening to follow teams in other leagues, or other leagues in general, though it can, at times, create quite humorous situations. I am a Union Berlin fan, and whilst it was quite saddening to see Taiwo Awoniyi go to Nottingham Forest (of all places!), it is pretty funny that their squad has a market value of some \u20ac70m less than Bournemouth\u2019s or roughly equal to that of Phil Foden and yet they\u2019re Europa League qualifiers and are beating teams like Leipzig. Long live Union.\u201d\nThere\u2019s so much to loathe about the Premier League, and then you watch the actual football and your soul starts singing. I haven\u2019t had such an intense love/hate relationship since I first clocked the calorific content of Roysters crisps.\n\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\n\u201cA deadline day so unfamiliar that I even went to sleep,\u201d says Yash Gupta, \u201cand it\u2019s almost 18 hours since I last checked Twitter.

Anything teetering on the edge that you really want to see happen?\u201d\nThere\u2019s something teetering on the edge, but it\u2019s not a transfer.

They got themselves a new left-back.\n\n\n\n\n 1.36pm  \nChelsea agree Aubameyang deal\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang is on his way back to the Premier League from Barcelona after Chelsea agree a \u20ac14m fee with the Catalans.\n\n\n\n\n 1.33pm  \n\nLooks like Crystal Palace are leading the race to sign Ronnie Edwards from Peterborough. \n\n\n\n\n 1.28pm  \n\nNottingham Forest are still hoping to add to their squad, according to Steve Cooper. \n\u201cI think so (there will be new signings) and I hope so,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThere is nothing at this moment to say in terms of confirmation. Things are going on and it can be a little bit of a scramble on deadline day, not just for us, for any club, but we are certainly trying to do a few things. Some might come off, none of it might come off, so we will wait and see, but we are trying that is for sure.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.22pm  \n\nIn more non-deadline day news \u2026 Ed Aarons and Romain Molina on the latest goings on in Gabon.\n\n\n\n\n 1.19pm  \n\nBurnley have completed their 15th signing of the summer in the form of Halil Dervisoglu on loan from Brentford. He spent last season on loan at Galatasaray but has swapped Istanbul for Lancashire.\n\n\n\n\n 1.16pm  \n\n\u201cThanks for remaining sane amidst the madness,\u201d says Oliver James. \u201cOn Spurs\u2019 purported pursuit of Dan James, (any relation, Oliver?) who was to replace Bryan Gil, wouldn\u2019t it be better to (y\u2019know) keep a talented young player who\u2019s already at the club? Continuity and familiarity with patterns/tactics surely balances against the supermarket-sweepery of shiny new faces..?\n\u201cPerhaps I dislike all the lastminutery of it, but the dash for signings seems a bit crass given \u201ceverything\u201d in the world ...\u201d\nAm I remaining sane is the big question here? \nI suspect Antonio Conte must really have no fancied Gil. Will they go for someone else with James now seemingly off to Fulham?\n\n\n\n 1.13pm  \n\nK\u00e1ri Tulinius emails: \u201cDaniel mentioned how disquieting it is when mid-table Premier League teams raid big European clubs for their players. As a supporter of Stuttgart, it certainly caused me some anxiety to see that my club\u2019s star striker left for a relatively modest sum by today\u2019s standards, to Wolverhampton. Wolves have a gem in Sa\u0161a Kalajd\u017ei\u0107. He looks awkward but defenders always have trouble marking him. I worry for Stuttgart, who haven\u2019t really replaced him.\u201d\nThere is still time!\n\n\n\n 1.05pm  \n\nDaniel James has been linked to a number of clubs during the window but it looks like he will be leaving Leeds for the bright lights of London and Fulham.\n\n\n\n\n 1.03pm  \nWilly Boly signs for Nottingham Forest\n\nWilly Boly has completed his move to Nottingham Forest from Wolves, with the aforementioned two-year deal confirmed by the club.\n\nUpdated at 1.17pm BST\n\n\n 1.00pm  \n\nRighto, my watch is over \u2013 here\u2019s Will Unwin again to guide you through the next bit. Ta-ra. \n\n\n\n 12.58pm  \n\nAsked for his deal of the window, the aforementioned Brassell gives Mohamed Camara, signed by Monaco from Salzburg to replaced Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni. I\u2019veonly seen him for Mali, but heard he was great when his team drew at PSG on Sunday and will be looking out for him in future. \n\n\n\n 12.55pm  \n\nHe goes onto say that Arthur is much more of a Guardiola midfielder than a Klopp one, and he\u2019ll be glad to know I agree. But I guess the plan is that he\u2019ll only be at Anfield a year and will cover Thiago, also more Guardiola than Klopp \u2013 though if we cast our minds back a few seasons, to him dominating Spurs when Barcelona visited Wembley, we can remember that there\u2019s a serious player in there, and there\u2019s no one better at unlocking talent than Klopp. Vickery also makes the interesting point that Brazilian midfielders tend to find it harder to excel in Europe than Brazilian defenders and attackers \u2013 and by the sound of things, we\u2019ll get to see how he does, because that deal is, apparently, likely to go through. \n\n\n\n 12.51pm  \n\nTim Vickery says Danilo is useful to have around but not a world-beater; he thinks Palmeiras will want more than the \u00a320m they\u2019ve been offered and won\u2019t want to sell, at least not until January. \n\n\n\n 12.50pm  \n\nEmail! \u201cI might be late to the party on this one,\u201d says Darrien Bold, \u201cbut I\u2019ve just spotted tenacious midfielder Vinny Samways tucking into a sandwich in a trendy Liverpool cafe as rumours of him bolstering Everton\u2019s midfield for a cool \u00a32m do the rounds...\u201d\nI think he could play really well with Ian Wilson.\n\nUpdated at 12.58pm BST\n\n\n 12.40pm  \n\nThe Guardian is funded by readers like you.

West Ham and Aston Villa have also tracked the centre-back but Saints are hopeful of wrapping up a deal, having sanctioned the departures of Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek, with the pair set to move to Bournemouth and West Ham respectively. \n\n\n\n 12.39pm  \n\nMore Southampton news: they\u2019re close, apparently, so taking Duje \u0106aleta-Car from Marseille. He\u2019ll replace Jan Bednarek, who\u2019s off to West Ham as a replacement for Craig Dawson, who\u2019s off to probably Wolves. My guess is Southampton have the best of that little chain, and I\u2019ve never seen \u0106aleta-Car play. \n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nNews from Newcastle: they\u2019d like to take Harrison Ashby off West Ham. David Moyes is keen on the young right-back, but he\u2019s only got a year left on his contract, and you can see why he might fancy a move up north. \n\n\n\n 12.35pm  \n\nOh, and that aforementioned Spanish journo said that Atl\u00e9tico suits quite fancy Cristiano Ronaldo, but Diego Simeone is dead against. Imagine thinking you were well-placed to disagree with him; imagine telling him you disagree with him!\n\n\n\n 12.33pm  \n\nReading matter:\n\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nI should also note that Sky just had a Spanish journo on, wearing a t-shirt that read \u201cIN THE SHAPE OF MY LIFE\u201d. Great stuff. \n\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nI don\u2019t think this is quite certain enough to get the key event treatment, but apparently Fulham are still getting a striker \u2013 Carlos Vin\u00edcius, currently on loan from Benfica to PSV. On Sky, Andy Brassell, also of the Guardian, reckons Leeds have got by far the better player, noting that Dieng has serious potential. \n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nI know it\u2019s nothing new, but the way lower-half Premier League teams are relieving European giants of their best players is extremely disquieting. \n\n\n\n 12.24pm  \nLeeds agree fee in excess of \u00a310m for Marseille striker Bamba Dieng\n\nFulham were also in the mix but he\u2019s going to the River Aire, not the River Thames. \n\n\n\n 12.21pm  \n\nA bit more on City: Lucas Mbete, who is 18, a defender, and has three senior City appearances, is to go on loan to Huddersfield.\n\n\n\n 12.19pm  \n\nApparently Edson \u00c1lvarez has refused to train today, following Chelsea\u2019s bid for him yesterday. Thing is, the Dutch window closed last evening, so Ajax wouldn\u2019t be able to replace him and, presumably, having sold Seb Haller, Antony and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, with Ryan Gravenberch and Noussair Mazraoui. I what Jurien Timber makes of it all. \n\n\n\n 12.14pm  \n\nTalking of City kids, Rom\u00e9o Lavia, who left for Southampton in July, looks a player \u2013 as does Armel Bella-Kotchap, as it happens. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl might just be building something. \n\n\n\n 12.12pm  \n\nNews from our man in Manny \u2013 I still can\u2019t believe people call it that, but I am, as I said, 43: Sam Edozie and Juan Larios are at Southampton hoping to complete moves. Edozie, a 19 year old winger, may cost up to \u00a310m. Larios, who is 18 and primarily a left-back, will cost \u00a35m. \n\n\n\n 12.09pm  \n\nI\u2019m 43 years old, I shouldn\u2019t enjoy this, but I enjoyed this. Everything I hear of Antony tells me he\u2019s got what he\u2019ll need to wear a ludicrous price-tag and deliver. \n\n\n\n\n 12.06pm  \n\nArsenal have, apparently, offered \u00a320m for Douglas Luiz of Villa. I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll want to let him leave, but I also can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll want to stay, so. \n\n\n\n 12.05pm  \n\nWout Faes, the centre-back Leicester have just signed, will be in the crowd tonight, as the Foxes take on Man United. It\u2019s remarkable, really, that he\u2019s their first outfield acquisition of the summer \u2013 they desperately need something and will be hoping that he\u2019s it, or part of it. They are, though, also looking to get hold of a right-winger with Atalanta\u2019s J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga in their sights.\n\nUpdated at 12.19pm BST\n\n\n 12.02pm  \n\nThanks Will and happy transfer deadline day one and all! May we merit many more. \n\n\n\n 12.00pm  \n\nRight \u2026 I am off to find some lunch. In the meantime, I will leave you in the hands of Daniel Harris.\n\n\n\n 11.56am  \n\nThere is interest from Chelsea, among other clubs, in the Peterborough centre-back Ronnie Edwards, though no deal has been agreed. The teenager was part of England\u2019s triumphant Under-19s squad this summer. Posh co-owner Darragh MacAnthony previously christened Edwards \u201cnew stadium\u201d because he said the former Barnet defender would end up fetching a fee that would pay for a new ground \u2026 \n\n\n\n\n 11.53am  \n\nIn non-deadline day news \u2026 Yoshimi Yamashita, one of three women who will become the first female referees to officiate at a men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, said on Thursday she hoped to inspire girls in the region to become match officials.\n\n\n\n\n 11.51am  \n\nIt looks like Leeds will get some business done today. Bamba Dieng, who has been linked with a plethora of Premier League clubs, is on his way to Elland Road from Marseille.\n\n\n\n\n 11.49am  \nWolves accept Aston Villa offer for Dendoncker\n\nLeander Dendoncker looks set to join Aston Villa from Wolves after a \u00a313m fee was agreed. The Belgian\u2019s medical is expected to take place this afternoon.\nSpeaking of Belgians on the move, Leicester have completed the signing of Wout Faes from Reims. The defender has signed a five-year deal with the club.\n\nUpdated at 11.49am BST\n\n\n 11.46am  \n\n Check out all the deals from the women\u2019s game this summer. \n\n\n\n\n 11.28am  \n\nWolves are interested in signing the West Ham centre-half Craig Dawson. Were West Ham to sanction the sale they would want \u00a37m. \n\n\n\n 11.24am  \n\nDanny Rose has departed Watford, meaning he can join a club on a free transfer outside the window. He has Turkish Super Lig written all over him.\n\n\n\n\n 11.22am  \n\nSteven Gerrard wants Douglas Luiz to be an Aston Villa player come 11pm but last night hinted the Brazil midfielder could be sold. Villa have been in talks with Douglas Luiz over a new contract but a \u20ac15m bid for Leander Dendoncker suggests they have a contingency plan in place. Dendoncker\u2019s move to Villa Park looks likely. \u201cDouglas has got a year to go and it is one of those really touchy situations where the club has to do what is best for the club, even if it is not necessarily best for me,\u201d Gerrard said.\n\n\n\n 11.21am  \n\nThe word from inside Manchester United regarding Cristiano Ronaldo and his want-away wish is this will close to 100 per cent not occur. Only football\u2019s most important law: never say never prevents it being the deadest of dead certs. So: never say never but highly unlikely so tune in between now and the January transfer window to see how this narrative strand of The Manchester United Soap Opera starring CR7 and Erik ten Hag plays out \u2026\n\n\n\n 11.19am  \n\nArsenal midfielder James Olayinka will join League One Cheltenham Town on a permanent deal. \n\n\n\n 11.05am  \n\nAfter being linked with a \u00a377m move to Chelsea, Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol has agreed to extend his contract at RB Leipzig.\n\n\n\n\n 11.03am  \n\nManchester City have a new centre-back!\n\n\n\n\n 10.59am  \n\nBournemouth and Wolves, fresh from playing out a stalemate, both expect to be busy. Jack Stephens is joining the former on loan from Southampton, who are also happy to allow Jan Bednarek to depart. Aston Villa and West Ham both keen. \n\n\n\n 10.56am  \n\nArsenal intend to test Aston Villa\u2019s stance that Douglas Luiz is not for sale with a bid of about \u00a320m. The Brazil midfielder is out of contract next summer and Steven Gerrard admitted he may be powerless to keep him, despite Villa\u2019s determination to do so. The player is thought to be keen on a move, but has only 12 hours to make one. Douglas Luiz scored directly from a corner against Arsenal in defeat at the Emirates on Wednesday. Villa are pursuing a move for Leander Dendoncker, who was left on the bench for Wolves at Bournemouth. Wolves aim to sign a centre-back following the departure of Willy Boly to Nottingham Forest. They have offered a contract to the free agent Jason Denayer and are also keen on Craig Dawson from West Ham. In the east Midlands Leicester are set to wrap up a deal worth about \u00a315m for the Reims centre-back Wout Faes as a replacement for Wesley Fofana. \n\n\nUpdated at 11.29am BST\n\n\n 10.55am  \n\nDavid Squires on the transfer window \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 10.48am  \n\nI guess who suits their style as someone who is good at hitting teams on the break and Antonio Conte fancies a touch more variety on the bench.\n\n\n\n\n 10.45am  \n\nAinsley Maitland-Niles is on his way to Southampton but will sign a new deal with Arsenal, despite there being an option to make the deal permanent. I am sure there is a business logic involved but my simple mind cannot compute.\n\n\n\n\n 10.40am  \n\nTottenham\u2019s surprise enquiry for Leeds\u2019s Dan James looks doomed to fail, as things stand, because they want him on an initial loan, which is a non-starter for the Yorkshire club.\n\n\n\n 10.39am  \n\nIdeally, Eddie Howe would sign a midfielder today but, although a loan is not out of the question, Newcastle\u2019s options have receded and they may now wait until January.\nHowever there are a few outgoings; while Martin Dubravka is expected to finalise a season-long loan at Manchester United with a view to a \u00a36m move next summer, Federico Fernandez seems set to head to Spain for a loan at Elche - unless Stoke manage to hijack that move - and Matty Longstaff in en route to another loan with Barnsley.\nSlovakia\u2019s Dubravka has lost his place in goal to Nick Pope this season, while Fernandez has been pushed down the central defensive pecking order by Sven Botman\u2019s arrival. At 33 the immensely popular Argentinian - who will be much missed at St James\u2019 Park where he is regarded as an extremely positive dressing room influence and is known for organising excellent South American style barbecues - wants to play regularly. So, too, does Matty Longstaff. The younger brother of Newcastle\u2019s Sean Longstaff, his career has stalled in the three years since he marked his debut by scoring against Manchester United. Barnsley have an option to buy Matty should the loan work out well.\n\n\n\n 10.31am  \n\nI think this is the first time I have watched Sky Sports News for more than 30 seconds in a year. Not sure how much of the \u2018We are hearing team X might bid for player X\u2019 I can take. \n\n\n\n 10.20am  \n\nAfter a tough summer of Barcelona pretty much forcing Martin Braithwaite to leave, he has finally found a new club and will not even need to move house.\n\n\n\n\n 10.18am  \n\nFrom the archives \u2026 Scott Murray on deadline buys.\n\n\n\n\n 10.05am  \n\nThere is an outgoing at Southampton, who have sold Oriol Romeu to La Liga side Girona. The Catalan started his career at Barcelona and is back in Spain after 11 years in England, following a move to Chelsea in 2011. \n\n\n\n 10.02am  \n\nJamie Jackson has plenty more on Antony\u2019s arrival at Manchester United.\n\n\n\n\n 10.00am  \nManchester City sign Akanji from Borussia Dortmund\n\nManuel Akanji is a Manchester City player. The defender joins from Borussia Dortmund for \u00a316.7m, and has signed a contract until 2027. The move came out of the blue a couple of days ago and means City now have five senior centre-backs, with John Stones, R\u00faben Dias, Aymeric Laporte and Nathan Ak\u00e9 already on the books.\n\u201cIt was a bit unexpected in the last stage of the transfer market, but I had no doubts about moving,\u201d Akanji said. \u201cI\u2019m here to prove myself. I want to show everyone that they were right in choosing me.\u201d\nThey have already signed one player from Borussia Dortmund this summer, so this could work out quite well for City.\nCity teased the deal a few minutes ago.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.02am BST\n\n\n 9.56am  \n\nLiverpool are attempting to sign Brazil midfielder Arthur Melo on a season-long loan from Juventus. The 26-year-old, who swapped Barcelona for Turin as part of the deal for Miralem Pjanic in 2020, has been made available by the Italian club and received an offer from Liverpool. The deal would be a loan with no obligation to buy, leaving the path clear for Jurgen Klopp to move for long-time target Jude Bellingham at Borussia Dortmund next summer.\nKlopp was satisfied with his midfield options earlier in the summer but a raft of injuries has prompted a change of heart. His latest problem concerns captain Jordan Henderson, who sustained a hamstring injury against Newcastle last night and is expected to miss Saturday\u2019s Merseyside derby. Henderson will undergo a scan in the next 24 hours with doubts already surfacing over his availability to face Chelsea on 18 September.\n\n\n\n\n 9.54am  \n\nCheck out our comprehensive list of all the transfers from the big five European leagues.\n\n\n\n\n 9.47am  \n\nIt is already starting to feel like a three coffee kind of day. In addition to the usual scratching around for players to fill space on the bench there will be a few big deals today. Everyone working hard to get things over the line. \nWhich summer signing are you most excited about?\n\n\n\n 9.39am  \n\nFill your boots with rumours.\n\n\n\n\n 9.37am  \n\nIn unsurprising news, Antony is very pleased to join Manchester United on a deal running to 2027. I spoke to an Eredivisie full-back who said the Brazilian is the best he has come up against in the league. Now he just needs to prove it in England.\n\u201cThis is an incredible moment in my career to be joining one of the most iconic clubs in the world,\u201d Antony said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to everyone who has believed in me, especially my family, and all my coaches and team-mates, because I could not have got here without them.\n\u201cPlaying under Erik ten Hag at Ajax was perfect for me and my development. His style of football and coaching brings out the best in me, and I am excited by what he has told me about his plans and ambitions in Manchester.\n\u201cMy time at Ajax was fantastic and I will always be grateful for the trust they put in me, but now I am ready for the next challenge, and I can\u2019t wait to join my new team-mates and play my part in bringing success to Manchester United.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 9.41am BST\n\n\n 9.31am  \n\nIt looks like Liverpool will get the midfielder they need. Arthur Melo is set to join from Juventus, according to Fabrizio Romano. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s need for more bodies in the engine room was highlighted on Wednesday night after Jordan Henderson picked up an injury in the win over Newcastle.\n\n\n\n\n 9.30am  \nAntony completes \u20ac100m move to Manchester United\n\nManchester United have completed the signing of Antony from Ajax in a deal worth \u20ac100m. The Brazilian made it clear he wanted to leave the Eredivisie to move to the Premier League, and he has his wish. It\u2019s an exciting signing for Manchester United fans.\nUnited are still in the market for a second-choice goalkeeper, with Newcastle\u2019s Martin Dubravka the key target. \n\n\n\n\n 9.16am  \n\nManchester City are closing on a deal for Manuel Akanji. The Swiss international will make it five senior centre-backs at the club. It is being reported that his imminent arrival means youngster Luke Mbete will be allowed to depart on loan to Huddersfield.\n\n\n\n\n 9.12am  \n\nHas United\u2019s summer been a success in the market? Erik ten Hag believes circumstances have not helped. \n\n\n\n\n 9.07am  \n\nSend in your favourite panic buys of deadline days past. I will kick off with Andy Carroll joining Liverpool from Newcastle for \u00a335m. \n\n\n\n\n 9.02am  \n\n A little news from me \u2026 Nottingham Forest will complete a deal for Wolves defender Willy Boly before the close of play. Two-year deal agreed with the centre-back.\n\n\n\n 9.01am  \n\nSome early bad news for Brentford, courtesy of Nick Ames, who knows his Ukrainian football.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.01am BST\n\n\n 9.00am  \nChelsea close on Aubameyang deal\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s very own Fabrizio Romano will be leading the way with all the news. It looks like Chelsea will get the No 9 they so desperately need. Although, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang will arrive with a broken jaw after a burglary at his home.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.13am BST\n\n\n 9.00am  \nPreamble\n\nWelcome one and all to this most wonderful of events: Transfer Deadline Day. It only comes round twice a year so we really need to make the most of it. \nI will be bringing you the very latest news from our correspondents, rumours and done deals from across the continent as clubs look to do some last-minute shopping. It seems everyone in the Premier League is still keen on adding to their squads, which will add an extra layer of intrigue because wherever we look something might be about to happen. What a celebration of capitalism this will be.\nManchester City still want a centre-back, Arsenal have high hopes of bringing in a fresh face or two, Chelsea need a striker and Liverpool might even be convinced to shell out on a midfielder. \nThere will be no shortage of deals done today, I am sure. We will go through the leagues to pick out the best under the radar transfers the Football League has to offer.\nIn England, the window closes at 11pm BST. Deals can be done after that, but that is the key time to keep in mind. I will be with you until lunch and then some other yellow ticker fanatics will take you through to the most bitter of ends. \nLet the fun commence! \n\n"

                    "body": "  3.36pm   Summary  Time for a recap. Growth at UK factories has slowed, with bosses reporting a slowdown in output and new orders. With demand cooling, fewer manufacturers expect to raise prices over the next quarter. British consumers have been hit by the sharpest increase in grocery bills in 13 years. Supermarkets are around 8.3% more expensive than a year ago, adding \u00a3380 to the average spend on food this year. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has predicted that further interest rate rises will be needed to cool UK inflation. Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk has said it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that the US will enter recession soon. Economist Nouriel Roubini, and Goldman Sachs, have also voiced concerns that a downturn could be near. The US housing market has continud to cool, with existing home sales hitting their lowest rate in almost two years.  Food giant Kellogg Co is splitting into three companies, sending its shares up almost 3%. Kellogg plans to focus on snacks, and will spin off its North American cereals division, and its plant-based foods. The hospitality industry has warned that today\u2019s UK rail strikes will cost restaurants, pubs and other businesses \u00a3500m in revenue.  Footfall in central London to 1pm today has been 27% lower than last Tuesday and in city centres outside of the capital it was down by 11.2%, according to retail analysts Springboard.  The commodity trader Glencore has pleaded guilty in a London court to seven counts of bribery related to its oil operations in several African countries.  Rolls-Royce is to give more than 14,000 staff a \u00a32,000 payment to help them cope with the soaring cost of living, the first time the engineering firm has made such a move.  EasyJet cabin crew unions in Spain have called nine days of strikes in July, threatening to add to a summer of disruption for airline passengers.  Stock markets have clawed back some of last week\u2019s heavy losses, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 30 points or 0.4% in late trading, and solid gains on Wall Street. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning, when UK inflation could climb to a new 40-year high.... GW  Updated at 3.39pm BST    3.15pm   US home sales drop  Just in: Sales of US homes fell last month as the once red-hot housing market cools. Sales of existing US homes (excluding new builds) dropped by 3.4% in May to the lowest rate since June 2020, during the first wave of Covid-19. That follows a 2.6% drop in April, as rising US interest rates deter potential buyers.  Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, predicted that home sales would fall further:  \u201cThe impact of higher mortgage rates are not yet fully reflected in the data.\u201d   Prices kept rising, though, supported by a lack of supply. The median house price hit $407,600 in May, up 14.8% on May 2021.     3.04pm         3.00pm    Coca-Cola\u2019s chief executive James Quincey has warned that companies are facing a \u201cvery painful\u201d three years from a geopolitical and macroeconomic point of view, Reuters reports.   Efforts to move to a recycling-oriented circular economy will have to be made \u201cin the face of what is likely to be a very painful next zero to three years from a macroeconomic and geopolitical point of view,\u201d Quincey told the Consumer Goods Forum\u2019s Global Summit conference in Dublin on Tuesday.       2.57pm    Stocks have opened higher in New York, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 460 points, or 1.5%, at 30,349 points.  Fiona Cincotta of City Index remains cautious, pointing out that markets just had their worst week since 2020.  High inflation and aggressive central bank tightening raised fears of recession last week sending stocks tumbling to levels last seen in 2020 in the pandemic. The S&amp;P fell 5.8% dropping into a bear market, down over 20% from its early January record high. The fact that the market has entered a bear market doesn\u2019t mean that it will stop falling. In fact, today\u2019s rise isn\u2019t a risk reset at all, fundamentally nothing has changed since last week. It isn\u2019t unusual for stocks to rise after a heavy selloff. Given that a recession isn\u2019t fully priced in there could well be more decline to come.   Updated at 3.00pm BST    2.48pm         2.33pm    US growth slowed sharply in May, according to a closely watched survey from the Chicago Federal Reserve. The Chicago Fed\u2019s national activity index weakened to +0.01 in May, down from +0.40 in April. That suggests economic growth declined in May, with only a marginal expansion.       2.24pm    Overnight, Goldman Sachs economists cut their US growth forecasts and warned that the risk of recession is rising. The Goldman team now sees a 30% probability of America entering a recession over the next year, up from 15% previously. If a recession is avoided, there\u2019s then a 25% \u2018conditional probability\u2019 of entering a recession in the following year. That implies a 48% cumulative probability in the next two years versus 35% previously, Bloomberg explains.      2.12pm    Kellogg\u2019s split comes at a particularly perilous time in the industry due to rising costs, both for labour and for material, points out Associated Press.  Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has pushed grain prices higher and this month, the U.S. reported that inflation is hitting four-decade highs. Last fall, about 1,400 workers at Kellogg\u2019s cereal plants went on strike for nearly three months before winning a new contract with immediate, across the board wage increases and enhanced benefits for all workers. In March, few hundred other workers at a plant the makes Cheez-Its won a new contract with 15% wage increases over three years.       1.33pm   Kellogg to split in three, in new focus on snacks   US food giant Kellogg has announced plans to split into three companies, as it focuses on snacks. Kellogg, which began in 1894 when W.K Kellogg created Corn Flakes, has announced it will spin off its North American cereals and plant-based food divisions in two new companies. Shares in Kellogg have jumped over 6% in pre-market trading, as it become the latest major US firm to break itself up.  Kellogg says the snack division made $11.4bn of net sales last year, or about 80% of total sales. It is focused on global snacking, international cereal and noodles, and North America frozen breakfast.  Brands include Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Kellogg\u2019s breakfast cereals, Frosties, Coco-Pops, and Crunchy Nut. This business is expected to be a higher-growth company than today\u2019s Kellogg Company, it says.  CEO Steve Cahillane, who will become chairman and CEO of the global snacking company, says splitting up the company makes sense:  \u201cThese businesses all have significant standalone potential, and an enhanced focus will enable them to better direct their resources toward their distinct strategic priorities.\u201d  The names of the new businesses haven\u2019t been decided yet. \u201cThe North America Cereal Co.\u201d, brought in $2.4bn in net sales last year, and will operate in the U.S., Canada, and Caribbean. \u201cPlant Co.\u201d, which includes the MorningStar Farms brand, had $340m of net sales last year, and will be focus on plant-based foods. In the past two years major U.S. firms such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Electric Co have both announced splits.    Updated at 1.34pm BST    12.46pm   Markest up despite recession fears - but is it just a bear market rally?  Back in the markets... European stocks are holding their earlier gains, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 now up 0.8%, or 56 points, at 7177 points. Investors are anticipating that Wall Street will open higher, after the Juneteenth holiday on Monday. A positive start to New York trading would be a relief after the S&amp;P 500 plunged into a bear market last week.  But with recession fears swirling (as Elon Musk has shown), the economic picture is still troubling.  The FT\u2019s Naomi Rovnick writes:  Hani Redha, multi-asset portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, characterised Tuesday\u2019s moves as a \u201cbear market rally,\u201d caused by a \u201cpsychological desire\u201d for a shift in the market mood.   \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really change the bigger picture of growth slowing down and tightening financial conditions,\u201d he added. \u201cThat combination still remains the overarching theme, which is pretty challenging.\u201d    Updated at 12.54pm BST    12.37pm    Recession worries are also rising in Germany. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) more than halved its economic forecast for 2022 this morning, predicting German gross domestic product will only grow by 1.5% this year. Before the Ukraine war began, it forecast growth of 3.5% The BDI also said a halt in Russian gas deliveries would make recession inevitable in Europe\u2019s largest economy.       11.59am    Britain\u2019s postal workers could soon join railway staff in taking industrial action over pay.  The Communications Workers Union has announced it is serving notice for a national ballot on pay at the postal group Royal Mail. It is seeking an inflation-based, no strings pay award. Papers will be sent to CWU members on the 28th of June, with the result due three weks later. The results of the ballot would inform a decision on whether to take industrial action. CWU\u2019s deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger said, in a video posted on Twitter, that the union will recommend industrial action if there\u2019s not been any movement on the pay claim by then. Pullinger said:  \u201cToday we will be serving a notice on Royal Mail Group over a pay claim, our claim for an inflation-based no strings pay award. The company has imposed a 2% pay award, miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate. \u201cWe will have the result on the 19th of July. At that point, depending on where we are, we will make decision as whether we need to take industrial action, and if there has been no movement that is exactly what we will be recommending.\u201d  Pullinger added that Royal Mail\u2019s CEO, Simon Thompson, received a bonus of more than \u00a3140,000, taking his overall package to over \u00a3700,000 last year.  Royal Mail has said it doesn\u2019t believe there are grounds for industrial action, and that its pay offer is worth up to 5.5% [including a 2% productivity bonus, and agreement on changes to conditions such as an expanded Sunday parcel delivery offer]. A Royal Mail spokesperson said:  \u201cWe offered a deal worth up to 5.5% for CWU grade colleagues, the biggest increase we have offered for many years, which was rejected by the CWU.\u201d  Last month, communications regulator Ofcom announced a formal investigation into Royal Mail, after almost a fifth of first-class deliveries arrived at least a day late in the year to April.       11.26am   UK factory growth softens  Growth at UK manufacturers is slowing and order books have softened, in another sign that economic demand is easing. The CBI\u2019s latest survey of British factories has found that manufacturing output growth slowed slightly in the three months to June, and is expected to ease further in the three months ahead. Output increased in 12 out of 17 sectors in the three months to June, led by the motor vehicles and aerospace sub-sectors. But the food, drink &amp; tobacco sub-sector shrank for the first time in just over a year. Factory bosses reported that export order books fell back to a normal level in June, but were still above their long-term averages. Encouragingly, fewer manufacturers plan to raise their prices than earlier this year. A net balance of 58% of firms expected domestic price growth for the three months ahead, down from 75% in May and a survey record of +80% in March 2022.  That is the weakest expectations for selling price inflation since September 2021 (although significantly above the long-run average).  Signs of weaker growth could be deterring some firms from raising prices. Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, explains:  \u201cWhile manufacturing output is still being supported by a backlog of orders, growth appears to be softening. Stocks of finished goods are now seen as broadly adequate and we may be seeing the first signs that weaker activity is beginning to slow the pace of price increases in the sector. Manufacturers continue to report a range of challenges, including significant cost pressures, shipping delays, shortages of key inputs, and, not least, recruitment difficulties. Skills shortages remain widespread and are a key constraint on growth. All of these trends are weighing on confidence.\u201d        10.50am         10.39am    There could be more disruption to flights next month, as Spain-based easyJet\u2019s cabin staff will go on strike for nine days in July, The workers will walk out July 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 29, 30 and 31 to protest against low wages, Miguel Galan, the general secretary of union USO\u2019s easyJet section, told reporters this morning. Yesterday easyJet announced it would cut its summer flight schedule, as staff shortages left airlines and airports unable to handle the increase in travel as Covid restrictions were lifted.      10.32am   Full story: Britons face paying \u00a3380 a year more as supermarket inflation hits 13-year high  Supermarket inflation hit 8.3% in the past month, the highest rate in 13 years, adding \u00a3380 to annual bills as the rising cost of living weighs on families, my colleague Sarah Butler reports: Sales fell at all the big supermarkets as shoppers switched to discounters Aldi and Lidl and bought more own-label goods in an effort to keep a lid on spending, according to the latest data from Kantar. Sales of supermarkets\u2019 cheapest own-label products rose 12% while Aldi and Lidl\u2019s sales rose by 7.9% and 9.5% respectively in the three months to 12 June. Aldi\u2019s share of the grocery market is 9.6%, less than 1% behind Morrisons where sales fell by 7.2% in the three-month period making it the biggest loser in the market. Here\u2019s the full story:  Despite the money-saving trend, families splashed out during the platinum jubilee celebrations, buying a third more alcohol and 35% more ice-cream than during an average week, according to Kantar. Sales of lemon curd were also up 16% as many people had a go at making the official jubilee trifle.     10.22am    The pound has gained against the US dollar, as traders anticipate that UK interest rates will keep rising. Sterling is up 0.5% today at $1.2314, following Huw Pill\u2019s warning that further tightening is needed. The pound dropped below $1.20 last week for the first time since the first pandemic lockdowns in March 2020, but it looking perkier this week. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the Bank ought to do more to protect the pound, as a weak currency pushed up import costs.  Interesting comments from Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill this morning on sterling, saying they should take into account the exchange rate, though he stressed it is not the target. But given a lot of the inflation in Britain is imported dollar-based inflation \u2013 ie rising dollar prices on global markets - the Bank would do well to do more to defend the currency. Catherine Mann, one of the MPC\u2019s hawkish dissenters last week, called [on Monday] for more rapid interest rate rises and warned the BoE was in danger of falling behind the Fed.       10.03am   BoE chief economist sees further rate rises ahead  The Bank of England will need to raise interest rates further in the near future to tackle surging inflation, its chief economist Huw Pill says. Pill told the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales this morning that the Bank was ready to act:  \u201cWe will do what we need to do to get inflation back to target. And at least in my view, that will require further tightening of monetary policy over the coming months.   Last week, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee raised interest rates for the fifth time in a row, from 1% to 1.25%. Pill was one of six policymakers who backed this, while three voted for a larger rise to 1.5%.  Some economists predict the Bank could act more aggressively in August, with a 50-bp hike that would take Bank Rate to 1.75%. Yesterday, fellow MPC member Catherine Mann called for more rapid rate rises, to prevent a weak pound pushing up imported inflation.   Mann pointed out that other central banks such as the Fed and the ECB expect to lift their borrowing costs, which would hit sterling if the BoE lagged behind. She also suggested rates could then be cut to support growth, once the inflationary shock had ebbed. Pill, though, says monetary policy was a \u2018blunt instrument\u2019, which must focus on its main goal of controlling inflation, rather than trying to stabilise the exchange rate or economic activity. Pill told the ICAEW:  \u201cMonetary policy is not a panacea. Monetary policy is not an instrument that allows you to achieve lots and lots of different things at short term: stabilise the exchange rate, fine-tune developments in employment or activity.       9.56am    Economist Nouriel Roubini is also warning that the US could be in recession soon. Roubini (who predicted the 2008 financial crisis) pointed out that US consumer confidence, retail sales, and both manufacturing and housing activity had all slowed, as inflation rises sharply (it hit a 40-year high of 8.6% last month).      9.31am   Elon Musk: US recession more likely than not in near term  Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has warned that the US economy could soon fall into recession. In an interview with Bloomberg News at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha this morning, Musk said it appears \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the US economy enters recession in the near term. Asked about president Biden\u2019s prediction that a recession was \u201cnot inevitable\u201d despite rising inflation, Musk pointed out that it will happen eventually... and quite possibly soon. Musk said:  \u201cA recession is inevitable at some point. As to whether there is a recession in the near term, I think that is more likely than not. It\u2019s not a certainty, but it appears more likely than not.  Musk isn\u2019t alone. A poll of academic economists earlier this month found that nearly 70% predict the US economy will tip into a recession next year, as the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates aggressively in an attempt to cool inflation.  During the interview, Musk also said Tesla plans to cut its salaried workforce by about 10% over the next three months, which will work out as a 3.5% cut in total headcount. Musk said:  \u201cTesla is reducing its salaried workforce roughly 10% over the next three months or so. We expect to grow our hourly workforce. We grew very fast on the salaried side, grew a little too fast in some areas\u201d   Musk added that supply constraints were the biggest brake on Tesla\u2019s growth, rather than competition from rival automakers. On his planned takeover of Twitter, Musk said there are still a few \u201cunresolved matters\u201d, including the issue of how many bots are on the social media platform [earlier this month he threatened to walk away from the deal] And asked whether he would support Donald Trump in the next US presidential election, Musk said he was \u201cundecided at this point on that election.\u201d        Updated at 9.49am BST    9.08am    European stock markets have opened higher, as shares continue to recover from last week\u2019s slump. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index is 0.6% higher, up 40 poist at 7161 points, rallying back after hitting a three-month low on Friday. But online grocer Ocado has tumbled over 5%, after tapping investors for \u00a3575m to find its expansion plans. Ocado said it wanted the cash to \u201cinvest in innovation at a faster pace\u201d.  The fund-raising comes as the pandemic boom in home deliveries fades, and customers look for cheaper groceries. Fitch, the credit rating agency, last night downgraded its outlook on Ocado to negative on Monday, and warned it would take longer than expected for the UK-listed group\u2019s international operations to turn a profit.  The pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 1%, with gains in Germany, France, Milan and Madrid.     8.54am   Hospitality industry expected to lose \u00a3500m of revenue from strikes  Today\u2019s UK rail strikes are going to cost the hospitality industry\u2019s restaurants, pubs and other businesses \u00a3500m in revenue, the CEO of UKHospitality said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Kate Nicholls said with businesses shutting early, or not opening in response to the rail strikes, hospitality employees also won\u2019t be able to work.   This strike will also not only have an impact this week, it will hit consumer confidence going forward. And as a result of the pandemic, one in three of our businesses have no cash reserves, one in five have still not returned to making a profit. So they are incredibly fragile and they cannot withstand anymore of these severe economic shocks.  My colleague Geneva Abdul is live-blogging today\u2019s industrial action on the transport network, here:      8.53am   Rolls-Royce offers workers \u00a32,000 to help ease cost of living crisis  The UK\u2019s escalating cost-of-living squeeze has prompted engineering group Rolls-Royce to offer a \u00a32,000 payment to around 14,000 UK staff. The aircraft engineering group told staff on Monday that it would give the cash lump sum to 11,000 shop-floor workers as well as 3,000 junior managers. The shop-floor workers are also being offered a 4% pay rise for 2022, backdated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson said the company was offering the majority of its staff a cash lump sum of \u00a32,000 \u201cto help them through the current exceptional economic climate\u201d.  He said it was the first time the company has paid out a cash lump sum that is not linked to performance, but to the economic climate, adding:  \u201cIn addition, we are offering our shopfloor staff the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade, back-dated to March, and together these measures represent around a 9% pay increase for them.\u201d      8.37am    Despite rising food bills, Britons did splash out on the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Sales during the week of the Platinum Jubilee (which included two bank holidays) were \u00a387m higher than in an average week, with an increase in alcohol and and ice cream.     8.37am    Market leader Tesco and Aldi and Lidl were the only groups to increase their market share on a sales value basis over the 12 weeks.  Only the discounters increased sales, Kantar reports, as customers tried to make their money stretch further. Supermarket sales fell by 1.9% during the 12 weeks to June 12 year-on-year, but were up 0.4% in the last four weeks.     8.18am   Introduction: Grocery inflation hit 13-year high  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. UK consumers are facing the steepest increase in food bills in 13 years, as the cost of living crisis hits households. Grocery price inflation jumped to 8.3% over the four weeks to June 12 - up from 7% a month earlier and its highest level since April 2009, new figures from data firm Kantar show. This means annual grocery bills will jump by \u00a3380 this year, adding to the burden on people who also face surging energy bills and record price for petrol and diesel at the pumps.  Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says food bills are rising sharply:  \u201cThis is over 100 pounds more than the number we reported in April this year, showing just how sharp price increases have been recently and the impact inflation is having on the sector,\u201d  With food prices jumping, shoppers are increasingly swapping branded items for cheaper own-label products. Kantar reports that sales of branded products fell by 1% in the 12 weeks to June 12, while own-label sales rose by 2.9% and value own-label lines jumped by 12%. McKevitt said sales of own-label lines have been \u201cboosted by Aldi and Lidl\u2019s strong performances, both of whom have extensive own-label repertoires\u201d, adding:  \u201cWe can also see consumers turning to value ranges, such as Asda Smart Price, Co-op Honest Value and Sainsbury\u2019s Imperfectly Tasty, to save money.\u201d  We reported last month that the UK\u2019s \u201cgolden era\u201d of cheap food was over, and Kantar\u2019s figures confirm that the squeeze on households is getting worse.  Also coming up today Britain\u2019s biggest nationwide rail strike for 30 years has begun, leaving train passengers facing widespread disruption and cancellations as workers responsible for train lines and infrastructure across the UK walked out. Industry leaders fear the economic disruption will be considerable, as travellers and commuters decide to stay at home, with strikes also planned for Thursday and Saturday.  Last-ditch talks yesterday failed to resolve the bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions, with all sides blaming each other for the lack of progress. The RMT said train operating companies made a late pay offer yesterday, believed to be about 2-3%, with strings attached and no guarantees against compulsory redundancies. That\u2019s a long way below inflation, which hit 9% in April. Richard Burge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned that the capital \u201ccannot afford a summer of chaos on the railways and tube lines\u201d, given the slowing economy.  \u201cWhile this strike will be damaging, a recession is looking likely regardless; as such, I wouldn\u2019t pin an eventual recession on this strike.\u201d   The agenda  8am BST: Kantar\u2019s report on UK grocery sector 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factories in May 1.30pm BST: Chicago Fed National Activity Index 3pm BST: US existing home sales for May   "

This followed the hottest ever night recorded, with temperatures failing to dip below 25C in some parts, but relief should arrive shortly in the shape of thunderstorms on Wednesday, the forecaster said.\nScotland recorded its highest ever temperature, reaching 34.8C in Charterhall in the Scottish Borders, according to provisional Met Office figures. It exceeded the previous record of 32.9C recorded in Greycrook on 9 August 2003.\nAt least 13 people have died going into open water during the heatwave period, of which at least four were under the age of 17. Water safety organisations are concerned the toll may climb as schools break for summer holidays.\nThe London fire brigade declared a major incident in response to a huge surge in fires across the capital. Firefighters described blazes tearing through homes and buildings in London as \u201cabsolute hell\u201d with residents evacuated and people taken to hospital. Residents were evacuated from their homes in the village of Wennington, east London, while flames destroyed buildings and ravaged nearby fields. Two people were also taken to hospital suffering smoke inhalation following a fire in Dagenham.\nGreater Manchester police are appealing for information about fires suspected to have been started deliberately on the moorland behind Dovestones reservoir. \nUK transport secretary says Britain must \u2018drive up\u2019 railway standards. Grant Shapps said the Victorian-era infrastructure \u201cwasn\u2019t built to withstand this type of temperature\u201d. He added these events will occur more frequently, and it will take decades to upgrade existing lines to be more resilient.\nLondon\u2019s ambulance service is experiencing a sustained demand for 999 and 111 services. The service said it was answering 400 calls an hour as it sees \u201can increase in the number of patients experiencing heat exposure\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.29pm BST\n\n\n 11.13pm  \n\nAfter a major incident was declared in South Yorkshire, Doncaster Council said in a statement: \u201cThere have been a number of fires in Doncaster today due to the extremely high temperatures.\n\u201cSome of these are ongoing and we are continuing to work with agencies across the borough and also colleagues across South Yorkshire to respond to and manage these incidents\u201d\nThe council said power cuts have also caused problems in the region.\nIt said: \u201cThere have also been a number of power outages, which are being caused by the high temperatures today too.

But as new lines go in, as new overhead cables go in, all of that is now spec\u2019d at a higher level than it would have been when those electric cables originally went in. We need to drive up the standards. We\u2019re going to see these events more frequently, and as a result we need to be ready.\n\nWhen asked how long it would take to upgrade existing rail infrastructure to become more resilient, Shapps told Sky News it would take \u201cdecades\u201d to replace, along with road tarmac. \nAnd when asked if the transport system can cope with the weather, Shapps said: \u201cthe simple answer at the moment is no.\u201d \n\nUpdated at 4.50pm BST\n\n\n 4.33pm  \n\nClimate scientists have expressed shock at the UK\u2019s smashed temperature record, with the heat soaring above 40C for the first time ever on Tuesday.\nResearchers are also increasingly concerned that extreme heatwaves in Europe are occurring more rapidly than models had suggested, indicating that the climate crisis on the continent may be even worse than feared.\nRead more here: \n\n\n\n\n 4.23pm  \n\nThe London fire brigade says 60 firefighters and eight fire engines are tackling a blaze in Wembley, where a video has shown clouds of black smoke billowing from behind a row of storefronts and flats.\nThe brigade said they have taken more than 40 calls to the fire. \n\n\nUpdated at 4.30pm BST\n\n\n 4.14pm  \n\nTemperatures in various places across the UK have now risen past 40C.

Fifteen people were evacuated from their homes, and people are being urged to stay away from the park today.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.16pm BST\n\n\n 9.38am  \n\nParts of Europe are experiencing the same unusually high temperatures as the UK, with wildfires raging in the south-west as the heatwave moves north to Belgium and the Netherlands.Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, and Sam Jones, Madrid correspondent, have the full story:\n\n\nUpdated at 9.38am BST\n\n\n 9.27am  \n\nNetwork Rail has said the hottest rail recorded yesterday was 62C in Suffolk.\nThe operator explains that rail temperature can be about 20\u00b0C higher than air temperature, causing it to expand, bend and break.To prevent this, trains have been running more slowly and there are fewer services available.\n\n\n\n\n 9.17am  \n\nScotland is also bracing for temperatures highs, which could exceed the August 2003 record of 32.9C at Greycrook in the Scottish Borders.\nThe Met Office has issued an amber weather warning \u2013 for extreme heat in eastern, southern and central parts of Scotland \u2013 which is in force until midnight on Wednesday.Holyrood minister Keith Brown has urged people \u201cto think about whether they need to travel and, if they do, make sure they\u2019re properly equipped and plan their journey in advance\u201d.On Monday, temperatures climbed to 31.3C in Aboyne in Aberdeenshire and Leuchars in Fife, the Met Office said.The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh recorded 30.8C and temperatures peaked at 29.9C in Aviemore.On Tuesday, Edinburgh is predicted to reach 31C, while Glasgow will see the mercury rise to around 28C. But in Aboyne, thermometers could reach 32C, and in Coldstream, in the Scottish Borders, temperatures could soar to 34C. The rising temperatures brought disruption to parts of Scotland\u2019s transport system on Monday, with overhead wires tripping and resetting due to the heat between Glasgow Queen Street Low Level and Hyndland.Scottish Water has asked people to be as efficient with their water as possible owing to scarcity in some regions, and urged them to use watering cans rather than hoses in gardens, not to fill up paddling pools and to take shorter showers.Meanwhile, the Scottish fire and rescue service (SFRS) has warned that the wildfire risk in southern and eastern parts of Scotland has risen to \u201cvery high\u201d. It said that, in prolonged periods of high temperatures, the risk of wildfires breaking out increases.SFRS deputy assistant chief officer Bruce Farquharson said: \n\n At this time of year, the ground vegetation is a combination of green growth, with a relatively high moisture content, and dead vegetation lying on top, which can easily ignite and spread quickly over a large area.\nDuring the next few days, I would urge the public to avoid lighting fires outdoors but, if you must, check for restrictions or permissions required by the landowner and make sure you use a fire safe pit or container that can be properly extinguished before you leave.\nWe need people to be aware of how quickly things can get out of hand \u2013 the smallest outdoor ignition can spread rapidly and burn for days. Therefore, we are asking people to act responsibly when enjoying the outdoors and please think twice before using anything involving a naked flame.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.59am BST\n\n\n 9.04am  \n\nMet Office chief meteorologist Neil Armstrong has a helpful explanation of what the chances are of the UK reaching 40C today and what this would represent:\n\nEven higher maximum temperatures will develop tomorrow with a 70% chance of somewhere in England exceeding 40\u00b0C. A value of this level would exceed the current UK record by 1.3\u00b0C or more. This is akin to a marathon runner shaving 20 minutes off of the current record.\n\nThis is the first time the Met Office has ever forecasted temperatures of 40C in the UK. The forecaster explains:\n\n Weather forecast models are run numerous times to help us quantify the likelihood of a particular event occurring and estimate the uncertainty which is always present in weather forecasting to some degree. Some models are now producing a 70% chance of maximum temperatures in excess of 40\u00b0C in isolated parts of the UK for the start of next week. Mid- to high-30s Celsius will be seen more widely with a 95% chance we will exceed the current record.\n\nAnd climate attribution scientist at the Met Office, Nikos Christidis, explains how this unprecedented event is due to climate change. \n\n Climate change has already influenced the likelihood of temperature extremes in the UK. The chances of seeing 40\u00b0C days in the UK could be as much as 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence. The likelihood of exceeding 40\u00b0C anywhere in the UK in a given year has also been rapidly increasing, and, even with current pledges on emissions reductions, such extremes could be taking place every 15 years in the climate of 2100.\n\nA recent Met Office study found that summers which see days above 40\u00b0C somewhere in the UK have a return time of 100-300 years at present, even with current pledges on emissions reductions this could decrease to 15 years by 2100. \n\nUpdated at 9.06am BST\n\n\n 8.41am  \n\nMost newspaper front pages this morning feature a picture of a Queen\u2019s Guard sentry being given a sip of water outside Buckingham Palace, although the Independent has opted for a striking Met Office heatmap of Britain and the headline \u201cEarth sends a warning\u201d.\nThe prospect of an even hotter day on Tuesday provides a flurry of warnings on the front pages. \u201cRecord highs, travel chaos, schools close ... and it\u2019s going to get hotter\u201d, says the Telegraph, while the Sun warns \u201cBritain is melting\u201d.\nThe Guardian has a more politically focused headline: \u201cJohnson accused of \u2018checking out\u2019 as Britain swelters in searing heat\u201d\nYou can read the full roundup here:\n\n\nUpdated at 8.53am BST\n\n\n 8.33am  \n\nThere\u2019s more from PA Media on the UK\u2019s warmest night on record:\nUK experienced its warmest night on record on Monday as the extreme heat saw temperatures remaining in the mid-20s.It comes as a high of 40C is predicted for Tuesday, amid growing travel chaos. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has conceded the UK\u2019s transport network cannot cope with the extreme heat.\nAs the heatwave continues, Shapps told people to \u201capply common sense\u201d and \u201cdepending on the nature of your journey and reason for it, you might want to consider rearranging your day around it\u201d.He told BBC Breakfast: \n\n We\u2019ve seen a considerable amount of travel disruption. We\u2019re probably going to see the hottest day ever in the UK recorded today, and infrastructure, much of it built in Victorian times, just wasn\u2019t built to withstand this type of temperature \u2013 and it will be many years before we can replace infrastructure with the kind of infrastructure that could, because the temperatures are so extreme.\n\nAsked if the transport system can cope with the weather, Shapps said: \n\n The simple answer at the moment is no.\nWhere those tracks are 40 degrees in the air, on the ground that could be 50, 60, 70 and more, so you get a severe danger of tracks buckling. What we can\u2019t have is trains running over those and a terrible derailing.\nWe\u2019ve got to be very cautious and conscious of that, which is why there\u2019s reduced speeds on large parts of the network.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.52am BST\n\n\n 8.26am  \n\nYouGov has polled people about whether they\u2019ve changed their plans for Monday and Tuesday due to the hot weather \u2013 nearly a third say they have, rising to 39% in London, where some of the hottest temperatures will be seen, to 18% in Scotland, where it\u2019s a little cooler.\n\nThe Met Office has also asked commenters on Twitter whether they\u2019re adapting their plans \u2013 answers range from to a delivery driver exasperated with customers telling her she\u2019s lucky to have aircon in her van (she doesn\u2019t), to those who\u2019ve experimented with putting tinfoil on their windows to block out the sun, to someone who went paddle-boarding after work and another who claims to have run a half marathon in the morning \u2026\n\nOne other commenter shared this delightful image of moving their alpacas to an area with more shade:\n\nRachel Hall here taking over from Fran Lawther for the rest of the day \u2013 please do send over your stories or news from your local area to rachel.hall@theguardian.com.\n\nUpdated at 8.38am BST\n\n\n 8.12am  \nUK records hottest night ever\n\nThe UK recorded its provisionally warmest night ever from Monday into Tuesday.\nThe mercury never got below 25C in places, the Met Office said this morning. That beats the previous night-time high of 23.9C in Brighton in August 1990.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.34am BST\n\n\n 8.07am  \n\nThe ambulance service in London reported a slight increase in 999 calls for fainting and heat exposure on Monday. \nBrian Jordan, director of 999 operations for London ambulance service, told BBC Radio 4 the service received 6,600 emergency calls yesterday, slightly lower than predicted.\n\u201cWe really hope that\u2019s because the public really have been listening to the messages about how they can look after themselves and only call 999 if it\u2019s a genuine emergency,\u201d Jordan said.\n\u201cPeople have been through a very long day yesterday and there\u2019s been high temperatures overnight, and with the even hotter temperatures today I cannot really emphasise enough that people need to continue to do what we were asking them yesterday \u2013 to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, keep hydrated, look after more vulnerable friends, families, neighbours and use sun cream etc.\u201d\nFor tips on how to deal with the temperatures, my colleague Nicola Davis has this guide to keeping cool:\n\n\nUpdated at 8.09am BST\n\n\n 8.00am  \n\nThe Met Office tweeted this graphic to give details of what to expect on Tuesday:\n\n\n\n\n 7.59am  \n\nThe hot weather has sparked health warnings as there is a higher risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke, dehydration as well as breathing problems due to high pollution.\nPeople have been urged to stay inside during the hottest part of the day \u2013 between 11am and 4pm \u2013 and wear sun cream, a hat, stay in the shade and keep hydrated with water.\n\nThere were warnings about swimming in lakes, rivers and reservoirs after three people died in waters in England and a fourth was missing believed drowned.\nThere is a higher risk of wildfires, with people asked not to use barbecues or leave litter that could spark fires in the countryside \u2013 while zoos and wildlife parks were closed to protect animals, staff and visitors.\nWater companies have been experiencing \u201cunprecedented peak demand\u201d, with people encouraged to \u201ccarefully consider\u201d their water usage and urged not to waste it.\n\n\n\n 7.46am  \n\nThe UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was on Sky News this morning to say issues on the rails and roads will continue for decades during extreme heatwaves.\nAsked how long it will take to upgrade existing rail infrastructure to be more resilient, Shapps said: \u201cDecades, actually, to replace it all. Ditto with Tarmac on the roads.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long process of replacing it and upgrading it to withstand temperatures, either very hot or sometimes much colder than we\u2019ve been used to, and these are the impacts of global warming.\u201d\nHe said there was no Cobra meeting planned for Tuesday, with the prime minister instead chairing cabinet.\nBoris Johnson was accused on Monday of having \u201cchecked out\u201d, missing an emergency Cobra meeting about the searing heat. He instead attended the Farnborough airshow, where he gave a whimsical speech about completing a loop the loop and a barrel roll in a Typhoon fighter jet.\nOn Tuesday, Shapps denied Johnson was \u201cchecked out\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s literally not true, in fact exactly the opposite is the truth.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 7.50am BST\n\n\n 7.39am  \n'Unprecedented' day ahead as UK temperatures could hit 41C\n\nGood morning and welcome to our extreme weather blog.\nThe UK is bracing itself for the hottest day on record on Tuesday, as forecasters said temperatures could reach 41C.\nThe mercury is set to rise higher than on Monday \u2013 already the hottest day of the year at 38.1C (in Santon Downham, Suffolk), though slightly short of the all-time UK heat record of 38.7C. That was set in Cambridge in July 2019 but could be broken today.\nRachel Ayers, from the Met Office, told PA Media that Tuesday was going to be \u201cunprecedented\u201d. She said: \u201cThe temperature will be very hot throughout the day, before rising as high as 40C, maybe even 41C in isolated spots across England during the afternoon.\n\u201cThis will make it the hottest day on record and the first time we have seen temperatures as high as 40C.\u201d\nScotland and Wales could also have their hottest days on record. Holyrood minister Keith Brown urged people \u201cto think about whether they need to travel and, if they do, make sure they\u2019re properly equipped and plan their journey in advance\u201d.\nTravel routes will be affected by the heat and National Rail told customers only to travel if absolutely necessary. The operator said: \u201cThere will be delays, cancellations and last-minute changes to train services due to the unprecedented record heat on those days.\u201d\nThere will be no Thameslink or Great Northern trains running anywhere north of London, from London Blackfriars via St Pancras, or from London King\u2019s Cross or London Moorgate on Tuesday.\nMerseyrail said the number of trains running and journey times will be \u201cseriously affected\u201d, with some routes closed completely. LNER will run no trains from south of York and south of Leeds to London King\u2019s Cross.\nSouthern, South Eastern, South Western Railway and Great Western Railway are among the dozens of train companies running significantly reduced services across the country.\nTransport for London (TfL) said London\u2019s rail network would also be running a reduced service on Tuesday due to safety restrictions put into place to deal with the heat.\nMy name is Fran Lawther and I\u2019ll be keeping you up to date with the latest weather news, analysis and tips on how to deal with the heat.

                    "body": "\n 9.44pm  \nSummary\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of today\u2019s news, as Rishi Sunak wins the Conservative party leadership, as the only candidate after Penny Mordaunt decided not to run.\n\nRishi Sunak has become Conservative party leader, after the result of the first round of the leadership contest was announced on Monday afternoon.\nIn a speech Sunak told his party it must \u201cunite or die\u201d and in a stilted TV address he said Britain faces \u201ca profound economic challenge\u201d.\nPenny Mordaunt announced she would withdraw from the race, minutes before the 1922 committee announcement. Allies have shown evidence she was less than 10 MPs away from making the 100 MP threshold.\nSunak will meet King Charles at the palace on Tuesday where he will be asked to form a government, and become prime minister. Sunak will give a speech outside Downing Street before midday.\nLiz Truss will chair her final cabinet at 9am before going to the palace to resign.\nYouGov has released new polling suggesting that Keir Starmer is seen as likely to make the best prime minister by voters in three times as many constituencies as Sunak. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today. Thanks for following along.\n\n\n\n 9.13pm  \n\n\nDespite having no popular mandate, he did little to reassure people who are worried sick about rising costs or lengthening NHS waits. The emergency is real. Yet Mr Sunak seems intent on turning off household support for energy bills next April. He plainly thinks that meeting an arbitrary target of reducing national debt is more important than saving people from penury.\n\nRead our editorial on Sunak\u2019s incipient premiership here:\n\n\nUpdated at 9.14pm BST\n\n\n 8.04pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.19pm  \n\nGuardian sketchwriter John Crace has written this on the day\u2019s events which he\u2019s described as a \u201csecond coming for Sunak, the silent messiah\u201d.\n\nIt all panned out about as well as the Conservative party could have hoped. A new leader \u2013 the right leader, as far as MPs were concerned \u2013 elected in a matter of days. No general election. Heaven forbid. A failed state couldn\u2019t be doing with that level of democracy. Never trust the people you\u2019re intending to govern.\nNot even a parochial, controlled election of the Conservative gerontocratic membership. That really hadn\u2019t worked out so well the last time they had tried that. No. Now was the time to reduce the electorate from 180,000 down to 357 MPs. That was the way to govern the UK. Men and women who could be trusted to put the interests of themselves and their party ahead of those of the country. A higher calling than simple patriotism.\nMind you, it hadn\u2019t been entirely plain sailing. Boris Johnson had flown back from his holidays \u2013 how thoughtful of him to take a break when the rest of parliament was not on recess \u2013 to announce that he thought he had served his time in the wilderness. In his mind, a couple of months hard vacation were more than long enough punishment for criminality, serial lying and general incompetence.\nTo be fair it had also been long enough for 102 MPs. Enough to have secured the Convict a place on the ballot. That\u2019s if you trust him not to have double-counted at least 20 of his supporters. Not many people did. Most just thought he hadn\u2019t got the numbers and was trying to put the most positive spin on a failed comeback.\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n 7.05pm  \n\nThe chancellor Jeremy Hunt has congratulated Rishi Sunak on becoming prime minister.\nSunak has not yet announced whether he will keep Hunt in post, ahead of a fiscal statement that is scheduled to take place on 31 October.\nHunt tweeted: \u201cThis is a time for honesty about the huge economic challenges we face, and courage in addressing them. We have a PM who can be trusted to do just that - and give us all confidence in the huge potential of our country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 7.01pm  \n\nNew polling by YouGov has found that a majority of people believe Rishi Sunak should call an early general election.\nThe results, published hours after it was confirmed that Sunak would be the next prime minister, found 56% of people said they thought he should, against 29% who thought otherwise. \n\nYouGov also found that there were mixed feelings about Sunak taking over as prime minister \u2013 41% of people fell under the category of \u201cdisappointed\u201d against 38% of those who were \u201cpleased\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n 6.51pm  \n\nThe news that Rishi Sunak will become prime minister tomorrow when he meets the King means that Liz Truss has done her final prime minister\u2019s questions.\nThere was thought that she might have hung on until Wednesday lunchtime, to answer questions from the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, for the final time.\nOutgoing leaders have previously used final sessions at the dispatch box as a valedictory send off, from Margaret Thatcher retorting \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this\u201d in response to a quip from Dennis Skinner about whether she would become the governor of the new European Central Bank, to Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201chasta la vista, baby\u201d in July.\nInstead Truss\u2019s last time addressing the commons as prime minister will be her insisting she was a \u201cfighter, not a quitter\u201d, before standing down 24 hours later.\n\nUpdated at 6.58pm BST\n\n\n 6.36pm  \nRishi Sunak to meet King Charles on Tuesday morning before taking over as prime minister\n\nThe government has announced a timetable for Tuesday, where Rishi Sunak will travel to Buckingham Palace and meet King Charles.\nSunak will meet the monarch after Liz Truss has chaired a final meeting of her cabinet at 9am, after which she will make a speech outside Downing Street. She will then go to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the King.\nAfterwards, Sunak will go and meet the King, where he will be asked to form a government.\nThe new prime minister will then give a speech outside Number 10 at about 11.35am.\n\nUpdated at 6.41pm BST\n\n\n 6.23pm  \n\nFormer Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith has said that Boris Johnson was \u201cbegging for votes\u201d over the weekend, having returned from the Dominican Republic to try and put together a leadership campaign.\nSpeaking to Andrew Marr on LBC, he said: \u201cI think the problem when Boris came over was: one, Boris was completely unexpectedly having to do this. He made no plans. He had no team. He kind of expected I think when he arrived that there would be at least 150 people claiming him. And this would grow to the majority that didn\u2019t happen, suddenly they find themselves struggling and begging people for votes.\n\u201cThat was demeaning, really. And then when Rishi and the other said, no, the only deal we do with you is if you were serving us, not the other way around, and that cost didn\u2019t suit him.\u201d\nThis is Harry Taylor taking over from Andrew Sparrow for the rest of this evening.\n\nUpdated at 6.28pm BST\n\n\n 6.16pm  \n\nHere are tweets from two academics on the prospects of the Conservative party under Rishi Sunak.\nThis is from Prof Tim Bale, who has written several books about the modern Conservative party.\n\nAnd this is from Prof Matt Goodwin, who has written books mostly on populism and the radical right.\n\nThat\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Harry Taylor is taking over now.\n\n\n\n 6.16pm  \n\nThis is from Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, on Rishi Sunak\u2019s election as Tory leader and next PM.\n\n\n\n\n 5.59pm  \n\nMark Drakeford has also offered \u201cllongyfarchiadau\u201d (congratulations) to Rishi Sunak.\n\nDrakeford says he hopes that Rishi Sunak will work \u201cconstructively\u201d with his administration. Relations cannot be much worse than they were under Liz Truss. During the Tory leadership contest in the summer Truss said Nicola Sturgeon was an \u201cattention seeker\u201d who was best ignored, and once she became PM Truss acted her on own advice, declining to make the usual courtesy calls to the Scottish and Welsh first ministers on her appointment.\n\n\n\n 5.50pm  \n\nYouGov has released new polling suggesting that Keir Starmer is seen as likely to make the best prime minister by voters in three times as many constituencies as Rishi Sunak. Overall, 38% of respondents said Starmer would be best, while 29% said Sunak would be best. And the seat by seat figures (produced by an MRP [multilevel regression and post-stratification] analysis) suggest that Sunak was not ahead in any of the \u201cred wall\u201d Labour seats won by Boris Johnson at the last election.\n\n\n\n\n 5.39pm  \n\nAnd this is from Leo Varadkar, the Irish deputy PM. Varadkar, who was taoiseach (Irish PM) for three years, and who is due to take up the post again as part of a coalition deal, is of Indian heritage himself.\n\n\n\n\n 5.31pm  \n\nAnd the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has offered his \u201cwarmest congratulations\u201d to Rishi Sunak.\n\nSunak was born in the UK, but his parents are of Indian descent (via east Africa), and his wife is the daughter of one of India\u2019s best known, and richest, businessmen. His victory in the Tory leadership election is big news in India. The story is leading the Times of India website.\n\n\n\n\n 5.17pm  \n\nCharles Michel, president of the European Council, has sent a message of congratulations to Rishi Sunak.\n\n\n\n\n 5.15pm  \n\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said that Rishi Sunak must take the blame for the \u201cmess\u201d the economy is in. In an interview with Harrison Jones at Metro, Starmer said:\n\n[Sunak] is part of the problem. If you look at what they all said about each other over the summer, he and [Liz] Truss were slugging it out to say how awful the mess was that they created and that they should be prime minister to sort out the mess of their own making.\nSo he is absolutely covered in the mess, we have not had economic growth in the way we should have had in the last 12 years and he is a major factor in that.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.21pm BST\n\n\n 5.00pm  \n\nTheresa May has joined David Cameron, another former Tory PM, in tweeting her congratulations to Rishi Sunak.\n\nLiz Truss, the outgoing PM, has also offered her congratulations and pledged her support.\n\nSir John Major has not said anything yet \u2013 but he\u2019s not on Twitter, and when he wants to comment, he does it the old-fashioned way, via press release.\nAnd Boris Johnson has not said anything yet either. As the i\u2019s Paul Waugh suggests, perhaps Johnson took exception to the line in Sunak\u2019s speech about serving with \u201cintegrity and humility\u201d. (See 4.18pm.)\n\n\n\n\n 4.52pm  \n\nDouglas Ross, the embattled Scottish Conservative leader, has congratulated Rishi Sunak on securing the leadership of the UK party, even as his own tenure is under increasing threat.\nRoss said he looked forward to working with Sunak \u201cfor the good of Scotland and for the whole of the United Kingdom\u201d in a short statement on Twitter, adding: \u201cAs he showed during his time as chancellor \u2013 not least in safeguarding one in three Scottish jobs during the pandemic through the furlough scheme \u2013 Rishi Sunak is uniquely well equipped for that task.\u201d\n\nDuring the last leadership contest Ross did not formally back a candidate but appeared alongside Liz Truss on visits the day she and Sunak jousted at the Scottish leadership hustings in Perth. After her election as UK leader, there were a series of senior departures from Ross\u2019s backroom team at Holyrood, and a humiliating misstep over a job applicant\u2019s inaccurate CV, sharpening internal anxieties about his leadership.\nSince the economic crisis and the collapse in Tory support triggered by Truss\u2019s mini-budget \u2013 a collapse that could result in the the Tories being wiped out in Scotland \u2013 Ross urged the party to rally around her, later insisting he was duty bound to support her.\nWith that, following his swithering and equivocation on Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, his internal critics in the Scottish party are plotting vigorously against him, although no clear challenger has yet emerged. The Times reported one Tory MSP saying in late September: \u201cCutlasses are being sharpened.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.55pm BST\n\n\n 4.48pm  \n\nSamuel Kasumu, the former race adviser to Boris Johnson who is standing to be the Conservative candidate for the mayoralty of London, said Rishi Sunak\u2019s win as the first British Asian prime minister was a \u201chistoric\u201d moment, and offered his full support.\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually the second minority ethnic Conservative prime minister after one of my heroes, Benjamin Disraeli,\u201d Kasumu said, referring to Britain\u2019s first and only prime minister of Jewish heritage to date, who came to office in 1868. Kasumu went on:\n\nThere is no doubt that this is still a historic day for Britain. The country needs him to succeed, and he has my full support.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.50pm BST\n\n\n 4.44pm  \n\nCommenting on Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech (see 4.18am), the Lib Dem Treasury spokeperson, Sarah Olney, said:\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s statement will do nothing to reassure people worried sick about their bills and local health services this winter.\nHe said nothing about his plans for the country, leaving the public in the dark while he celebrates behind closed doors with Conservative MPs.\nThey have installed someone in No 10 who nobody voted for, is totally out of touch with struggling families and pensioners, and can\u2019t even tell us what he\u2019ll do next.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.51pm BST\n\n\n 4.39pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 4.29pm  \n\nIt looks as if Matt Hancock won\u2019t need to spend tomorrow waiting by his phone, judging by this clip of Rishi Sunak welcoming supporters outside CCHQ. Sunak goes from Mel Stride to Jake Berry, the Tory chair, ignoring the former health secretary.\n\n\n\n\n 4.18pm  \nSunak promises to serve 'with integrity and humility' as he says UK faces 'profound economic challenge'\n\nRishi Sunak starts by paying tribute to Liz Truss for her leadership, saying she served \u201cunder exceptionally difficult circumstances\u201d.\nHe is humbled to have been elected leader of the Conservative and Unionist party, he says. It is the greatest privilege of his life \u201cto be able to serve the party I love and give back to the country I owe so much to\u201d, he says. He goes on:\n\nBut there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge. We now need stability and unity. And I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together. Because that is the only way we will overcome the challenges we face and build a better, more prosperous future for our children and our grandchildren.\nI pledge that I will serve you with integrity and humility, and I will work day in, day out, to deliver for the British people.\n\nThat barely counted as a speech. Sunak\u2019s delivery was wooden, and the content did not really rise above cliche. But his tribute to Truss was generous, and his reference to \u201cintegrity and humility\u201d suggests that he is keen to show that he marks a departure from Boris Johnson, as well as from Truss. (Humility was not a feature of her premiership, until the end, although her integrity was not generally questioned.)\n\nUpdated at 5.01pm BST\n\n\n 4.05pm  \nSunak to give first public comments since becoming Tory leader and next PM\n\nRishi Sunak is about to give a speech on camera at Tory HQ. These will be his first public comments, not just since becoming prime minister designate (he won\u2019t take over until tomorrow at the earliest) but since Liz Truss resigned. He got elected Tory leader this time without making any public speeches, or giving any interviews, at all.\nIn normal circumstances that would be a democratic outrage, but the process was truncated, and Sunak and his policy agenda were subject to extensive coverage during the last Tory leadership contest in the summer.\nOf course, quite a lot has changed since then. It would have been good to have heard him discuss the mini-budget, and the economic crisis it provoked.\nAll we got was this message.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.19pm BST\n\n\n 3.58pm  \nSunak will not take over as PM today, No 10 says\n\nAt the afternoon lobby briefing, Downing Street said the handover of power from Liz Truss to Rishi Sunak would not happen today. It is expected to happen tomorrow, although the PM\u2019s spokesperson would not even confirm that.\n\nUpdated at 4.02pm BST\n\n\n 3.57pm  \nWhat Sunak told Tory MPs in his first speech to them as Tory leader\n\nSimon Hoare, a long-time Rishi Sunak supporter, has given more details of Sunak\u2019s speech to Tory MPs where he told them the party faced \u201can existential threat\u201d. (See 3.37pm.)\n\u201c[Sunak] said we could not pretend the last few weeks and months had been easy or edifying or helpful,\u201d said Hoarer. He went on:\n\nWe are going back to serious, pragmatic traditions of Conservative government. The message we heard was about going forward \u2013 as a party and a government this is about the future and shaping the future. We cannot rewrite history. We will play the hand we have got, but it is not an inevitable threat we face.\n\nSunak told MPs his ambition was to have a \u201chighly productive UK economy\u201d, stressing a commitment to levelling up and the pledges of the 2019 manifesto. He said the party backed \u201clow taxation\u201d but said it had to be affordable and deliverable.\nHe said a stable and productive economy would be the engine that drove a well-funded health and education service, as well as delivering on net zero carbon emissions and said it would be an \u201cenvironmentally focused government\u201d.\nSunak said there would be \u201cno early election\u201d though he said opposition parties would inevitably clamour for one. He said he would ask the British people for space and time to resolve the problems the country is facing.\nThere was no commitment to spending cuts, but Sunak said it would be a \u201ctough period\u201d for the government. Stressing a need for stability, MPs said they inferred that Sunak would ask Jeremy Hunt to stay on as chancellor. \u201cTime is not on our side, we have no time to lose,\u201d Hoare said.\nIain Duncan Smith, a prominent backer of both Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, said it was right that a decision had been made quickly. He said:\n\nThere is no more messing around, it is time to end the psychodrama and get on with governing. He [Sunak] said it was time to end personality politics. He knows now we have to deliver what we promise. His first priority is to stabilise the economy and get that moving, then all the other things we promise to do, make the most of Brexit, levelling up in left-behind areas.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.04pm BST\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\nThe former prime minister Theresa May said Rishi Sunak has her \u201cfull support\u201d.\nIn a tweet which might be taken as an implicit criticism of the alternative scenario \u2013 in which Boris Johnson was back at Downing Street \u2013 she adding that Sunak will provide the \u201ccalm, competent, pragmatic leadership\u201d the UK needs.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.50pm BST\n\n\n 3.44pm  \n\nAction for Children, a charity that protects and supports vulnerable children and young people, has urged Rishi Sunak to prioritise the 3.9 million children living in poverty in the UK.\nThe charity added:\n\nThe simplest way to do this is for the prime minister to stand by his promise earlier this year, to keep benefits in line with inflation.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.50pm BST\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\nRishi Sunak has just arrived at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ), where he was filmed hugging and shaking hands with Conservative officials and MPs waiting for him.\nHe was greeted with cheers and applause, but went inside without making any public comments. We\u2019re still waiting for him to say anything in public despite now being the prime minister in waiting.\nHowever, a lectern has been erected inside CCHQ, so we\u2019re expecting him to speak shortly.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.50pm BST\n\n\n 3.37pm  \nSunak: Conservative party faces 'existential threat'\n\nSunak warned MPs in that meeting a little earlier that the Conservative party was facing an \u201cexistential threat,\u201d according to the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.39pm BST\n\n\n 3.31pm  \nSunak rule out early election - reports\n\nRishi Sunak has told Conservative MPs that there will not be an early general election.\nThe new Tory leader addressed MPs in the Commons after the 1922 Committee announced he was the only candidate in a condensed leadership contest.\nWe\u2019re now waiting for Sunak to appear in public as Tory activists and MPs are gathering outside of Conservative Party Central Office.\n\n\n\n\n 3.25pm  \n\nBroadcast interviews have been halted by security inside Westminster\u2019s central lobby after a sit-in protest by Greenpeace UK activists took place.\nThe group said that more than 30 activists had occupied parliament. It added on Twitter: \u201cWhile the government is in chaos, almost 7 million people are facing fuel poverty.\u201d\n\u201cWe need the next government to deliver a proper windfall tax to insulate homes and keep people warm this winter.\u201d\n\nGreepeace said campaigners from Greenpeace and Fuel Poverty Action entered the Palace of Westminster as tourists and visitors and were occupying the central lobby, linking arms, reading testimonies from people struggling with bills and unfurled a banner reading \u201cchaos costs lives\u201d.\nGreenpeace UK\u2019s co-executive director, Will McCallum, said:\n\nRishi Sunak should have realised by now the huge mistake he made by blocking plans for warmer homes and failing to properly tax fossil fuel giants. People need permanently lower bills and a safe climate, and that means more renewable energy, more financial support, a nationwide street-by-street insulation programme, and a proper tax on the energy profiteers to pay for it.\n\nRuth London, from Fuel Poverty Action, called for support for their \u201cenergy for all\u201d proposal, giving each household enough free energy to cover basics such as heating, cooking and lighting, paid for windfall taxes, ending fossil fuel subsidies and higher prices for excess energy use.\nHere\u2019s the moment when the protestors took up their positions\n\n\nUpdated at 3.50pm BST\n\n\n 3.12pm  \n\nThe Green party has added its voice to those calls for a general election, which is now coming from sources ranging from the Labour party through to former Tory minister Nadine Dorries.\nGreen party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said:\n\nThe country cannot afford more divisive infighting amongst a few elitist Conservatives whose policies are failing people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.\nEven Conservative party MPs and members have been excluded from the vote this time.\nPeople need to be democratically involved in finding solutions. This must include a general election, and the opportunity to elect more Greens committed to a more equal society and solving the environmental crisis.\n\nElection calls were coming from the right as well, with the leader of the Reform party UK, Richard Tice, seeking to capitalise on discontent among Conservative party members aggrieved at missing out on a chance to vote for their leader.\n\u201cWe have a prime minister appointed by acclamation. His party members rejected him. Democracy is in peril,\u201d he claimed.\n\nUpdated at 3.13pm BST\n\n\n 3.05pm  \nLabour accuses Sunak of 'dodging scrutiny' amid renewed election calls\n\nRishi Sunak has been accused by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, of \u201cdodging scrutiny\u201d as she reiterated Labour\u2019s calls for a general election after the former chancellor was officially declared the new Conservative leader on Monday.\nShe said :\n\nThe Tories have crowned Rishi Sunak as prime minister without him saying a single word about how he would run the country, and without anyone having the chance to vote.\nThis is the same Rishi Sunak who as chancellor failed to grow the economy, failed to get a grip on inflation, and failed to help families with the Tory cost of living crisis. And it\u2019s the same Rishi Sunak whose family avoided paying tax in this country before he put up taxes on everyone else.\n\u201cWith his record - and after Liz Truss comprehensively beat him over the summer - it\u2019s no wonder he is dodging scrutiny. Rishi Sunak has no mandate and no idea what working people need. We need a general election so the public get a say on the future of Britain \u2013 and the chance for a fresh start with Labour.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.14pm BST\n\n\n 3.01pm  \n\nThere has been relief, from a cybersecurity perspective, that a leadership election at short notice involving thousands of Conservative party members has been avoided.\nCiaran Martin, a former head of Britain\u2019s Nation Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said: \u201cWe must realise that political parties are tiny organisations, akin to charities. They are not governments. They\u2019re not geared up to hold votes on which so much depends, especially online, especially at a week\u2019s notice.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be worth both major parties &amp; others working with the relevant experts in government elsewhere to prepare for future contests. We\u2019ve had more than half a decade of concerns about electoral interference and for me the fundamental challenge is that whilst political parties are powerful, their organisational capacity is tiny compared with a government or large company,\u201d added Martin, a professor of practice at the Blavatnik school of government at Oxford University.\nExperts had warned hackers from rogue states could attempt to discredit the Conservative leadership contest with spurious claims about the integrity of an online members\u2019 vote.\nIf there were two candidates remaining in the race after Monday, Tory party members would have taken part in an online vote to decide the new prime minister.\nThe NCSC, an arm of the GCHQ spy agency, contacted the Conservative party over its leadership voting preparations last week, having also intervened before the previous leader ballot.\nThat August intervention resulted in the party enhancing security around the voting process, but it is understood that NCSC did not advised changes to the voting system this time.\nJamie Collier, a consultant at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said last week: \u201cThere could be an attempt at sowing disinformation after the vote.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 3.03pm BST\n\n\n 2.50pm  \n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has congratulated Rishi Sunak on becoming PM \u2013 and called for an early general election.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.51pm BST\n\n\n 2.48pm  \nSunak urges Tories to unite at private meeting with MPs after his election as new leader\n\nRishi Sunak did not spend long speaking to Tory MPs. He was addressing them in private, and he did not speak to reporters as he went in, or as he came out. Here are tweets from some of the reporters doorstepping the room.\nFrom Sky\u2019s Jon Craig\n\n\n\nFrom ITV\u2019s Anushka Asthana\n\n\nFrom my colleague Jessica Elgot\n\n\n\n\n 2.41pm  \n\nThree days ago Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, said it was \u201cBoris or bust\u201d.\n\nHe has not deleted that tweet, but he has congratulated Rishi Sunak and offered his support.\n\n\n\n\n 2.39pm  \n\nJake Berry, the Conservative party chair, has put out this statement about Rishi Sunak\u2019s election as Tory leader.\n\nI\u2019d like to congratulate Rishi Sunak on becoming the new leader of our party. Now is the time for the whole party to come together and unite four-square behind Rishi, as he gets on with the vital work of tackling the challenges we face as a country. The time for internal debates is well and truly over, and led by Rishi Sunak, I know we can and will deliver on the priorities of the British people.\n\n\n\n\n 2.35pm  \nSunak's appointment as PM 'hopeful sign of progress against prejudices of past', says thinktank\n\nSunder Katwala, who runs the British Future thinktank, which focuses on issues relating to immigration, identity and race, says Rishi Sunak\u2019s appoinment as PM is a historic moment. He says:\n\nRishi Sunak becoming the first British Indian prime minister is an historic moment. This simply would not have been possible even a decade or two ago.\nIt shows that public service in the highest office in Britain can be open to those of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds. This will be a source of pride to many British Asians - including many who do not share Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservative politics.\nMost people in Britain now rightly say the ethnicity and faith of the prime minister should not matter. They will judge Sunak on whether he can get a grip on the chaos in Westminster, sort out the public finances, and restore integrity to politics.\nBut we should not underestimate this important social change. When Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980, there had been no Asian or black MPs at all in the postwar era. There were still no black or Asian Conservative MPs when he graduated from university in 2001.\nSunak reaching 10 Downing Street does not make Britain a perfect meritocracy. While there is more to do, this is a hopeful sign of progress against the prejudices of the past. National politics has set the pace and business, public services and charities should accept the challenge to reflect modern Britain too.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.41pm BST\n\n\n 2.35pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 2.28pm  \n\nPenny Mordaunt is addressing Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee.

I thought she would be dull and geeky and workmanlike, and it would be an antidote to Johnson. I did genuinely think she was better placed to unite the party than Rishi \u2013 obviously there was a big group of people at that stage who were hostile to him \u2013 but none of those things happened.One: she poured a bucket of petrol over everything; two, she made absolutely no effort to work with the parliamentary party.\n\nAsked if he had regrets about backing Truss, he said:\n\nMy view is [Truss\u2019s term in office] didn\u2019t work out as I anticipated that it would. What we\u2019ve to do now is move forward. We\u2019ve got to stabilise the situation. Rishi Sunak is best placed to do that in the interests of the country. I hope he will bring the professionalism to the office necessary to carry it out.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.56pm BST\n\n\n 12.33pm  \nTory ERG declines to endorse either Sunak or Mordaunt, but says both promised to take 'very robust' line on NI protocol\n\nThe European Research Group, which represents strongly pro-Brexit Tories, has been meeting today to discuss whether to endorse Rishi Sunak or Penny Mordaunt for the leadership. The ERG was a very powerful caucus in Tory circles in the Brexit year, and its backing for Boris Johnson in 2019 was a major boost to his campaign. If Brexiter MPs had united behind an alternative candidate, Johnson may never have reached the ballot for party members.\nBut the ERG is a much less influential group now, because its members have split on issues such as Liz Truss\u2019s leadership, and whether Boris Johnson should return. At a briefing this morning Mark Francois, its chair, told reporters it was endorsing neither Sunak nor Mordaunt.\nBut Francois said Sunak and Mordaunt had both assured a delegation from the ERG when they met this morning that they were committed to the Northern Ireland protocol \u2013 and to, if necessary, using the Parliament Act to push it through the House of Lords.\nHere are the key lines from Francois\u2019s briefing.\n\nFrancois said the ERG thought the party had \u201cone, and potentially two, extremely strong options to be leader of the Conserative party\u201d. But he said the group could not agree collectively to endorse either candidate. He did not say whether Sunak or Mordaunt was the candidate they considered only \u201cpotentially\u201d strong.\n\n\nHe said the ERG had been assured by Sunak and Mordaunt that they were both committed to taking a \u201cvery robust\u201d line on the Northern Ireland protocol. He said:\n\n\nSome of us having spoken to both potential candidates this morning, they were equally adamant that they would take, if they became prime minister, a very robust line on the Northern Ireland protocol, up to and including, if necessary, utilising the Parliament Act to ensure that the Northern Ireland protocol bill reaches the statute book.\n\n\nHe said Sunak and Mordaunt also both told the ERG that they wanted to lead a united party, and that their government appointments would reflect that.\n\n\nSunak did not give the ERG a firm commitment to increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP, Francois said. He said Mordaunt did say that getting defence spending to 3% of GDP was her aim, but that it would only happen when economic conditions allowed.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.58pm BST\n\n\n 12.09pm  \n\nAnd Chris Heaton-Harries, the Northern Ireland secretary, is backing Rishi Sunak too. He was a leading Boris Johnson supporter, and only yesterday he was messaging Johnson supporters to say that Johnson would be on the ballot today.\n\n\n\n\n 12.05pm  \n\nBrandon Lewis, the justice secretary, has endorsed Rishi Sunak for the Tory leadership.\n\n\n\n\n 11.54am  \nMore than half Tory MPs now backing Sunak for party leader and next PM\n\nRishi Sunak has secured public declarations of more than half of Conservative MPs ahead of today\u2019s 2pm deadline for nominations.\nAccording to the Guardian\u2019s count of public endorsements, as of 11.30am Rishi Sunak had the backing of 182 MPs, equivalent to 51% of the total number of Conservatives with seats in parliament.\nA dozen of those who had previously backed Boris Johnson have now publicly switched allegiance to Sunak, including current or former cabinet ministers James Cleverly, Nadhim Zahawi and Priti Patel.\nJust two Johnson supporters have switched to Penny Mordaunt: Michael Fabricant and Giles Watling, bringing her known total to 27, although her camp are claiming that she has more than 90 backers including those who have not declared publicly.\n\nUpdated at 12.03pm BST\n\n\n 11.48am  \nMordaunt campaign source claims she has 90 endorsements - despite only around 30 backing her publicly\n\nThe Penny Mordaunt campaign is claiming that she now has endorsements from 90 Tory MPs. A campaign source told journalists:\n\nWe have now passed 90. For the sake of the party, it\u2019s important our members have their say.\n\nIf Mordaunt has got 90 endorsements, that would around three times as many private endorsements as the number of public endorsements she has got. It is possible that the campaign is exaggerating in the hope of getting more supporters to back her by 2pm, the deadline when nominations close. It is possible that 90 Tories have given Mordaunt some sort of commitment \u2013 perhaps conditional on something, or perhaps commitments that they will not honour. (Nominations are done privately, and so an MP can tell a candidate they will nominate them, but then \u2018forget\u2019 to sign the paperwork.) Or it is possible that Mordaunt does have 90 bona fide nominations.\nBut some MPs are sceptical. This is from the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman.\n\n\n\n\n 11.37am  \nMordaunt supporter George Freeman suggests it might be best for Tory MPs to rally behind Sunak\n\nThe FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne reckons Penny Mordaunt\u2019s supporters are divided over whether she should concede, and pull out of the contest today.\n\nAs evidence, Payne cites these tweets from George Freeman, the science minister. Freeman has been a Mordaunt supporter. But now he is suggesting that it might be better for MPs to unite behind Rishi Sunak to avoid the need for a ballot of party members.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.52am BST\n\n\n 11.19am  \n\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, held a phone-in on LBC this morning. Here are the main points.\n\nStarmer said he put his head in his hands when he heard Boris Johnson wanted to return as PM. He said:\n\n\nWhen [Johnson] first said that he was going to run, and everybody was sort of rallying around, I did put my head in my hands and think, so, really, we\u2019re going to go from the prime minister who\u2019s just crashed the economy ... back to the guy that only ... months ago, most of us were saying was unfit for office. It was never going to work, I don\u2019t think.\n\n\nStarmer said that there was \u201cnot a great deal\u201d between Labour and the Tories in their support for a points-based immigration policy. Labour would scrap the Rwanda scheme, under which people arriving in the UK seeking asylum can be sent to Rwanda, Starmer said. But on immigration generally he said:\n\n\nNow we don\u2019t have free movement any more, then you either have a pure numbers game or you have a points-based system that says: \u2018Well, for certain types of jobs, certain types of roles here, you would get a number of points\u2019. I think that makes sense.\nSo, in that sense, not a great deal between the major parties on immigration.\nWe would have a slightly different approach and I would particularly want to welcome really good students. I feel that over the years we\u2019ve put good students off coming here and many of them have ended up going to Australia and Canada and the US. I would want to see the best possible students coming to this country to study.\n\n\nHe said Labour would not grant new oil and gas licences. \u201cWe accept there\u2019s got to be a transition, so where there is oil and gas already being yielded that needs to continue as part of the transition, but no new sites, no new fields to be opened,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHe said Labour would not rejoin the EU under his leadership. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back into the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a position of my party, that isn\u2019t what an incoming Labour government would do.\u201d\n\n\nHe said he and other Labour figures will not attend the World Cup in Qatar because of its human rights record.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.35am BST\n\n\n 11.03am  \n\nKemi Badenoch, the international trade secretary, and Sir Gavin Williamson, the former education secretary, were among senior Tories who visited Rishi Sunak\u2019s campaign HQ this morning, PA Media reports.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.35am BST\n\n\n 10.55am  \n\nRuth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has backed Rishi Sunak in the latest Tory leadership race, arguing that \u201ca return to moderate, grown up, honest, stable government cannot come soon enough\u201d.\nDavidson, now a Conservative peer and a prominent critic of Boris Johnson, was the most successful Scottish Tory leader in the devolution era, leading the party to second place at Holyrood in 2016 and its best post-devolution performance in council elections in 2017.\nIn an implicit attack on the Liz Truss era and on those in the party who backed Truss\u2019s leadership bid in August, Davidson said:\n\nI backed Rishi in the summer and continue to believe he\u2019s the best person for the job.\nThe challenges facing the country are significant, but the government has a duty to meet those challenges head on \u2013 to level with the country as to why and to what end decisions are being taken. There are so many people struggling and worried out there. Frankly, a return to moderate, grown up, honest, stable government cannot come soon enough.\n\nThe Scottish party is now in disarray following the repeated crises at Westminster under Johnson\u2019s and Truss\u2019s leadership; Davidson\u2019s successor, Douglas Ross, flip-flopped about Johnson\u2019s future as PM several times and then appeared to endorse Truss in August. He now faces potential leadership challenges, and has yet to state any preference in the current contest.\n\nUpdated at 11.37am BST\n\n\n 10.33am  \nLevelling up secretary Simon Clarke backs Sunak for PM, despite criticising his 'Labour-lite economic policy' over summer\n\nSimon Clarke, the levelling up secretary, has become the latest person who was supporting Boris Johnson to endorse Rishi Sunak for the Tory leadership.\n\n<!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field -->\n\n\nClarke is one of the most significant of the Johnsonite switchers. He was one of the leading figures in the Liz Truss campaign during the summer and, in that capacity, he often criticised Sunak aggressively in public. For example, after one debate he accused Sunak of being \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d towards Truss. And he co-authored a Telegraph article accusing Sunak of policy U-turns, resisting attempts to cut EU red tape and favouring \u201ca Labour-lite economic policy\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 11.42am BST\n\n\n 10.16am  \n\nFrom LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood\n\n\n\n\n 10.16am  \nUK stocks up and cost of government borrowing falls as Sunak poised to become PM\n\nThe stock market is up this morning, and government borrowing costs are down, following the news that Boris Johnson is not contesting the Tory leadership contest, and Rishi Sunak is now the overwhelming favourite to become the next PM. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has more on the business live blog.\n\n\n\n\n 10.11am  \nMordaunt's campaign claims she is 'getting the numbers' to be on ballot for Tory leadership\n\nThe Penny Mordaunt campaign says the leader of the Commons is \u201cgetting the numbers\u201d to be able to be on the ballot for the Tory leadership. She needs to be nominated by 100 Tories. So far only around 30 of them have publicly backed her. But a campaign spokesperson told journalists this morning;\n\nPenny is speaking to colleagues from across the party. She\u2019s getting the numbers and she\u2019s in it to win it.\nPenny has always been a campaigner - she took her seat from Labour and she\u2019s fought for it ever since. The party needs a fresh start to ensure it wins the next general election and holds the seats it gained in 2019.\n\n\u201cGetting the numbers\u201d is not the same has \u2018\u201chas got the numbers\u201d, suggesting that the briefing to Paul Brand earlier (see 9.33am) may have gone too far.\n\nUpdated at 10.20am BST\n\n\n 9.57am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.56am  \n\nJeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has used an article in the Daily Telegraph to explain why he is backing Rishi Sunak for PM. Hunt says:\n\nOur public finances, market credibility and international reputation have taken a serious blow. To restore stability and confidence, we need a leader who can be trusted to make difficult choices. We also need someone who can explain those choices to members of the public who are worried about jobs, mortgages and public services.\nWe have a leader who can do just that in Rishi Sunak. \n\nSunak is expected to keep Hunt at the Treasury if he becomes PM.\n\n\n\n 9.33am  \n\nThe Conservative MP Andrew Stephenson has joined the flow of Boris Johnson supporters switching to Rishi Sunak.\n\nThere is little evidence of Johnson supporters backing Penny Mordaunt, although ITV\u2019s Paul Brand says Penny Mordaunt\u2019s team are privately claiming to have 100 MP endorsements \u2013 the number needed to get her on the ballot paper.\n\nAccording to the Guido Fawkes spreadsheet, Mordaunt has just 31 declared supporters.\n\nUpdated at 9.35am BST\n\n\n 9.26am  \n\nReaders have pointed out that Benjamin Disraeli, who was Jewish, was the first minority ethnic prime minister. I\u2019ve corrected the post at 8.02am to say Rishi Sunak would be the first person of colour to be PM.\nUPDATE: It would be more accurate to say Disraeli was of Jewish heritage, using today\u2019s terminology. His family was Jewish, but he was baptised into the Church of England.\n\nUpdated at 10.05am BST\n\n\n 9.11am  \n\nGrant Shapps, the home secretary and leading Rishi Sunak supporter, was doing interviews this morning on behalf of the former chancellor and runaway favourite for next PM. Here are some of the points he made.\n\nShapps said Sunak did not consider victory \u201cin the bag\u201d. He said:\n\n\nRishi doesn\u2019t think that it\u2019s in the bag. He\u2019s speaking to colleagues this morning, he\u2019s working very hard to attract those supporters who were perhaps with Boris Johnson previously.\n\n\nShapps declined to say that Penny Mordaunt should withdraw from the contest. Asked if she should, he said:\n\n\nThat\u2019s up to Penny Mordaunt and her supporters. What I do know is that Rishi enjoys the support of a large number of Conservative MPs, and there\u2019s a very high nomination threshold of 100.\n\n\nHe claimed that Sunak would have a mandate from the 2019 general election. He said:\n\n\nWe elect a party and we elect individuals as members of that party, and the 2019 manifesto is actually the thing - the document, if you like - that Rishi is standing on.\n\n\nHe rejected suggestions that Suella Braverman is backing Sunak because Sunak has promised her she can return to her old job as home secretary, which Shapps now has. When this was put to Shapps half-jokingly, he said he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d Sunak had not made that promise to Braverman. Sunak wanted a \u201cfree hand\u201d to \u201cbuild a team of the best people\u201d, Shapps said.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.16am BST\n\n\n 9.02am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 8.59am  \n\nMichael Gove, the former levelling up secretary, has also urged the Tories to unite behind Rishi Sunak. That is no surprise because he backed Sunak in the summer, after Kemi Badenoch, his first choice for leader, was knocked out of the contest.\n\n\n\n\n 8.55am  \nFormer Johnson supporter Priti Patel backs Sunak for Tory leader\n\nPriti Patel, the former home secretary, has become the latest Tory to switch from backing Boris Johnson for the leadership to supporting Rishi Sunak.\n\n\n\n\n 8.50am  \n\nAndrea Leadsom, the Tory former cabinet minister and a leading Penny Mordaunt supporter, told Sky News there was \u201cno prospect\u201d of an early general election under Mordaunt because she would have a mandate from the 2019 election.\n\nThere is no prospect of an early general election under a Penny Mordaunt leadership. You know, we have a mandate from 2019 from the people to fulfil the promises that we made to them then.\n\nIn her memoir Snakes and Ladders Leadsom said she and Mordaunt used to have \u201ca longstanding agreement \u2013 only slightly tongue in cheek \u2013 from our days as backbenchers that we would have senior roles in each other\u2019s administrations should either of us ever become prime minister\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 9.06am BST\n\n\n 8.38am  \nChristopher Chope joins other Johnson supporters in calling for general election\n\nSir Christopher Chope, a Conservative MP who wanted Boris Johnson to replace Liz Truss, told the Today programme this morning that he thought the next prime minister should call a general election to get a mandate. He said:\n\nIf people who are now seeking the crown want to have the respect which comes from having a mandate, then what I\u2019m saying is that the best way they can get that respect is by winning a mandate with the people, and that\u2019s why I think a general election is essentially the only answer, otherwise we\u2019re just going to go from bad to worse.\nThe party is ungovernable in the House of Commons and so we\u2019re going to have continuing rebellions as we try to change policies and so on, and so I must say I\u2019m very pessimistic, I\u2019m very angry, and I feel that Boris has been let down once again and undermined by our parliamentary colleagues.\n\nMost Conservative MPs dread an early general election, because polling suggests they would lose by a landslide. The latest Politico poll of polls gives Labour a 34-point lead. Electoral Calculus, which uses figures giving Labour a 27-point lead, estimates that an election now would lead to Labour winning 507 seats, and the Conservatives getting just 48.\nBut Chope is not alone, and other Tories \u2013 particularly Johnson supporters \u2013 have been making the same point. Last night Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, said she thought a general election was inevitable.\n\nZac Goldsmith, the Foreign Office minister, made the same point yesterday.\n\nAnd in his Sunday Telegraph column the Tory peer Daniel Hannan (who worked with Johnson at the Telegraph, and was given a peerage by him) claimed that an early election could even benefit the Tories. He said:\n\nThe constitutional case is that circumstances have changed: neither the pandemic nor the war had happened in 2019, manifestos have been overtaken by events, and there is a need for fresh mandates.\nThe tactical case is that a Labour government elected now is more likely to be short-lived than one elected in two years\u2019 time when the Tories have carried out arduous and unpopular repair-work, and when the economy is recovering.\nIt is even possible that, if the choice is put starkly enough, the Tories might win.\n\nIn his statement yesterday anouncing he would not be a candidate Johnson himself claimed he was \u201cuniquely placed to avert a general election now\u201d, implying that another PM would find it hard to avoid calls to hold one.\nAlmost all opposition parties are demanding an early election, and a public petition calling for one has now attracted more than 865,000 signatures.\n\nUpdated at 8.53am BST\n\n\n 8.07am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 8.06am  \n\nIf Rishi Sunak is named as the new prime minister later today, he will become the UK\u2019s first Hindu premier - and will take up the position on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\nSunak is a practising Hindu, although he has rarely talked about his faith in public.\nTwo years ago, when chancellor, he lit candles to mark Diwali on the doorstep of No 11 Downing St at a time when Covid restrictions remained in force. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get through this. And it\u2019s going to be so much better on the other side.\u201d\nDiwali is a five day festival celebrated by millions of Hindus, Sikhs and Jains across the world. It is a festival of new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness.\nThis year Diwali takes place from 22 October to 26 October, with the main day of celebration being today.\nLights and candles will be lit on streets and people\u2019s houses, and fireworks will mark the festival. Families will visit relatives for celebratory feasts.\n\n\n\n 8.02am  \n\nGood morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Helen Sullivan, on a morning when the UK wakes up to learn that one national icon is staging a comeback, but it\u2019s David Tennant as Dr Who (see 6.44am), not Boris Johnson as prime minister. News does not always have to be depressing.\nAnd it looks very, very likely that by the end of the day Rishi Sunak will be the next prime minister. New prime ministers seem to come along quite regularly now, but this will be a more historic handover than the last. If he does become PM, Sunak will be the first person of colour to hold the post. It will be the first time since 1940 that a new PM has taken over for the second time since the previous general election. And it will be the first time since 1834 that the we\u2019ve had three prime ministers in year.\nSunak may also become PM despite have said almost nothing in public about how he intends to govern \u2013 although, since he was a candidate in the summer, we do have a policy platform that he set out recently.\nWe will know soon after 2pm whether or not that is the outcome. That is the time when nominations close and Penny Mordaunt, the only other candidate still in the contest, is struggling to collect 100 names. Since Boris Johnson pulled out of the contest last night, we\u2019ve seen more of his supporters back Sunak than Mordaunt.\nWe don\u2019t have timings yet, but if Mordaunt fails to get the 100 nominations, or pulls out, then it is possible that Sunak could have an audience with the King later this afternoon to be asked to form a government. He could be doing a speech from No 10 before nightfall.\nIf Mordaunt does get 100 nominations, there will be a hustings for Tory MPs at 2.30pm, and then they will have an \u201cindicative vote\u201d. This is so that members will know how much support each candidate has amongst MPs. The person coming second (almost certainly Mordaunt) would be under pressure to withdraw at that point, although theoretically the decision could still go to a ballot of members, in which case we would not have a new PM until Friday.\n\nUpdated at 9.34am BST\n\n\n 7.33am  \n\nThat\u2019s it for me, Helen Sullivan, for today \u2013 thanks for following along. Andrew Sparrow will take the helm for the next while, so stay tuned. \n\n\n\n 7.31am  \n\nThe shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, has just said on BBC Radio 4 that the Conservatives, \u201ccrash the economy and then they say that they have the solution and they won\u2019t let anybody else have a say\u201d.\nShe has called for a general election, saying that had there been one when Boris Johnson resigned, the recent economic turmoil would have been avoided.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting that we\u2019re now talking about austerity version 2 after the Conservatives crashed the budget when we weren\u2019t talking about it at all in the summer?\u201d she asked, pointing out that the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast has been held back until after a new PM is chosen.\n\nUpdated at 7.34am BST\n\n\n 7.26am  \n\nGuy Hands, a long-time Conservative supporter and the founder of the investment firm Terra Firma, has told BBC Radio 4 listeners that the UK economy is \u201cfrankly doomed\u201d.\nHe warned that Britons will face steadily increasing taxes, steadily decreasing social services, higher interest rates and the need for a \u201cbailout from the IMF\u201d in the long term if the next Tory leader doesn\u2019t renegotiate the Brexit deal.\nHe said that Britain was on track to become the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 7.33am BST\n\n\n 7.18am  \nDamian Green 'confident' Mordaunt will reach nominations threshold\n\nOn BBC Radio 4, Conservative MP for Ashford, Damian Green, who is supporting Penny Mordaunt, has just said that today is a \u201cday to look forward\u201d.\nHe says he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d Mordaunt will get the needed number of nominations and that \u201cPenny\u2019s numbers, I know, are well above the published figures\u201d. He refused to name the number, however.\n\u201cPenny is the person best positioned to unify the party,\u201d he said.\nAsked if Johnson would come back in 2024, Green said, he \u201cdesperately hopes\u201d Mordaunt will win today or in the course of this week.\n\nUpdated at 7.31am BST\n\n\n 7.14am  \n\nIf you\u2019re just joining us, here is a reminder of where things stand:\n\nFormer prime minister Boris Johnson has ended his bid to return to power within months of being ousted, claiming that although he had the numbers, he would not run to replace Liz Truss, who resigned as Conservative party leader on Thursday after just 45 days in office. Johnson claimed to have won the support of 102 colleagues \u2013 two clear of the threshold needed \u2013 but only about 60 had publicly stated their support for him.\nFormer chancellor Rishi Sunak appears set to become party leader and prime minister. He ended Sunday with more than 165 supporters ahead of Monday\u2019s nomination deadline.\nThe chances of a general election have risen, according to some estimations. Johnson supporter Nadine Dorries has said an election was now \u201cimpossible to avoid\u201d. Labour, which has opened up huge poll leads, is demanding an election. Angela Rayner, the deputy leader, said: \u201cThe Tories are about to hand the keys of the country to Rishi Sunak without him saying a single word about how he would govern. No one voted for this. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising he\u2019s avoiding scrutiny: after all, he was so bad that just a few weeks ago, he was trounced by Liz Truss.\u201d\nContender Penny Mordaunt, who missed out on the last contest\u2019s run-off by just eight votes, is now under pressure to concede rather than force the contest to a vote of members. However, a source on the Mordaunt campaign insisted her campaign was continuing and that she wanted to get on the ballot so party members could decide the result.\nMordaunt could yet win over any former Johnson supporters who want to stop Sunak. Each needs to submit nominations by 2pm on Monday. If both get more than 100 nominations, 150,000 Tory members will be asked to decide the result.\nMordaunt tweeted praise of Johnson early on Monday, saying he had \u2018put country before party and party before self\u2019, in what appears to be an attempt to woo Johnson supporters.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.02am BST\n\n\n 7.00am  \nMordaunt: Johnson 'put country before party and party before self'\n\nPenny Mordaunt is awake and tweeting her support of Johnson, saying that he \u201cput country before party, and party before self\u201d. She did not reveal anything about where her own bid stands, but this may signal that she is planning to get the backing of MPs who declared their support for Johnson:\n\n\nUpdated at 7.02am BST\n\n\n 6.57am  \nMordaunt urged to pull out of contest now by ConservativeHome editor, Paul Goodman\n\nA few minutes ago on BBC Radio 4, Paul Goodman, the editor of the website ConservativeHome and a former Conservative MP, urged Penny Mordaunt to pull out of the contest now. He said:\n\nI have to say to Penny Mordaunt, if she\u2019s listening out there, just for the good of the Conservative party in the country, just don\u2019t push it.\nBecause look at the figures. Rishi Sunak has, according to our count, and other counts are very similar, he\u2019s got 155 supporters. Now 179 is half the parliamentary party. So he\u2019s really almost there. \nShe\u2019s starting from a base of 26. \nAnd what I think no one in the Conservative party seriously ought to want \u2013 I think it certainly would not be in the public interest \u2013 for there to be what we faced a few hours ago with Boris Johnson, a ballot in which one candidate won, clearly having the support of MPs, and party members then foisted another one on them without their consent.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.17am BST\n\n\n 6.55am  \n\nFrom BBC Newsnight\u2019s UK editor, Sima Kotecha\n\n\nUpdated at 7.29am BST\n\n\n 6.54am  \n\nCentre-right thinktank Onward has found that \u201cthe Conservatives face oblivion if they do not fully break with Trussonomics\u201d \u2013 with a survey of 10,000 people revealing that more than one in three voters \u201crate their chances of ever voting Conservative at zero per cent\u201d.\n\nIn results published today, the think tank writes: \n\nThe Conservative party is now deeply unpopular with great swathes of the public. More than one in three voters (35%) rate their chances of ever voting Conservative at zero per cent and nearly half (46%) rate it as extremely unlikely ( less than 10% likelihood). Meanwhile, Labour leads the Conservatives on every issue excluding defence and Brexit, including a 10-point lead on the cost of living, the most salient issue by a wide margin, and a two-point lead on the economy.\nThe average Conservative voter is now older than they ever have been. The tipping point at which someone becomes more likely to vote Conservative rather than Labour has risen to 57 years old, up from 43 in 2019. This means that anyone born after 1965 is more likely to vote Labour than Conservative.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.07am BST\n\n\n 6.44am  \n\nAfter Jodie Whittaker\u2019s tenure as the first woman to lead Doctor Who came to an end with her regenerating into the returning Time Lord David Tennant, a reminder that Liz Truss is the only British PM since the show started in 1963 not to have a single episode air in her time at the top:\n\n\n\n\n 6.40am  \n\nBBC political correspondent Nick Eardley points out that a lot of people will be paying attention to the last few words in Johnson\u2019s statement last night. Johnson said, \u201cI believe I have much to offer but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time\u201d \u2013 which seems to imply that he will be back at some stage.\n\nUpdated at 7.27am BST\n\n\n 6.30am  \n\nStephen McPartland, the member for Stevenage who backed Johnson \u2013 using the hashtag \u201c#BringBackBoris\u201d multiple times in the last few days \u2013 has just tweeted that he \u201crespects Johnson\u2019s decision\u201d and that he \u201cstood aside in the national interest\u201d:\n\nHe has not yet said who he will be supporting instead.\n\nUpdated at 7.26am BST\n\n\n 6.23am  \n\nThe pound rose slightly after former UK prime minister Boris Johnson said he would not stand for the Conservative leadership again, after the resignation of Liz Truss last week.\nThe pound was up at $1.1318 against the dollar this morning, from $1.1258 on Friday. The Euro, too, fell against the pound, down at 86.93 pence from 87.26 pence.\nHis decision leaves his former finance minister Rishi Sunak the favourite to take the reins and become the country\u2019s third premier this year.\nThe choice of the less-controversial Sunak could provide a little stability in Westminster after weeks of turmoil sparked by Truss\u2019s debt-fuelled mini-budget that hammered the pound and sent shivers through markets.\n\n\n\n 6.19am  \n\nI\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with for the next while. If you have questions or see news we may have missed, you can get in touch on Twitter here.\n\n\n\n 6.18am  \n\nWe\u2019re expected to hear from Nadhim Zahawi, who made a dizzying U-turn from supporting Johnson to supporting Sunak yesterday, on Sky News at 07.05 this morning. \nGrant Shapps, the home secretary and another Sunak supporter, will be on BBC Breakfast at 0710, Sky News at 0720, GMB and Times Radio at 0750, and LBC at 0820.\n\n\n\n 6.12am  \n\nIn more news on what the new PM will inherit: the NHS is launching an effort to recruit tens of thousands of nurses to help fill the record number of vacancies that low pay, Covid and heavy workloads have created across the service. \nIt comes soon after NHS figures showed that the number of empty posts in nursing across hospitals, mental health, community care and other services had reached 46,828 \u2013 the largest number ever. That means that more than one in 10 nursing roles (11.8%) are unfilled across the service overall.\nThe Health Service Journal recently reported that a record number of NHS staff \u2013 almost 35,000 \u2013 voluntarily resigned from their posts between April and June this year, with \u201cwork-life balance\u201d the most common reason for doing so.\nAlmost 40,000 nurses quit the NHS over the last year \u2013 again, the most ever \u2013 recent analysis by the Nuffield Trust found.\nIn 2019, the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, promised to boost the number of nurses in England by 50,000 by 2024:\n\n\n\n\n 6.04am  \n\nIt won\u2019t be Boris Johnson, but whoever the new prime minister turns out to be, they will have been dragged into office by \u201ceconomic orthodoxy\u201d and its henchmen. Their mandate is pre-written in the data you have been deluged with about the impact of unfunded tax cuts, from the depreciation of the pound to rises in interest rates, and the untenable upward effect this has had on mortgages and rents. The charts have spoken \u2013 an ideological experiment has gone terribly wrong and must be reversed.\nBut it is a tale of two crises, and only one is being told. Attracting far less fanfare is another set of statistics about cold and hunger. More than a million people are expected to be pushed into poverty this winter. Their slide into deprivation will test an informal support network already stretched to its limit. Last week, the food bank charity the Trussell Trust launched an emergency appeal for donations because need for food banks has now outstripped donations. Charities like this, private citizens and schools are mobilising to bridge the gap.\nThe hole is too large to plug. Half of all primary schools in England are trying to feed children in poverty who are ineligible for free school meals because their parents\u2019 income does not meet the threshold. But there are 800,000 of them. It can be hard sometimes to grasp the scale of the problem through bare statistics, but vivid and haunting details can flesh them out. Children are eating school rubbers to line their stomachs and dull the ache and nausea of hunger. Others are bringing in empty lunchboxes then pretending to dine on their phantom food away from classmates, too ashamed to reveal that they have nothing to eat.\nIf these children\u2019s families can\u2019t afford to eat, they definitely can\u2019t afford to keep warm as winter approaches and energy prices rocket:\n\n\n\n\n 6.03am  \nThe front pages\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s sudden exit from the Tory leadership race fills the UK front pages on Monday, with some throwing forward to Sunak\u2019s likely success in the race ahead. \nHere is a roundup by my colleague Jonathan Yerushalmy: \n\n\n\n\n 5.55am  \n\nIf he finds himself as prime minister, possibly as soon as Monday, Sunak will have to find depths of political creativity and diplomacy to deal with a nightmare in-tray. He has been an MP for just seven years, and was a cabinet minister for only two, and even colleagues who back him for the premiership acknowledge he has no breadth of experience across departments to prepare him for the multiple crises piling up on all fronts.\nFrom the NHS still struggling with Covid, to the economic situation, to the prospect of energy blackouts and a threatened winter of discontent with strikes, the UK is facing a phenomenally difficult six months.\nThe Conservatives are also deeply divided in parliament. A broad spectrum of MPs have come out for Sunak, from Suella Braverman and Steve Baker on the right to Bob Neill and Stephen Hammond from the centrist wing, and he will have made many promises in order to extract such support, from Eurosceptics in particular.\nMany of the dilemmas that Truss faced still remain. Does he go for growth on the back of higher immigration, or stick to post-Brexit promises of tougher curbs? Can he keep to Johnson\u2019s 2019 promises of no return to austerity, or will he argue that the current market conditions mean cuts are essential?\nDoes he ask the public to try to cut back their energy use to avoid winter blackouts? Will he take a conciliatory position towards striking public sector workers or try to turn it into a culture war issue with Labour? No one knows, because he has done no media interviews since Truss resigned on Thursday:\n\n\n\n\n 5.43am  \n\nSajid Javid is awake and has shared an op-ed he has written in today\u2019s Times.\nJavid, who voiced his support for Sunak on Saturday, makes the case in the piece for the importance of a united Conservative party which needs to win back the trust of voters, pointing out that the British public feel lately that the Conservative party is neither popular nor \u201ccompetent in acting in the national interest\u201d:\n\nWe may not have always been popular but we have been seen to be competent in acting in the national interest. Sadly, the public are increasingly concluding we are neither. As it stands, Sir Keir Starmer is on course to win a Blair-size majority at the next general election.\nThe long-term consequences of such a victory would be disastrous. We know that support for proportional representation, a lower voting age of sixteen, and changes to rules on political donations is deep-rooted within Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. We would be left in the political wilderness for years under a series of coalition governments.\n\nHe describes Sunak as \u201cadept at building a strong team, devising policy and communicating to the public\u201d: \n\n\nUpdated at 5.48am BST\n\n\n 5.39am  \nPenny Mordaunt has at least 30 backers \u2013 70 short of number needed by 2 p.m.\n\nJohnson\u2019s withdrawal from the race late on Sunday puts pressure on Penny Mordaunt, the third candidate in the race, to withdraw and accept that Sunak had the support of the parliamentary party, with almost half of MPs backing him. She had only 30 public backers by Sunday night \u2013 70 short of the number needed to get on the ballot paper.\nA source on the Mordaunt campaign insisted her campaign was continuing and that she wanted to get on the ballot so party members could decide the result.\n\u201cPenny is the unifying candidate who is most likely to keep the wings of the Conservative party together and polling shows that she is the most likely candidate to hold on to the seats the Conservative party gained in 2019. [Former shadow chancellor] Ed Balls, shadow cabinet ministers and Labour advisers have all said Penny is the candidate Keir Starmer fears the most.\u201d\nSunak is expected to sweep up many more Tory MPs on Monday morning given he has the momentum, but Mordaunt could win over any former Johnson supporters who want to stop him. The pair need to submit nominations by 2pm on Monday, and 150,000 Tory members will be asked to decide the result if they both get more than 100 nominations.\n\n\n\n 5.33am  \nRishi Sunak has at least 165 nominations\n\nRishi Sunak is the firm favourite in today\u2019s race. Sunak came second in the race against Liz Truss over the summer, but racked up nominations over the weekend, ranging from rightwingers such as Kemi Badenoch and Suella Braverman to more centrist figures such as Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, and Grant Shapps, the home secretary.\nHe ended Sunday on more than 165 supporters including Cabinet Office minister Nadhim Zahawi, who had hours earlier heralded the return of what he termed \u201cJohnson 2.0\u201d.\nA source close to Sunak told my colleague Rowena Mason that he was \u201cnot taking anything for granted\u201d. \u201cRishi will be continuing to talk to colleagues tomorrow morning before nomination papers go in, and discussing how best to unite the party and take the country forward,\u201d the campaign source said. If he succeeds he would become Britain\u2019s first non-white PM and, as a Hindu, his victory would be sealed on Diwali.\nFollowing Johnson\u2019s withdrawal late on Sunday, Sunak praised his political rival noting on Twitter that Johnson \u201cdelivered Brexit and the great vaccine roll-out\u201d and \u201cled our country through some of the toughest challenges we have ever faced\u201d. Britain would \u201calways be grateful to him for that\u201d, he wrote, adding, \u201cI truly hope he continues to contribute to public life at home and abroad.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.30am  \nEarly morning summary\n\nHello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the Tory party leadership contest. With the 2pm deadline for nominations approaching, at least 165 MPs have declared support for Rishi Sunak \u2013 well above the 100 needed. With Boris Johnson out of the running, Sunak\u2019s only rival is Penny Mordaunt, who on Sunday night had 30 supporters.\nThe pair need to submit nominations by 2pm on Monday, and 150,000 Tory members will be asked to decide the result if they both get more than 100 nominations.\nMy name is Helen Sullivan, and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next while. If you have questions or see news we may have missed, you can get in touch on Twitter here. \nIn the meantime, here is a summary of what happened on an eventful Sunday.\n\nFormer prime minister Boris Johnson has ended his bid to return to power within months of being ousted, claiming that although he had the numbers, he would not run to replace Liz Truss, who resigned as Conservative party leader on Thursday after just 45 days in office. Johnson claimed to have won the support of 102 colleagues \u2013 two clear of the threshold needed \u2013 but only about 60 had publicly stated their support for him.\nJohnson said he reached the decision reluctantly after recognising he would not lead \u201ca united party in parliament\u201d. He said, \u201cIn the course of the last days I have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do,\u201d and, \u201cYou can\u2019t govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament.\u201d Read his full statement here.\nFormer chancellor Rishi Sunak praised Johnson on Twitter late on Sunday, noting Johnson \u201cdelivered Brexit and the great vaccine roll-out\u201d and \u201cled our country through some of the toughest challenges we have ever faced\u201d. Britain would \u201calways be grateful to him for that\u201d, he wrote, adding, \u201cI truly hope he continues to contribute to public life at home and abroad.\u201d\nSunak appears set to become party leader and prime minister. He ended Sunday with more than 165 supporters ahead of Monday\u2019s nomination deadline. Sunak came second in the race against Truss over the summer.\nThe chances of a general election have risen, according to some estimations. Johnson supporter Nadine Dorries has said an election was now \u201cimpossible to avoid\u201d. Labour, which has opened up huge poll leads, is demanding an election. Angela Rayner, the deputy leader, said: \u201cThe Tories are about to hand the keys of the country to Rishi Sunak without him saying a single word about how he would govern. No one voted for this. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising he\u2019s avoiding scrutiny: after all, he was so bad that just a few weeks ago, he was trounced by Liz Truss.\u201d\nContender Penny Mordaunt, who missed out on the last contest\u2019s run-off by just eight votes, will now come under pressure to concede rather than force the contest to a vote of members. However a source on the Mordaunt campaign insisted her campaign was continuing and that she wanted to get on the ballot so party members could decide the result.\nJohnson and Sunak held talks late into Saturday night, according to reports. The ex-leader also reportedly spoke on Sunday to Mordaunt, who was said to have rebuffed his calls to back him, noting her supporters were likely to split more for Sunak.\nMordaunt could yet win over any former Johnson supporters who want to stop Sunak. Each needs to submit nominations by 2pm on Monday. If both get more than 100 nominations, 150,000 Tory members will be asked to decide the result.\nSunak launched his official campaign with a declaration that \u201cfixing the economy\u201d was his priority, but he gave no media interviews or formal manifesto. If Sunak succeeds on Monday he will become Britain\u2019s first non-white PM, and as a Hindu, his victory will be sealed on Diwali.\nMordaunt spoke to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, telling her she would be a \u201chalfway house\u201d between Sunak and Johnson but refused to be drawn on any economic policies or decisions on tax and spending.\nA survey by Conservative pollster James Johnson still found all three Tory candidates had negative favourability. The survey found that Johnson was on -24, Mordaunt -15 and Sunak -2.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.22am BST\n"

The EU will invite others to contribute to the fund. Rishi Sunak has been handed a boost from figures showing lower UK government borrowing than official estimates on the eve of the spring statement. The figures come despite a sharp rise in debt interest payments last month amid soaring inflation. The Office for National Statistics said borrowing over the first 11 months of the financial year 2021-22 was \u00a3138.4bn, less than half the sum borrowed a year earlier and almost \u00a326bn less than estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility in October. Analysts say this gives the chancellor wriggle room for a support package of measures aimed at helping struggling households during the cost of living crisis. Several economists are expected a giveaway worth \u00a310bn to \u00a311bn.  Record numbers of UK manufacturers are raising prices as the war in Ukraine gives an added twist to inflationary pressures, the latest snapshot of industry by the CBI has shown.  Stock markets have moved higher. The FTSE 100 index in London is 30 points ahead at 7,472, a 0.4% gain. The German, French and Italian markets have all climbed more than 1%. Crude oil prices have fallen back after earlier gains. Brent crude is down 1.1% at $114.30 a barrel while US light crude is 2.5% lower at $109.65 a barrel. Natural gas prices are rising, but are far below the record highs reached at the start of this month. The British April wholesale gas contract is up 5.8% at 236.75p per therm. The cruise operator Carnival Corporation, which owns the Cunard and Holland America cruise lines, is forecasting a loss this year because of surging fuel prices. Analysts at Jefferies reckon costs could be 8%-10% higher than previously estimated in the first half of the year, and 10%-11% higher in the second half.

Take care \u2013 JK     2.13pm   Swiss prosecutors set up taskforce to pursue sanctions-busting  Swiss federal prosecutors have set up a taskforce to go pursue potential sanctions-busting and gather evidence of war crimes connected to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Switzerland, a popular destination for Moscow\u2019s elite and home for Russian wealth, is under mounting pressure to act faster in identifying and freezing assets of hundreds of sanctioned Russians. The Office of the Attorney General said it had established a Taskforce to examine potential violations of sanctions and to help pursue other potential crimes. It said: At present, the focus is primarily on the areas of international criminal law and the Embargo Act. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs he said were helping Putin wage war against Ukraine.      1.51pm    Carnival Corporation, the British-American cruise ship operator, has reported worse-than-expected quarterly revenues. A rise in Covid-19 infections due to the highly contagious Omicron variant held back cruise bookings during the first three months of this year. Several infections were identified among passengers on board ships owned by Carnival in December and January. The company said the Omicron wave of infections had an impact on bookings for its near-term sailings in the first quarter, including higher cancellations as more people tested positive for Covid-19 before they were able to go on their cruise. Carnival\u2019s revenues rose to $1.6bn between January and March, compared with $26m a year earlier when few people travelled because of the pandemic. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast $2.3bn. The company managed to shrink its net loss to $1.89bn from $1.97bn a year earlier.    Updated at 1.52pm GMT    1.39pm    NatWest is to join the booming but controversial \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d market this summer, becoming the first UK high street bank to announce a move into the multibillion-pound sector, reports my colleague Rupert Jones. The bank is still majority taxpayer-owned \u2013 though only just, as the government stake is now about 51% \u2013 after a state bailout during the financial crisis. Its 18 million-plus customers may be surprised to learn it is to offer this form of unregulated credit, which lets people delay payment for items ranging from clothes to pet food. However, NatWest said there was \u201ca clear demand\u201d for buy now, pay later (BNPL), and it was determined \u201cto make it better and safer\u201d.     1.38pm    And here\u2019s our full take on the CBI manufacturing survey, which shows record numbers of UK manufacturers are raising prices as the war in Ukraine gives an added twist to inflationary pressures. The employers\u2019 lobby group, the CBI, said 82% of firms were expecting to raise prices in the coming months against just 2% predicting a fall.      1.35pm    Here\u2019s our full story on the Russian oligarchs\u2019 superyachts:      1.28pm    And here\u2019s the latest in the P&amp;O saga. P&amp;O Ferries could face prosecution over the sacking of 800 workers, the UK business minister, Paul Scully, warned before a government ultimatum to the company. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said he will review all government contracts and dealings with the company and its owners, DP World. On Tuesday, the RMT union said seafarers from abroad had been brought in to replace the 800 sacked British crew and were being paid as little as \u00a31.80 an hour. P&amp;O Ferries disputes the figures but it declined to discuss the rates or give alternative rates and would not confirm whether it paid the minimum wage.      1.25pm   Russian oligarch superyacht seized in Gibraltar, as two of Abramovich's superyachts docked in Turkey  A superyacht belonging to a sanctioned Russian oligarch has been seized in Gibraltar, becoming the latest vessel to be impounded by authorities, reports our senior reporter Joanna Partridge. The $75m (\u00a357m) Axioma belonging to billionaire Dmitry Pumpyansky \u2013 owner and chairman of steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, which is a supplier to Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom \u2013 was seized by authorities in the British overseas territory on Monday. The news emerged as two of Roman Abramovich\u2019s superyachts were spotted docked in ports in Turkey, having cruised to new locations following the extension of sanctions to include the Chelsea FC owner. Yachts belonging to several Russian oligarchs have hastily arranged unplanned sailings, apparently moving them to avoid seizure by governments enforcing sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Turkey has not yet joined western economic sanctions against Russia.      1.14pm    The latest in our Russian asset tracker series: Alisher Usmanov, the Russian oligarch once said to be the UK\u2019s richest person, claims to have placed hundreds of millions of pounds of his assets into an irrevocable trust, potentially leaving them outside the sanctions regime established by western governments, reports my colleague Simon Goodley. The tycoon \u2013 a former 30% shareholder in Arsenal football club who has also ploughed millions into sponsoring Everton and is subject to sanctions \u2013 can today be revealed as connected to at least six luxury UK properties and one central London office building, collectively worth more than \u00a3170m and held via a complex web of offshore companies and family members.      12.43pm    EasyJet has become the latest airline to announce a relaxation of its mask-wearing policy. From Sunday, passengers and crew will no longer need to wear masks onboard if this is not legally required at either end of the route. This means mandatory mask-wearing will be dropped on UK domestic flights \u2013 excluding routes to and from Scotland, where face covering rules remain in place \u2013 and on flights between the UK and Denmark, Gibraltar, Iceland and Hungary. The Luton-based airline said:   As a pan-European airline operating between over 30 countries, we must continue to ensure that we and our customers follow the legal requirements of all the countries we fly to. This means when flying to or from countries where mask requirements remain in place, we will follow the relevant legal requirements. We urge European governments to have a coordinated approach on the removal of the requirement where possible, to make it easy and clear for customers. We will aim to provide clear information to customers, including while onboard, detailing the specific mask requirements on their flight.  Several other airlines have relaxed their mask-wearing rules in recent weeks, including British Airways, Jet2.com and Tui Airways.   Updated at 1.29pm GMT    12.20pm   Barclays: Ukraine war could hamper climate progress  Barclays said the disruption in energy markets since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine (which began nearly four weeks ago) could hamper its ability to meet its carbon emission reduction targets, while it toughened its climate commitments. In a notice ahead of its annual investor meeting, the UK bank also said it was planning more restrictive polices on coal, including final exit dates on a \u201cprogressive phase-out\u201d of thermal coal financing. Other banks, such as HSBC, have also firmed up their climate commitments, under pressure from climate activists, who are often supported by major shareholders. Last week, HSBC said it would further reduce the financing it provides to the fossil fuel industry, publish more data on how it is implementing its goals, and link executive pay to progress made on that front. Barclays said it would phase out financing of thermal coal mining by 2030 in 38 OECD countries and by 2035 in the rest of the world. The lender will also no longer take on new financing clients that generate more than 5% of their revenue from thermal coal mining from the start of next year. However, Barclays also warned that the Ukraine crisis could undermine its efforts.  We should recognise that the conflict currently taking place in Ukraine has greatly exacerbated existing supply pressures on energy systems, particularly in the UK and the EU. In the near term, the current disruptions may increase volatility in our progress towards our 2025 and 2030 emission reduction targets.  The bank said shareholders will be given a \u201cSay on Climate\u201d vote at its annual meeting in Manchester on 4 May.     12.07pm    As part of our Russian asset tracker series, an ongoing project, Simon Goodley has taken a look at Roman Abramovich\u2019s \u00a3250m property portfolio. The sanctioned Chelsea FC club owner, Roman Abramovich, and his family have amassed a UK property collection worth more than \u00a3250m, numbering about 70 homes, buildings and pieces of land.  And David Conn has looked at how the Russian businessman made his money: From poor orphan to billionaire oligarch. Roman Abramovich\u2019s journey from an impoverished, orphaned childhood to Chelsea-owning billionaire was forged in the chaotic transformation of Russia itself, in the years after the iron curtain fell. His elevation into an oligarch is unusually well documented, chronicled in painstaking detail in an English high court judgment of Lady Justice Gloster in 2012, when Abramovich succeeded in defending a lawsuit brought by his former mentor, Boris Berezovsky. In the case, both men described their careers, and routes to becoming billionaires, as \u201ca uniquely Russian story\u201d.      11.48am    The owner of B&amp;Q and Screwfix is handing workers a pay rise as the company\u2019s boss forecast that demand for energy-saving kit and the shift to working from home would keep fuelling the DIY boom, reports our retail correspondent, Sarah Butler. Pay for B&amp;Q workers will increase by 6.5% to \u00a39.80 an hour while Screwfix is increasing minimum staff pay by 5.4% to \u00a39.70 an hour from 1 April, putting both chains just ahead of the new legal minimum of \u00a39.50 which starts next month.      11.38am    In other news, the national lottery operator, Camelot, has been fined \u00a33.15m for three errors on its mobile app, which affected tens of thousands of players.  The first involved up to 20,000 users who were told their winning tickets had lost when they scanned a QR code between November 2016 and September 2020, the Gambling Commission said.   Updated at 1.07pm GMT    11.11am   CBI: record number of manufacturers to lift prices  The proportion of British manufacturers expecting to raise their prices over the next three months has hit its highest level since records began in 1975, according to a monthly survey from the CBI, Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby group. This underlines the scale of fast-growing inflation pressures. The balance of manufacturers expecting to put up prices rose to a record high in March (+80% from +77% in February), a question first asked in Jan 1975. The measure deducts the number of firms saying they will raise prices from those saying they will lower them. Manufacturers also reported higher order books this month, with the net balance matching November\u2019s all-time high of +26%. CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said:  This survey highlights strong order books and output growth, but the cost pressures facing manufacturers have been amplified by the conflict in Ukraine. The government must use tomorrow\u2019s Spring Statement to provide relief to both energy-intensive industries and vulnerable consumer.  The survey of 229 manufacturers was conducted between 24 February and 14 March.  Updated at 11.15am GMT    11.03am   Market summary  Oil prices have slipped back, with Brent now just over $115 a barrel while US light crude is just above $111, as European Union members are split on whether to join the United States in banning Russian oil.  Some, such as Germany, say the bloc is too reliant on Russian supplies, while the Baltic states and Poland have been urging a Russian oil embargo, as part of sanctions on Moscow. European shares have moved cautiously higher. The FTSE 100 index in London has risen 39 points, or 0.5%, to 7,481. The German market has advanced 0.8% while France is up 0.7% and Italy is nearly 1% higher.     10.15am    On the stock markets, shares are pushing cautiously higher. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained 39 points, or 0.5%, to 7,482 while Germany\u2019s Dax is 1% ahead, France\u2019s CAC has risen 0.76% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is up nearly 1%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has edged 0.5% higher, after posting its biggest weekly gain since November 2020 last week. Crude oil has given up earlier price gains and is trading lower on the day in a volatile market. Brent crude has lost 1.3% to $114.09 a barrel while US light crude is off 2% at $109.8 a barrel.     10.10am    While British and European natural gas prices are up a bit again today, they remain far below the record highs hit at the start of this month, when the British gas contract soared above 500p a therm and Dutch gas hit \u20ac200 per megawatt hour. Panmure Gordon\u2019s chief economist Simon French says this means the UK energy price cap would rise by 13% in October, rather than 50% as feared \u2013 but this will obviously depend on where gas prices go from here.   Updated at 10.25am GMT    10.02am   UK fuel prices slip \u2013 RAC  Yesterday was the first day this month when fuel prices did not rise to new record highs, according to the RAC motoring group. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said:   Monday marked the first day this month where average fuel prices didn\u2019t reach new record heights. Prices steadied with very slight reductions in both petrol and diesel perhaps indicating that retailers may have finished passing on their increased wholesale costs for the time being. To put things in perspective for drivers the delivered wholesale price of petrol currently stands at \u00a31.30 and diesel at \u00a31.48. With prices this high before retailer margin and 20% VAT are added, it\u2019s clear we are in a tough place when it comes to being able to afford to drive. This is why it\u2019s crucial the chancellor takes decisive and meaningful action in his spring statement that helps hard-pressed drivers and businesses.  Rishi Sunak is expected to announce a fuel duty cut, among other things.   Updated at 10.17am GMT    9.48am    Parents already feeling the squeeze from higher food and energy bills could soon be facing higher childcare costs as nurseries struggle to stay open amid their own surging energy bills and higher staff costs, writes Jenn Selby. Research found 95% of nurseries in England do not have enough funding to cover basic costs after Covid hit.  Hundreds of thousands of people of colour may be paying an \u201cethnicity penalty\u201d of at least \u00a3280 a year each in higher car insurance costs, an investigation by Citizens Advice has claimed. The national charity said its year-long investigation had uncovered a \u201cshocking trend\u201d of people of colour paying a lot more for motor cover than white people, and that the penalty was up to \u00a3950 in some locations, writes my colleague Rupert Jones on the Money desk.   Updated at 10.04am GMT    9.47am    Here\u2019s our full story on Shell\u2019s reported U-turn on its exit from a controversial oil field off the Shetlands.  Climate activists have reacted with concern to reports that Shell is reconsidering its decision to abandon development of the Cambo oilfield, warning that such a reversal would further threaten emissions reductions targets, writes my colleague Jasper Jolly. The fossil fuel producer could U-turn on a decision to pull out of the North Sea project because the \u201ceconomic, political and regulatory environment had changed enormously since the decision was announced just three months ago\u201d, according to sources cited by the BBC. Mark van Baal, the leader of the campaign group Follow This, said a decision to develop Cambo would contravene guidance by the International Energy Agency, a respected global body. Last year the IEA said the exploration and development of new oil and gas must stop immediately if the world is to have any chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, the target set at the 2015 UN climate talks in Paris. Shell has itself pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but has not outlined detailed steps of how it will reduce its fossil fuel output. \u201cAny new fields will be stranded if we are to meet the Paris climate targets,\u201d van Baal said, adding that Shell\u2019s pledge to reach net zero by 2050 would be \u201creally empty without action this decade\u201d. \u201cWe know this is a response to the Ukraine war,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only good response to the Ukraine war is to replace Russian fossil fuels with renewables.\u201d      9.37am    British and Dutch gas prices are rising again today in a volatile market, amid forecasts for colder weather. The British gas for day-ahead delivery rose 10p to 219p per therm this morning, while the Dutch contract increased \u20ac1.88, or 2%, to \u20ac94.28 per megawatt hour. Analysts at Refinitiv said:  The cold snap expected next week [in Europe] may lift residential consumption and provide a bullish signal to the prompt [prices].  However, fears over supply disruption have waned, as gas flows from Russia have remained steady, despite the escalating war in Ukraine.     9.31am   EU leaders to jointly buy gas, LNG, hydrogen for next winter \u2013 draft statement  Leaders from EU countries will agree at a summit this week to jointly buy gas, liquefied natural gas and hydrogen ahead of next week, according to a draft summit statement, seen by Reuters. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Europe\u2019s top gas supplier, has sent energy prices surging and left the EU scrambling to cut Russian gas use this year \u2013 which will require higher imports from other countries such as Qatar and the United States. The draft statement for the EU leaders\u2019 summit on Thursday and Friday reads:  With a view to next winter, member states and the Commission will urgently... work together on the joint purchase of gas, LNG and hydrogen.  The draft statement said countries agreed to coordinate measures to fill gas storage and start doing so \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.  The European Commission last year had already proposed a system for EU countries to jointly buy strategic stocks of gas to provide a buffer against potential supply disruptions.     9.28am    Investec economist Sandra Horsfield said:  The bigger question is, however, how resilient the economy will be to the indirect consequences of the war in Ukraine, which is hard to gauge accurately in such a fluid situation. This will influence how much support the government will have to offer, and also have important consequences for the outlook for public finances by shaping likely tax receipts.  Perhaps the most encouraging news from today\u2019s report, from the chancellor\u2019s perspective, will have been the sizeable downward revisions to back data, which lowered reported borrowing for the fiscal year-to-date by \u00a313.2bn and also saw 2020/21 borrowing down by \u00a34.1bn relative to previous estimates.  This leaves a fiscal-year deficit for 2021/22 of \u00a3150bn or perhaps even less entirely within play, far below the \u00a3183bn the OBR had pencilled in at the time of the Budget. Such a material undershoot will add to room for manoeuvre for Mr Sunak to help buffer some of the cost-of-living crisis at tomorrow\u2019s spring statement.      9.22am    Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, has looked at what the chancellor might do tomorrow.  Notwithstanding the deterioration in the public finances in February, large revisions to the back data mean that borrowing in 2021/22 is on track to undershoot the OBR\u2019s October 2021 forecast by a huge \u00a323bn.  Even so, we suspect the sharper rise in debt interest costs in February than many expected may embolden the chancellor to keep a fairly tight grip on the public finances in tomorrow\u2019s spring statement. While the Chancellor may still have at least \u00a323bn of headroom against his main fiscal rule for the underlying debt ratio to be falling in three years\u2019 time, we expect hopes of a big handout at the spring statement tomorrow to be dashed.  The Chancellor will try to balance the near-term benefits of supporting households with the medium-term goal of fiscal restraint, allowing him to loosen policy ahead of the 2024 election. We have pencilled a \u00a310bn support package, with roughly half aimed at easing the cost of living crisis for households.       9.17am    Consumer confidence in the UK economy and future household finances has plummeted to the lowest levels since 2020, according to research from the consumer group Which?.  It urged businesses and government to do more to support the most financially vulnerable ahead of tomorrow\u2019s spring statement. Just one in 10 consumers think the economy will improve over the next 12 months, and three quarters think things will get worse - giving a net confidence score in the economy of -64. This compares to -19 just last month and is the lowest since October 2020. Confidence in future household finances also dropped significantly, with consumers clearly anticipating that the worsening state of the economy will affect their own finances. This measure dropped to -40 compared to -21 in February, the lowest figure since the first national lockdown was announced in March 2020. Financial difficulty has continued to grow among households, with more than half (54%) of consumers saying their household has had to make an adjustment \u2013 such as cutting back on essentials or dipping into savings \u2013 to cover essential spending in the past month.  Worryingly, an estimated 2.1 million households missed or defaulted on at least one mortgage, rent, loan, credit card or bill in the last month. Rent and bills were the most common types of missed payment, with 6% of renters missing their rent payment and 5% of all consumers saying their household had missed a bill payment, typically on energy, phone or water bills.  Six in 10 (61%) of those who said they\u2019d missed a bill payment said they had missed more than one - highlighting the extreme pressure that some households are under during the cost of living crisis.      9.10am    Julian Jessop, economics fellow at free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the chancellor has room to ease the pressure on households and businesses in tomorrow\u2019s spring statement.  The UK government borrowed about \u00a35bn more than expected in February, as higher debt interest costs offset a rise in tax revenues. Nonetheless, favourable revisions to past months mean that borrowing is still on track to undershoot the OBR\u2019s forecast for the fiscal year 2021-22 by about \u00a324bn. Looking forward, rising inflation will keep debt servicing costs high. But OBR analysis (published in last October\u2019s Economic and Fiscal Outlook) has already shown that an inflation shock is likely to reduce borrowing overall, thanks to the boost to revenues, even with much larger hikes in official interest rates. Inflation will surely reduce the burden of debt relative to national income, especially with real interest rates likely to remain low \u2013 even negative \u2013 for the foreseeable future. Indeed, debt has already fallen to 94.7 per cent of GDP, from a recent peak of more than 100 per cent. In short, there is nothing in these numbers to prevent the chancellor from easing the pressure on households and businesses in tomorrow\u2019s spring statement.      8.41am    Here is our full story on the government borrowing figures.      8.38am   Shell reconsiders exit from oil field off Shetlands \u2013 BBC  Energy giant Shell is reconsidering its recent decision to withdraw from a controversial large new UK oil field off the Shetland Islands, the BBC is reporting. In December, Shell, which was planning to exploit the Cambo field along with the private equity-backed fossil fuel explorer Siccar Point, cited a weak economic case, along with potential regulatory delays, as its reason for deciding not to go ahead with the project. However, the company appears to have made a U-turn. At the time, the price of crude oil was below $70 a barrel, which has since risen to $115 a barrel follow Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has raised fears over disruption to Russian oil supplies. Oil prices tend to be volatile, but could well remain high for a while as there is little hope of an imminent end to the war. The BBC reported:  Shell has not yet sold its interests in the field. Sources close to the matter said that, while the company\u2019s official position had not changed, it did acknowledge that the economic, political and regulatory environment had changed enormously since the decision was announced just three months ago.   Updated at 8.47am GMT    8.14am    European stocks have opened cautiously higher. The FTSE 100 index in London is 0.2% ahead at 7,459, a 16 point gain. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.3%, France\u2019s CAC edged up 0.1% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has posted the biggest gain, of 0.6%.     7.50am    On the VAT front, the pub chain Wetherspoon has criticised the government\u2019s plans to increase VAT to its pre-pandemic level of 20% for food sold in pubs, restaurants and cafes in April. VAT was cut to 5% in July 2020 to help struggling businesses. Wetherspoon founder and chairman, Tim Martin, claims it\u2019s not fair to charge VAT on food sold in pubs and restaurants, but not in supermarkets.  It doesn\u2019t make economic sense that food bought in pubs, restaurants and cafes attracts VAT of 20%, when food is VAT-free in supermarkets. Pubs, restaurants and cafes form integral parts of high streets, whereas supermarkets are often in edge-of-town or out-of-town locations. Favouring supermarkets over pubs is bad for high streets and town centres. It is also an accepted principle of taxation that it should be fair and equitable, treating businesses that sell similar products in a similar way. The hospitality industry understands that governments need tax \u2013 but there should be a sensible rebalancing, so that all businesses selling similar products are treated in the same way.       7.45am    While public sector net borrowing was higher than expected last month, borrowing in the first 11 months of this fiscal year amounted to \u00a3138.4bn \u2013 less than half the sum borrowed a year earlier and almost \u00a330bn less than estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility in October. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has looked at the data in detail.   Government expenditure on goods and services also appears to have been much higher than expected, perhaps due to unexpected Covid-related spending linked to Omicron. Meanwhile, central government tax receipts of \u00a371.9bn in February were \u00a33.2bn above the OBR\u2019s forecast, primarily due to strength in VAT receipts, which have benefited from rising prices. But the margin of outperformance has declined since the autumn. GDP no longer is tracking a much higher path than the OBR expected, while households appear to have paid self-assessment taxes on a more timely basis this year than last.  Nonetheless, the substantial downward revision to borrowing in previous months leaves the full-year figure on track to greatly undershoot the OBR\u2019s \u00a3183bn forecast; a figure between \u00a3150bn and \u00a3155bn now seems likely. We expect the chancellor to tread cautiously tomorrow, and to announce a limited package of measures, amounting to a net giveaway in 2022/23 of about \u00a313bn, or 0.5% of GDP. That probably would mean that households still will experience this year the biggest annual decline in their real disposable income since the Second World War.   Updated at 8.27am GMT    7.36am    The chancellor\u2019s response to the higher-than-expected government borrowing was:  The ongoing uncertainty caused by global shocks means it\u2019s more important than ever to take a responsible approach to the public finances.  With inflation and interest rates still on the rise, it\u2019s crucial that we don\u2019t allow debt to spiral and burden future generations with further debt.\u201d Look at our record, we have supported people - and our fiscal rules mean we have helped households while also investing in the economy for the longer term.  Sunak is expected to announce a fuel duty cut tomorrow to help struggling households, for example.   Updated at 7.38am GMT    7.31am   Introduction: UK government borrowing higher than expected ahead of mini-budget  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK government borrowing rose more than expected last month, as rising inflation pushed up debt interest payments, handing Rishi Sunak disappointing news the day before he presents his spring statement in the Commons (a kind of mini budget). The Office for National Statistics said the government\u2019s budget deficit \u2013 the gap between spending and income \u2013 was \u00a313.1bn in February, the second-highest borrowing figure for that month since records began in 1993. Economists had forecast a shortfall of \u00a38.1bn. Soaring inflation pushed up interest payments on government debt by more than 50% to \u00a38.2bn, the highest February on record, reports our economics correspondent Richard Partington.  Over in the US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell wants interest rates to rise faster, saying the Fed must move \u201cexpeditiously\u201d to raise rates and possibly \u201cmore aggressively\u201d to stop an upward price spiral from becoming entrenched. Goldman Sachs thinks this is a signal that a 50 basis point rate hike is coming, and is forecasting one at the May meeting, and another one in June. Oil prices are climbing again, with Brent crude up 2.8% to $118.44 a barrel while US light crude is at $114.32 a barrel. EU foreign ministers discussed a potential oil embargo on Russia at a meeting in Brussels yesterday, and hopes of a breakthrough in the ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia are receding. However, EU members are split on whether to join the US in adding Russian oil to the sanctions. Asian shares were lifted by energy and mining stocks, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 1.5% higher while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 2.1% and the Shanghai Composite was little changed. Chinese markets are braced for policy easing, after it was flagged by authorities last week. The Guardian has launched its new Russian asset tracker, in partnership with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and other international news organisations. More than $17bn (\u00a313bn) of global assets \u2013 including offshore bank accounts, yachts, private jets and luxury properties in London, Tuscany and the French Riviera \u2013 have been linked to 35 oligarchs and Russian officials alleged to have close ties to Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s an ongoing project to track the wealth of Russia\u2019s most powerful operators.

Please join us again tomorrow. Take care \u2013 JK\n\nUpdated at 3.07pm BST\n\n\n 3.05pm  \n\nThe energy industry has united behind a plan to set up a crisis fund that could prevent bills from soaring next year and provide a lifeline for households struggling with the cost of living.\nEnergy UK, the trade body for the sector, has written to the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, to back calls for a \u201cdeficit tariff scheme\u201d to be established as a long-term solution to the energy crisis.\nUnder the plan, commercial banks would put cash into the state-backed fund, which suppliers could then draw on to freeze customers\u2019 bills at the current price cap, \u00a31,971, for two years.\nThe cost of the scheme would then be paid back over 10 to 15 years through a surcharge on bills or via taxation. However, the scheme could create a debt pile of up to \u00a350bn, far greater than alternatives including Labour leader Keir Starmer\u2019s \u00a329bn plan to freeze the price cap.\n\n\n\n\n 3.04pm  \n\nThe company that owns the rights to JRR Tolkien\u2019s works, including The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, has been bought by the Swedish gaming firm Embracer Group, which has hinted it could make spin-off films based on popular characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn and Gollum.\nEmbracer has acquired Middle-earth Enterprises, the holding company that controls the intellectual property rights to films, video games, board games, merchandise, theme parks and stage productions relating to Tolkien\u2019s two most famous literary franchises.\nThe deal also includes \u201cmatching rights\u201d in other Middle-earth-related literary works authorised by the Tolkien Estate and HarperCollins \u2013 primarily The Silmarillion and The Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth \u2013 which were published after Tolkien\u2019s death in 1973.\n\n\n\n\n 3.01pm  \n\nUS stocks on Wall Street were mostly flat, as investors assessed data showing a decline in weekly jobless claims. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 both dipped 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3%. \nInitial jobless claims fell by 2,000 to 250,000 in the week ended 13 August, according to data released Thursday by the Labor Department. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had forecast new claims to total 260,000.\n\n\n\n\n 2.50pm  \n\nHere\u2019s our full story on the rail strikes:\nRail passengers have faced another day of disruption, with the union leader Mick Lynch warning the dispute could go on \u201cindefinitely\u201d unless ministers intervene in talks.\nOnly 20% of train services were running on Thursday due to strike action across Great Britain that involved more than 45,000 rail workers, who are members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) and TSSA unions.\nCommuters were told to only try to travel if absolutely necessary, with further disruption planned on Friday and the weekend. In London, bus drivers and London Underground workers plan to strike in the coming days.\n\n\n\n\n 2.11pm  \n\nAll in a month\u2019s work: A 20-year-old US university student has made a $110m (\u00a391m) profit with a one-month bet on the meme stock Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\nJake Freeman and his family bought almost 5m shares in the struggling US homeware retailer at less than $5.50 a share in July for a total outlay of about $25m.\nAfter an almost 500% increase in the shares, sparked by intense chatter about the stock on Reddit message boards, including several posts by Freeman, he sold them for more than $130m \u2013 crystallising the vast profit.\nThey rose as high as $28 on Tuesday, when Freeman is understood to have sold most of his stake. The Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares, which trade on the ticker BBBY, dropped to $23 on Wednesday, and were down a further 14% in pre-market trading on Thursday to $19.70.\nMeme stocks are those that soar independently of the success of a business, thanks to hype on message boards and social media. They rose to prominence early last year when shares in ailing companies such as the US retail firm GameStop soared, partly driven by a campaign to punish hedge funds betting that their value would fall.\n\n\n\n\n 2.09pm  \n\nThe UK has blocked the takeover of an electronic design company by a Hong Kong rival over national security concerns, in the latest sign of growing British anxiety about Chinese investment.\nThe business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, took the decision to prevent Super Orange HK from acquiring Bristol-based Pulsic, saying it was \u201cnecessary and proportionate to mitigate the risk to national security\u201d.\nIt comes under the new National Security and Investment Act, which was introduced at the start of the year.\nThe government\u2019s move is its latest attempt to curtail Chinese ownership of significant British companies, in particular technology firms or those with strategic importance.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.07pm  \n\nBack to our rail theme. One of the UK\u2019s worst performing train operators has launched an investigation after passengers had to climb over a 7ft (2.1 metre) spiked fence to leave a station when staff locked up early.\nThe Avanti West Coast train from London was 100 minutes late arriving into Oxenholme on Tuesday night, by which time staff had locked the station and left for the night, passengers said. Some resorted to climbing the fence in scenes described by the local MP, Tim Farron, as \u201can unacceptable farce\u201d.\nAvanti told the MP it took the incident \u201cvery seriously\u201d and promised to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n 1.59pm  \n\nOn a lighter note, Rishi Sunak\u2019s habit of slightly awkward interactions with the everyday world has continued after he talked of enjoying McDonald\u2019s breakfast wraps \u2013 an item that disappeared from the fast food chain\u2019s UK menu nearly two-and-a-half years ago.\nThe former chancellor was speaking to ITV\u2019s This Morning programme a day after he was photographed at a branch of McDonald\u2019s, where again he appeared to struggle slightly to make a contactless card payment.\nAsked by hosts Rochelle Hughes and Andi Peters what he had eaten, Sunak explained that it had been about 7.30am, and so he ate a bacon roll with ketchup and pancakes.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m with my daughters then we get the wrap,\u201d the Conservative leadership hopeful continued. \u201cMy eldest daughter \u2013 if I\u2019m with her, it\u2019s the wrap with hash browns and everything in it. It\u2019s what we do.\u201d\nHowever, a McDonald\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the chain had stopped selling breakfast wraps in March 2020, a move made permanent with an announcement in January this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.41pm  \n\nTurkish president Tayyip Erdogan is losing confidence in Sahap Kavcioglu, his latest appointment as central bank governor, and the two have spoken little in recent weeks, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people.\nErdogan sacked Kavcioglu\u2019s predecessor less than seven months ago, and also fired two others in the last 2 1/2 years.\nThe rapid turnover has hurt the central bank\u2019s credibility, and has left inflation rocketing and the lira weak. Here is a history of the last four central bank governors, courtesy of Reuters:\nMurat Cetinkaya\u2019s early months as governor in 2016 were the last time when Turkey\u2019s inflation rate was within an official target range around 5%. Throughout 2018 he faced rising price pressures and lira depreciation that culminated in a full-blown currency crisis, which was driven by a diplomatic dispute over the release of a US pastor, the threat of US sanctions and emerging worries over Erdogan\u2019s influence over monetary policy.\nAnalysts said Cetinkaya was too slow to head off the crisis. By the time he raised the key policy interest rate to 24% in September of 2018, the economy was falling into a deep downturn that would bring an end to years of the strong economic growth that had come to define Erdogan\u2019s leadership since 2003. However, He held policy steady and brought about a sharp fall in annual inflation through most of 2019.\nWeeks after becoming governor, Murat Uysal - who had been Cetinkaya\u2019s deputy - began an aggressive easing cycle that brought the policy rate as low as 8.25% in 2020, from 24%. The cuts, combined with a boom in state-bank lending, helped ease financial stresses as the coronavirus pandemic hit. But with inflation rebounding, Uysal reversed course and began tightening again in his last few months at the central bank.\nA former finance minister and long-time member of Erdogan\u2019s AK Party, Naci Agbal took the reins on an explosive weekend in Turkish politics. A day after the appointment, Albayrak, Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law, announced his resignation as finance minister with a message on Instagram. Reuters later reported that Agbal had met with Erdogan days earlier to warn that the Albayrak-Uysal policy of currency interventions left the central bank\u2019s reserves vulnerable.\nAgbal quickly emerged as a respected inflation hawk and his short stint was dominated by aggressive rate hikes that picked up where Uysal left off. The lira rallied in response and some foreign investors edged back into Turkish assets after years of fleeing. Days before he too was fired early on a Saturday, Agbal raised rates one last time to 19%.\nAn ex-banker, Sahap Kavcioglu\u2019s arrival at the bank was met with a sharp market sell-off in which the lira briefly lost 15% of its value before recovering some losses. His previous columns in a pro-government newspaper showed he shared Erdogan\u2019s unorthodox view that high rates cause inflation, so investors prepared for prompt cuts. Yet as inflation continued to rise and the currency floundered, Kavcioglu held rates steady through the summer.\nBut with Erdogan publicly promising lower rates and inflation, Kavcioglu pivoted in September. He began giving dovish signals and urged investors to focus on a lower, core inflation measure, paving the way to a surprise 100 basis-point rate cut later that month that sent the lira to new all-time lows.\n\n\n\n 12.35pm  \n\nPartners at the accounting firm PwC UK have been handed more than \u00a31m each for the first time, after a double-digit rise in revenues across the business.\nThe firm said on Thursday it had increased average payouts for its 995 top-level employees to \u00a3920,000 for the 12 months to June, up 12% from a year earlier, after a jump in profits linked in part to higher income from its consulting services.\nPartners received another \u00a3105,000 each, on average, after sharing in proceeds linked to the disposal of its mobility and immigration business, which helped multinational businesses manage business travel, immigration issues, tax and salaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.24pm  \nTurkey's central bank delivers surprise rate cut, Norges Bank hikes rates\n\nTurkey\u2019s central bank has delivered a surprise interest rate cut to revive economic growth and sustain employment despite sky-high inflation.\nThe bank slashed its key rate to 13% from 14%, even though inflation rose to nearly 80% in July. Its monetary policy committee said in a statement:\n\nIt is important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth, as well as escalating geopolitical risk.\nAccordingly, the committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points, and has assessed that the updated level of policy rate is adequate under the current outlook.\n\nIt added that \u201cthe recent increase in spread between policy rate and the loan interest rate is considered to reduce the effectiveness of monetary transmission\u201d.\n\nTurkey\u2019s rate cut contrasts with the hikes delivered by other central banks.\nNorges Bank, Norway\u2019s central bank, raised its main rate to 1.75% from 1.2% today and flagged a further hike in September. Inflation in the Nordic country hit 4.5% in July, up from 3.6% in June and well ahead of expectations. \nGovernor Ida Wolden Bache said:\n\nA markedly higher policy rate is needed to ease the pressures in the Norwegian economy and to bring inflation down towards the target.\n\nThe rate-setting committee noted that there is a risk that \u201clittle spare capacity in the Norwegian economy and persistent global price pressures will lead to a further acceleration in price inflation\u201d.\nBut the committee also acknowledged the risk of a sharper slowdown in global growth.\n\nUpdated at 12.42pm BST\n\n\n 11.51am  \n\nElsewhere, eurozone inflation was confirmed at an annual rate of 8.9% in July, unchanged from the flash estimate, and up from 8.6% in June. \nKatharina Koenz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said:\n\nThe rise reflected a larger increase in food prices and still-very high energy inflation. Inflationary pressures continue to broaden as services prices also rose markedly, bringing core inflation to 4%.\nWith inflation not showing any signs of cooling off in the short term we expect another 50bps rate hike in September from the European Central Bank despite the weakening growth outlook.\n\n\n\n\n 11.11am  \nRail strikes: summary\n\nRMT general secretary Mick Lynch has warned that the rail dispute could go on\u201cindefinitely,\u201d as the latest strike by thousands of workers caused travel misery for passengers.\nHe called on the government to end its refusal to get involved in talks over pay, jobs and conditions, as he joined a picket line outside Euston station in London. Only around one in five trains are running across the country because of the walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA unions, on the first day of a fresh round of strikes.\nHe also warned that Britain could be brought by a standstill by a wave of strikes hitting \u201cevery sector of the economy,\u201d but stopped short of predicting a general strike.\n\nLynch said he fears finding a solution will not be possible because of \u201cpolitical interference\u201d from the Department for Transport and the Treasury.\nAndrew Haines, chief executive of Network Rail, said he does not believe workers are \u201cclear on what they\u2019re striking for\u201d and argued that the problem is not with the government but the RMT union. He added that he wanted to put the pay offer to RMT members directly in a referendum.\nBut Lynch said RMT members were \u201ccompletely committed to the cause\u201d and would \u201ckeep going\u201d in their long-running dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions \u201cuntil a negotiated settlement is reached\u201d.\n\nStrikes by bus workers across Cheshire, Lancashire, Manchester and Merseyside will be suspended while GMB members vote on a new pay offer, the union and Arriva North West said on Wednesday.\nToday, members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union at Network Rail (NR), workers from 14 train operators, Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA) union members at seven companies and Unite members at NR will strike. This will have a knock-on effect on rail services on Friday morning.\nAlso on Friday, members of the RMT and Unite working on the tube will strike, as well as Unite members on London United bus routes in the capital in a separate dispute over pay.\nOn Saturday rail workers will strike again, along with London United bus drivers, which will also affect Sunday morning train services.\n\nUpdated at 3.45pm BST\n\n\n 10.41am  \n\nAlso last night, we learned that a director at energy regulator Ofgem resigned, accusing it of favouring businesses over consumers with a rule change that will add as much as \u00a3400 to the average UK household energy bill.\nChristine Farnish, a non-executive member of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (Gema), Ofgem\u2019s board, tendered her resignation to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, in early August.\nFarnish said the regulator \u201cgave too much benefit to companies at the expense of consumers\u201d, according to a leaked internal Ofgem announcement. Across the UK\u2019s 27m retail energy customers a \u00a3400 annual bills increase could cost households more than \u00a310bn.\n\n\n\n\n 10.40am  \n\nLast night, it emerged that the billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, one of Britain\u2019s richest people, is interested in buying Manchester United from the club\u2019s beleaguered owners, the Glazer family.\nRatcliffe, who is from Greater Manchester, had previously wanted to purchase Chelsea from Roman Abramovich but has now turned his attention to United.\n\n\n\n\n 10.39am  \n\nTwo-thirds of all UK households will be trapped in fuel poverty by January with planned government support leaving even middle-income households struggling to pay their bills, according to research.\nIt shows 18 million families, the equivalent of 45 million people, will be left trying to make ends meet after further predicted rises in the energy price cap in October and January.\nAn estimated 86.4% of pensioner couples are expected to fall into fuel poverty, traditionally defined as when energy costs exceed 10% of a household\u2019s net income, and 90.4% of lone parents with two or more children.\n\n\n\n\n 10.38am  \n\nWe are getting closer to a cashless society, as more than 23 million people in the UK used virtually no cash last year. Notes and coins will account for just 6% of payments within a decade, a report predicts.\nThe findings, from the banking body UK Finance, are likely to prompt concern that millions of people could be left behind as the shift to a cashless society accelerates.\n\n\n\n\n 10.37am  \n\nAnd Transport for London plans to build 20,000 new homes over the next decade \u2013 I interviewed its commercial property director Graeme Craig.\nCraig is poring over plans for one of London\u2019s biggest new housing developments. The models show a mix of low and high rise buildings, 4,500 homes, alongside cultural venues and parks, which will rise from the rubble of the now demolished Earls Court exhibition centre.\nCraig runs Transport for London\u2019s property arm \u2013 he was appointed its first commercial director more than a decade ago. TfL\u2019s day job is running the capital\u2019s bus and underground network, but it has held on to its land, and 22 years after its creation it remains the third biggest landowner in the capital, after the emirate of Qatar and the mayor of London. It could soon be one of its biggest housing developers too.\n\n\n\n\n 10.35am  \n\nIn other news, Liz Truss would scrap reforms meant to avoid another 2007-style financial crisis by merging three of the UK\u2019s top financial regulators if she becomes the UK\u2019s next prime minister, according to reports.\nThe frontrunner in the Conservative leadership race is said to be preparing for a review of the financial regulators\u2019 responsibilities if she succeeds in beating rival Rishi Sunak, the Financial Times said, citing campaign insiders.\nThat could mean merging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is broadly in charge of overseeing company behaviour and protecting consumers\u2019 financial interests, with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is part of the Bank of England and responsible for making sure banks and insurers are financially stable and are not putting the wider economy at risk.\nThe report suggests the merger would also include the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which oversees the networks that facilitate money transfers, contactless payments and cash machines across the UK.\n\n\n\n\n 10.34am  \n\nBritain\u2019s first double-digit inflation in more than four decades has cast doubts on the plausibility of the tax cuts being promised by Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak during their leadership battle, one of the UK\u2019s leading thinktanks has said.\nFollowing news that the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living rose by 10.1% in the year to July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said higher inflation would mean extra spending on welfare benefits, state pensions and on debt interest.\nThe result of inflation being five times higher than a year earlier would be weaker public finances, making it harder for either of the two hopefuls to replace Boris Johnson to make good on their tax pledges, the IFS said.\n\n\n\n\n 10.07am  \n\nLynch said he will put Sadiq Khan \u201cunder manners\u201d as he accused the London mayor of sacrificing rail workers\u2019 jobs and pension schemes.\nSpeaking at a picket line at Euston station, Lynch said: \n\nSadiq Khan\u2019s got some massive problems because he\u2019s been put under the cosh by a right-wing Government and by the people at the Treasury. They\u2019re holding him to ransom.\nUnfortunately, what Sadiq Khan is doing is offering our members\u2019 pension schemes, and our members\u2019 jobs and terms and conditions, as a sacrifice to the Treasury to get funding. He needs to get into a coalition with the workers and campaign against those cuts.\nWe\u2019re determined to put him under manners as well as [transport secretary Grant] Shapps and the Treasury. We will take on anyone that tries to attack our people.\n\n\n\n\n 9.51am  \n\nSpeaking to Sky News, RMT chief Mick Lynch said his members were \u201ccompletely committed to the cause\u201d and would \u201ckeep going\u201d in their long-running dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions until a negotiated settlement is reached.\n\nNobody can afford to go on strike. They don\u2019t want to be on strike, they want a settlement.\nThey are completely tied into this dispute. I addressed a meeting of thousands of our members last night online and they are totally committed to the campaign that we have got.\nThey understood the issues when they voted for it and they are showing on the picket lines that they are completely committed to the cause.\nWe will keep going until we get a negotiated settlement and our members will decide whether it\u2019s acceptable or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.38am  \nNetwork Rail chief wants to put pay offer to referendum of RMT members\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Haines, chief executive of Network Rail, said he does not believe workers are \u201cclear on what they\u2019re striking for\u201d and argued that the problem is not with the government but the RMT union.\nSpeaking to ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain just after RMT boss Mick Lynch, Haines said the situation is \u201cabsolutely is frustrating\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking for over 18 months. We started these talks actually with Mick\u2019s predecessor and so there\u2019s no lack of readiness to talk. The issue is there are some fundamental disagreements.\nWhere I have a fundamental disagreement is that I don\u2019t think colleagues are clear on what they\u2019re striking for now,\u201d he continued.\nMick mentioned pensions - that\u2019s not an issue for Network Rail. He mentioned job security - we\u2019ve given a guarantee of a job for every single person in Network Rail who wants a job affected by our proposals.\nNow we\u2019ve done our very best to meet those sort of issues but the common factor here is the RMT; it\u2019s not the Government.\nThere are strikes on TfL, there are what, 13-14 train operators? Network Rail? All of those issues have been getting trapped together and I think many people striking are not clear. \nThat\u2019s why we think the way to solve this is to put our offer, a very decent fair offer, to a referendum of RMT members. My staff, and I think that\u2019s the way to solve this.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.28am  \nLynch: UK could be brought to standstill by wave of strikes\n\nLynch warned that Britain could be brought by a standstill by a wave of strikes hitting \u201cevery sector of the economy\u201d.\nThe RMT general secretary stopped short of predicting a general strike, saying: \n\nIt\u2019s not in my power, it\u2019s up to the TUC.\n\nBut he added: \n\nWhat you are going to get is a wave of solidarity action, generalised strike action, synchronised action. And you\u2019ll see it in every sector of the economy, in education, in health, wider parts of the transport system, in all sectors, the private sector as well.\nPeople are fed up with the way they\u2019ve been treated. The British worker is basically underpaid and gets no dignity or respect in the workplace.\nWe\u2019ve got to change that so we get a square deal for everyone in Britain - and that\u2019s what the unions are determined to do.\n\n\n\n\n 8.52am  \nRMT chief warns rail dispute could go on 'indefinitely'\n\nRMT general secretary Mick Lynch has warned that the rail dispute could go on\u201cindefinitely,\u201d as the latest strike by thousands of workers caused travel misery for passengers.\nHe called on the government to end its refusal to get involved in talks over pay, jobs and conditions, as he joined a picket line outside Euston station in London. Only around one in five trains are running across the country because of the walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA unions.\nLynch has written to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, saying:\n\nYour government has made the decision to use taxpayers\u2019 money to bail out private train companies from being liable for revenue lost because of industrial action on the condition the same companies comply with government instructions to hold down pay, cut thousands of safety critical rail jobs, introduce driver only trains and close ticket offices across the network.\n\nLynch said the union had calculated that, including the previous and forthcoming industrial action, more than \u00a3120m of taxpayers\u2019 money had been used to \u201cbail out\u201d private train companies to date. He told the PA news agency:\n\nUsing taxpayers\u2019 money to satisfy the anti-union agenda of the Tory party and seek to break the trade unions is shameful and means the dispute will be prolonged indefinitely as the train companies don\u2019t lose a penny as a result of the industrial action and therefore have no incentive to settle the disputes.\nInstead of waging an ideological war against rail workers, millions of voters would rather that the Government allow for a fair negotiated settlement.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said:\n\nYet again, for the sixth time since June, union leaders are opting to inflict misery and disrupt the day-to-day lives of millions instead of working with industry to agree a deal that will bring our railways into the 21st century.It\u2019s clear strikes are not the powerful tool they once were and union chiefs are no longer able to bring the country to a standstill as, unlike them, the world has changed and people simply work from home.\nAll these strikes are doing is hurting those people the unions claim to represent, many of whom will again be out of pocket and forced to miss a day\u2019s work.\nWe urge union bosses to do the right thing by their members and let them have their say on Network Rail\u2019s very fair deal, which will deliver the reforms our rail system urgently needs. It\u2019s time to get off the picket lines and back around the negotiating table - the future of our railway depends on it.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.57am BST\n\n\n 8.44am  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.38am  \n\nAndy Lord, TfL\u2019s chief operating officer, has apologised to customers for the disruption.\n\nI would like to apologise to our customers for the strike action being carried out by RMT and Unite, which will have a significant impact on the city\u2019s transport network. I understand how frustrating these strikes are and I\u2019d like to remind the RMT and Unite that it\u2019s not too late to work with us, Arriva Rail London and RATP to find a resolution and avoid the huge disruption this action will cause to people\u2019s journeys and to the economy. \nCustomers should check before they travel from 18-21 August, as strike action is impacting different modes of transport each day. For 19 August, we are urging our customers to avoid travelling on the Tube and only travel if essential on the rest of the network. We expect little to no service on the Tube until 08:00 on Saturday 20 August and alternative travel modes are likely to be busy. Please consider walking and cycling if you need to travel.\n\n\n\n\n 8.36am  \n\nTransport for London has reminded customers to \u201conly travel if essential\u201d ahead of tube, rail and bus strikes on Friday, and national rail strikes today and on Saturday.\n\nTube, rail and bus strikes will affect the majority of TfL\u2019s network on Friday 19 August. Customers are advised to avoid travelling on the Tube and only travel on the rest of the TfL network if essential \nStrike action by Unite is taking place on some London bus services in west and southwest London on Friday 19 and Saturday 20 August. Customers are encouraged to avoid making journeys on affected routes (more details on the TfL website) \nThe RMT is also striking on national rail services on Thursday 18 and Saturday 20 August, which will impact some London Underground, London Overground and Elizabeth line services. Customers using national rail services are advised to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary \nDisruption from strike action will continue into the following morning, so customers should check before they travel \n\n\n\n\n 8.22am  \nRMT's Lynch fears solution not possible due to 'political interference'\n\nMick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT), said he fears finding a solution will not be possible because of \u201cpolitical interference,\u201d as rail workers stage another rail strike.\nSpeaking to ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain from Euston Station, he said the union had been working with Network Rail and the train operating companies but \u201cthe gap between us is still there\u201d. \n\nWe\u2019ve got to find a way to bridge that but I fear that because of the political interference that\u2019s happening with the public transport and the Treasury, we\u2019re not able to do that.\nWe\u2019ve also got a dispute tomorrow with London Underground - which is more of the same that the funding from the railway has been cut and that means an attack on rail workers across the land and I think many workers are suffering from that at this moment.\nThey\u2019re not getting a square deal but we\u2019ll keep working with the companies to get a negotiated settlement and as soon as we can do that, will put it to our members and hopefully we can get the railway back providing service the that public needs.\nWe will work those problems through but what we need is the management to have the ability to negotiate and I think this has been has been partially caught up in the Tory leadership election or selection process that they\u2019re going through and I think because those candidates have both both taken a turn to the hard right in this country, it\u2019s very difficult to find the the ability to create a settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.07am  \nIntroduction: Only 20% of UK train services running as 45,000 rail workers go on strike\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets.\nMany train platforms will be eerily quiet today on the first day of new rail strikes. Commuters and other travellers are facing further disruption over the next three days on rail, tube and bus services.\nMore than 45,000 rail workers go out on strike today, mainly from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA), in long-running disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.\n\nBoth sides were talking about the latest strike action on BBC radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning.\nAndrew Haines, chief executive of Network Rail, complained about\n\nslow negotiations, painful negotiations moving over all the place, absolute lack of clarity in what it would take to call the strike off, shifting goalposts. They\u2019re not good and we\u2019re desperate to bring this to a resolution in a way that\u2019s affordable for the country and which avoids the pain for my colleagues.\nThis is the biggest strikes that we\u2019ve seen perhaps for 30 years on the railway and that\u2019s because the employers, myself and the rail operators, supported by the government are saying the economic crisis which Covid has precipitated demands that we modernise.\n\nAlso on the radio, speaking from Euston station, Luke Chester, organising director at the TSSA in London, said the dispute was about pay, job security and working conditions.\n\nTSSA members have not taken industrial action for a very long time in the majority of cases. It\u2019s not something that we take lightly, it\u2019s something that we take seriously.\nWhat we need to resolve this dispute is a pay rise which reflects the cost of living increase that is affecting most people in this country very severely, we need job security \u2026and we require guarantees from the employers that they are not going to rip up people\u2019s contracts of employment, that they are not going to change conditions of working in the way we\u2019ve seen for example at P&amp;O.\n\nHe said the unions were \u201c100%\u201d willing to negotiate on working conditions and working practices, but had not been given the guarantees they were looking for.\n\nWhat\u2019s slightly disingenuous is that we have zero pay offer from the train operating companies, we have zero guarantees around conditions of service and we have zero guarantees around job security.\nSo while we\u2019re talking to Network Rail and Mr Haines and his team are sat round the table with us, and we\u2019re trying very very hard and he\u2019s right it\u2019s painful, we\u2019re trying very very hard to make progress with them. Unfortunately we\u2019ve got 15 train operators who are being told by the Department of Transport by Mr Shapps that they are unable and have no mandate to even sit around and make an offer.\n\nHe stressed that the unions were looking for a \u201cpackage of measures\u201d and that Merseyrail was able to make a 7.1% pay offer, which has been accepted by workers, because it is not controlled by the Department of Transport. Rail managers have also accepted a deal, a package of measures including a pay rise and guarantees around job security. Many were previously paid less than the people they managed, he said.\n\nClearly job security is paramount and many of our members haven\u2019t received a pay rise in three years despite being key workers, despite working through the pandemic. Job security, pay is important and protection of condition of service.\n\nAsian shares drifted lower, following in Wall Street\u2019s footsteps, after the US Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes of its July meeting pointed to a steady course of interest rate hikes ahead.\nThe minutes showed policymakers considered paring back the pace of future rate hikes in line with the slowdown in inflation, but saw \u201clittle evidence\u201d yet that inflationary pressures were easing.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and China\u2019s blue-chip CSI 300 index all lost nearly 1%. Over here, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index dipped 0.2% to 7,497 while Germany\u2019s Dax opened 0.2% higher, France\u2019s CAC was flat and Spain\u2019s Ibex edged up 0.1%.\nThe Agenda\n\n9am BST: Norway Norges Bank interest rate decision (forecast: 1.75%)\n10am BST: Eurozone inflation for July (forecast: 8.9%)\n1.30pm BST: US Initial jobless claims for week of 13 August (forecast: 265,000)\n3pm BST: US Conference Board leading index for July, home sales for July\n\n\nUpdated at 8.58am BST\n"

Thank you for reading.\n\n\n\n\n 4.18am  \nSummary\n\nAs dawn breaks in Kyiv and multiple towns and cities across Ukraine wake to find scenes of destruction, here is where the situation currently stands:\n\nWestern allies have agreed to block Russia\u2019s access to the Swift international banking payment system.

We are praying for the proud people of Ukraine. God bless them all.\nAs everyone understands, this horrific disaster would never have happened if our election was not rigged and if I was the president.\nI stand as the only president of the 21st century on whose watch Russia did not invade another country.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Trump described Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine, where cities have been pounded by Russian artillery and cruise missiles, as \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201cpretty savvy.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.10am  \nSnake Island defenders may still be alive, Ukraine's State Border Guard says\n\nThe Ukrainian soldiers who defended an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment - reportedly telling an officer on board a Russian navy warship to \u201cgo f*** yourself\u201d when asked to surrender, are believed to still be alive according to Ukrainian officials.\nThere were 13 border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, when Russian troops bombed the island on Thursday.\nAll 13 soldiers were believed to have died after refusing to surrender, Ukrainian officials announced.\nHowever, in a recent statement, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said: \n\nWe [have a] strong belief that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island may be alive.\nAfter receiving information about their possible location, the DPSU together with the Armed Forces of Ukraine are conducting work on identifying our soldiers.\u201d\n\nIf you missed our earlier report, you can read it below. \n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.27am GMT\n\n\n 12.36am  \nGas pipeline and oil terminal on fire after attack: reports\n\nReports are filtering in that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv after a Russian attack.\nIn Vasylkiv, central Ukraine, an oil terminal has also reportedly been targeted, according to the National News Agency of Ukraine and later verified by CNN.\nVideo of the fire at the oil storage area southwest of the air base\u2019s main runway has circulated across social media this morning.\nVasylkiv is about 30km, or 18 miles, south of Kyiv.

While your rockets successfully land from space \u2014 Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand.\u201d\n\nMusk responded: \n\nStarlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.\u201d \n\nMusk said on Saturday that the company\u2019s Starlink satellite broadband service is available in Ukraine and SpaceX is sending more terminals to the country, whose internet has been disrupted due to the Russian invasion. Internet connectivity in Ukraine has been affected by the Russian invasion, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country where fighting has been heaviest, internet monitors said on Saturday.\nWhile extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fibre optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology can also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.\nMusk said on 15 January that SpaceX had 1,469 Starlink satellites active and 272 moving to operational orbits soon. \n\n\nUpdated at 12.17am GMT\n\n\n 12.09am  \n\nThe international activist and hacktivist collective, Anonymous, has said Russian state TV channels have been hacked and are broadcasting \u201cthe reality of what is happening in Ukraine\u201d.\nThe group earlier said they launched a cyberattack against Russia in order to support Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted on Saturday that Kyiv was \u201ccreating an IT army\u201d to \u201ccontinue to fight on the cyber front\u201d as Russian forces continue their assault on Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n 12.07am  \n\nHello it\u2019s Samantha Lock with you on the live blog as my colleague Adam Gabbatt signs off.\nIt is 2am in Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv and credible reports from journalists on the ground suggest an air raid is expected imminently.\nPlease feel free to contact me through Twitter for any tips or updates as we continue to cover the crisis unfolding in Ukraine. \n\n\n\n 12.06am  \nSummary\n\n\u2022Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities were being subjected to further attacks overnight, as the Russian assault continued. In Kyiv numerous journalists reported two large explosions, while unconfirmed reports said an airbase south-west of the city may have been targeted.\n\u2022The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, agreed to remove \u201cselected Russian banks\u201d from the Swift payment system. A senior US administration official told the Guardian that Russia has become a \u201cglobal economic and financial pariah\u201d.\n\u2022Germany said it would send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 stinger missiles to Ukraine, in a departure from previous policy. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said the Russian invasion marked a \u201cturning point\u201d. Germany also permitted the Netherlands to send 400 rocket-propelled grenades to Ukraine.\n\u2022Nine countries have now banned Russian aircraft from their airspace, as the repercussions mount for Vladimir Putin. Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and the UK are among the countries to introduce bans, with Germany potentially ready to do the same.\n\n\n\n 11.52pm  \n\nJournalists in Kyiv are reporting numerous explosions around the city, as Russia is believed to be launching a further offensive against the Ukrainian capital.\nCNN\u2019s Tim Lister reported that two large explosions \u201clit up the night sky\u201d southwest of Kyiv, with one of the detonations about 12 miles from the city center, the direction of one of Kyiv\u2019s airports.\nUkrainian officials had warned residents of Kyiv, and other cities, to prepare for airstrikes, which appeared to have begun in the early hours local time. CNN showed video of what seemed to be a large fire near the center of Kyiv, and the Kyiv Post reported that the Vasilkov oil depot, about 10 miles south of Kyiv, was ablaze.\nOksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, acknowledged in an interview with CNN the reports that Vasilkov had been targeted.\n\n\n\n\n 11.32pm  \n\nRussia has become a \u201cglobal economic and financial pariah\u201d, a senior US administration official told the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor Julian Borger.\nSpeaking after western allies announced new financial measures against Russia, including the removal of some Russian banks from the Swift global payments network, the official said the measures were designed to target the Kremlin and individuals tied to the Russian government.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go after their yachts, their luxury apartments their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the west. We will also engage other governments, so as to detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains, and deny these individuals their ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world,\u201d the official said.They said that all 10 of Russia\u2019s largest financial institutions had now been subjected to sanctions \u2013 \u201cholding nearly 80% of the Russian banking sector\u2019s total assets\u201d.As a result, the official said: \u201cRussia\u2019s government borrowing costs have more than doubled to almost 17%. The S&amp;P credit rating agency has downgraded Russia to junk status. Within 24 hours of our actions the demand for cash in Russia spiked 58 fold, according to reports, and the Russian government scrambled to deplete its own resources to try and shore up its banks and its currency. In short, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.\u201d \nRussia has been reported to have $630bn in financial reserves stored abroad, in gold and cash, but the new sanctions would render that fund useless, the official said.\u201cYou heard about fortress Russia, the war chest of $630bn of foreign reserves,\u201d they said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive, but it\u2019s only impressive if Russia can use those reserves. And that means Russia has to be able to sell those reserves and buy rubles to support its currency. And so what we\u2019re committing to do here is to disarm the central bank. And the way we can do that, for example, is by banning US, EU UK, persons from selling rubles to the Central Bank of Russia. That means very simply, the Russian Central Bank can\u2019t support the ruble, full stop, and that means our sanctions will have much greater force.\u201d\nThe US official said the list of Russia banks to be removed from Swift will ultimately be decided by the EU, but said the US would \u201cwork very closely\u201d with European countries \u201cto finalize that list\u201d.\n\n\n\n 10.48pm  \n\nThe news that western allies will ban Russian banks from the Swift global payments network is a break through for the countries that had initially pushed for the ban.\nThe UK and Spain were early supporters of the move to lock Russia out of Swift, the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, but Germany was a key holdout.\nOn Saturday, however, Annalena Baerbock, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, said the country was working on a \u201ctargeted and functional restriction\u201d on Swift. Hours later, the joint statement by western allies, including Germany, was released, with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announcing the measure.\n\nIt is a victory for Ukraine, which had pleaded since Thursday for countries to ban Russia \u2013 foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba going so far as to say that European and US politicians would have \u201cblood on their hands\u201d if they did not.\nBut it remains unclear how widespread the ban will be. The statement from the west referred to removing \u201cselected Russian banks\u201d from Swift, but gave no specifics.\nThe US, like Germany, had initially been sceptical about the Swift ban. The Observer\u2019s economics editor, Phillip Inman, wrote that \u201cone reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious\u201d:\n\nThe head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.53pm GMT\n\n\n 10.24pm  \nWestern allies agree to Swift ban for some Russian banks\n\nThe US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove \u201cselected Russian banks\u201d from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday.\n\u201cAs Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days,\u201d a statement from the leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Canada, and the US said.\nSwift is the world\u2019s main international payments network. Several countries have already expressed support for locking Russia out of the platform, and Germany, which had previously oppose the measure, leant its support earlier today. \nThe joint statement on Saturday made the move official, although few details were given as to when the Swift removal will take place, and which Russian banks will be targeted.\n\u201cWe commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system. This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,\u201d the countries said.\u201cSecond, we commit to imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.\u201d\nThe countries also said they would take measures \u201cto limit the sale of citizenship \u2013 so called golden passports \u2013 that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems\u201d.\nThey also announced plans to launch a \u201ctransatlantic task force\u201d which will ensure sanctions on Russians remain effective.\n\nUpdated at 10.48pm GMT\n\n\n 10.08pm  \n\nDenys Shmyhal, the prime minister of Ukraine, has accused Russia of war crimes and targeting civilian targets, and said Moscow will face a \u201cmilitary tribunal\u201d, CNN reported:\n\nDuring a Saturday news conference, Shmyhal said Russia shelled kindergartens, residential blocks and \u201cbuses with children.\u201d\nFor these crimes, the Russian command will surely see military tribunal. The enemy will surely be punished for killing Ukrainian children. Ukraine will not forgive them for this,\u201d Shmyhal said.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.12pm GMT\n\n\n 10.00pm  \n\nGermany could block Russian flights from its airspace, the German transport ministry said in a tweet.\n\u201c[Transport] minister [Volker Wissing] supports the blocking of German airspace for Russian aircraft and has ordered everything to be prepared for this,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nNine countries, including Czech Republic, Poland and the UK, have so far introduced full or partial bans on Russian flights.\n\n\n\n 9.47pm  \n\nA terrible report from Kyiv, where it seems the Okhmadyt children\u2019s cancer hospital has been struck by artillery fire. Last year the hospital won a grant which enabled it to receive \u201cmodern equipment and a powerful telemedicine centre for minimally invasive surgery\u201d, Lviv Now reported.\n\n\n\n\n 9.29pm  \n\nCredible reports from journalists in Kyiv suggest an air raid is expected imminently. It\u2019s close to midnight in Ukraine, and citizens have endured night time attacks over the last two nights.\n\n\nCNN reporter Alexander Marquardt posted this video from the Ukrainian capital, showing sirens blaring.\n\n\n\n\n 8.59pm  \n\nThe United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Sunday to call for a rare emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports:\nThe vote by the 15-member council is procedural so none of the five permanent council members - Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States - can wield their vetoes. The move needs nine votes in favor and is likely to pass, diplomats said. The special session would be held on Monday, diplomats said.\nOnly 10 such emergency special sessions of the 193-member General Assembly have been convened since 1950.\nThe request for a session on Ukraine comes after Russia vetoed on Friday a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow\u2019s invasion. China, India and UAE abstained, while the remaining 11 members voted in favor. \nThe General Assembly is expected to vote on a similar resolution following several days of statements by countries in the emergency special session, diplomats said. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding but carry political weight.\n\n\n\n 8.57pm  \n\nA tweet from Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, who says he spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskiy today:\n\nSwift is the world\u2019s main international payments network. Several countries are in favor of locking Russia out of the platform, and Germany, which had previously oppose the measure, leant its support earlier today.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.02pm GMT\n\n\n 8.45pm  \n\nMatt Bradley, a foreign correspondent for MSNBC and NBC News, posted this Ukraine defense ministry graphic, which the ministry says illustrates Russia\u2019s military losses in the conflict as of 6am on Saturday:\n\n\n\n\n 8.25pm  \n\nThe Pentagon has strongly denied Russian claims that it assisted Ukraine in a navy operation near Zmiinyi Island.\nJohn Kirby, press secretary for the Pentagon, said the US did not provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance or other support. Russia had earlier claimed otherwise.\n\u201cChalk this up to just one more lie by the Russian ministry of defense,\u201d Kirby said in a tweet.\n\nZmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, was the site of a valiant last stand by Ukrainian soldiers on Thursday. \nThe soldiers died defending the Black Sea island from an air and sea bombardment, and reportedly told an officer on board a Russian navy warship to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d when asked to surrender.\n\n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\nA heartwarming video from earlier today, as a Ukrainian mother embraces her child and then the person who brought him and his sister safely to her across the Hungarian border. \nNataliya Ableyeva was entrusted with the two children by their father who was forced to stay behind to fight for their country. The children\u2019s mother, Anna Semyuk, had travelled from Italy to meet them and take them to safety.\n\n\n\n\n 7.49pm  \n\nNine countries, including Czech Republic, Poland and the UK, have now introduced full or partial bans on Russian flights.\nPoland banned Russian airlines from its airspace on Friday, as did the the UK. Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have each announced partial bans, as has Slovenia.\n\nRussia retaliated by banning UK aircraft from its airspace. It has also restricted flights from Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic.\n\u2022 This map was amended on 27 February 2022 to add Bulgaria as one of the countries that has banned Russian flights. \n\nUpdated at 11.17am GMT\n\n\n 7.42pm  \n\nYouTube has suspended multiple Russian channels, including the state-funded media outlet RT, from generating revenue on the video service, Reuters reported.\nYouTube said in a statement that it was \u201cpausing a number of channels\u2019 ability to monetize on YouTube, including several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions\u201d. It said the move was prompted by \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d.\nVideos from the affected channels also will come up less often in recommendations, Farshad Shadloo, a spokesman for YouTube, said. He added that RT and several other channels would no longer be accessible in Ukraine due to \u201ca government request.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nOne of the more surprising encounters I had in the outskirts of Kyiv today was with 50-year-old Alexander, who was manning a makeshift barricade at the entrance to one village with a group of other locals, brandishing whatever weapons they had.\nAlexander was born and grew up in Russia, then moved to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, but left when Russian-backed forces took over in 2014. Now, he was ready to fight his own former countrymen.\nIf he were to capture any Russian soldiers, he said, he would have nothing to say to them, except to scream \u201cGet out, occupier!\u201d He said logic did not work on Russians because of the propaganda narrative dominant there.\nHe has stopped talking to his relatives in Russia, he said, as they simply don\u2019t understand why he has become a Ukrainian patriot.\n\u201cI spoke to my own cousin two days ago and he doesn\u2019t understand anything. That will be our last conversation. I asked him why are you so cowardly, your country is attacking us with ballistic missiles, your own father is from Ukraine, have you gone insane?\u201d\nHe was, however, realistic about his makeshift team\u2019s chances.\n\u201cOf course, if it\u2019s a tank, in this terrain there\u2019s nothing we can do and we need to run. But if it\u2019s anything less than a tank, we will fight,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n 7.32pm  \n\nRussian troops are approaching Ukraine\u2019s nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia and have aimed their rockets at the site, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said on Saturday.\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, is located in south-east Ukraine. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv.\n\n\n\n 7.13pm  \n\nGermany\u2019s announcement that it will deliver weapons to support Ukraine\u2019s military ends months of resistance from Berlin, despite the repeated calls from the administration of President Zelensky that it needed Germany\u2019s military support.\n\u201cThe Russian attack on the Ukraine marks a sea change,\u201d Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. \u201cIt threatens our entire post-war order. In this situation it is our duty to support Ukraine in its attempts to defend itself against the invasion army of Vladimir Putin. Germany stands closely at the side of Ukraine.\u201d\nGermany is to deliver 1000 tank defence weapons as well as 500 surface to air stinger missiles, from stocks held by the German army, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said. He said the weapons would be delivered to Ukraine as soon as possible.\nThe decision comes as a relief to many Germans who have watched with despair as the events in Ukraine have unfolded in recent days. Many have felt torn between the attempts by Germany to resist involvement in military conflict due to the extent to which the country is still haunted by its own Nazi era, and having to watch the lives of innocent people in a European democracy being ruined by an autocratic kleptocrat who has increasingly been compared to Adolf Hitler.\n\nUpdated at 7.52pm GMT\n\n\n 7.04pm  \n\nRoman Abramovich, the oligarch Russian owner of Chelsea football club, said he will hand over stewardship of the club.\nIn a statement on the Chelsea FC website, Abramovich said:\n\u201cDuring my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the club, whose job it is ensuring that we are as successful as we can be today, as well as build for the future, while also playing a positive role in our communities. \n\u201cI have always taken decisions with the club\u2019s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea\u2019s charitable foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC.\n\u201cI believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the club, players, staff, and fans.\u201d\nAbramovich\u2019s ownership of Chelsea has come under scrutiny as sanctions have been applied to high profile Russian billionaires.\n\n\n\n 6.50pm  \n\nGreece has summoned Russia\u2019s ambassador to its foreign ministry, after it said six Greek nationals had been killed and six others wounded by Russian bombing near Mariupol in Ukraine.\nThe Greek foreign ministry said the bombing took place on the outskirts of Sartana and Bugas villages, and one of those injured was a child, Reuters reported.\n\u201cThe death of our nationals creates grief and anger for this unacceptable Russian attack against civilians,\u201d Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n 6.41pm  \nGermany to send anti-tank weapons and missiles\n\nGermany will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 stinger missiles to Ukraine, the German chancellor said on Saturday.\nOlaf Scholz said the Russian invasion marked a \u201cturning point\u201d, and added: \u201cIt is our duty to do our best to help Ukraine defend against the invading army of Putin.\u201d\n\nGermany earlier permitted the Netherlands to send 400 rocket-propelled grenades to Ukraine. \nThe Netherlands purchased the weapons from Germany, which has a long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones. Reuters reported that countries \u201caiming to onpass German weapons\u201d must apply for approval from Berlin first.\n\nUpdated at 6.54pm GMT\n\n\n 6.30pm  \n\nA total of 2,692 people have been detained in anti-war protests in Russia in the last three days, according to the protest monitoring site OVD-Info.\nAt least 1,370 of them were detained in protests in Moscow, CNN reported.\nMore than 1,800 people were arrested at rallies across the country on Thursday night, after Russians protested on the streets of Moscow, St Petersburg and more than 50 other Russian cities.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.47pm GMT\n\n\n 6.13pm  \n\nGermany has suggested it could support banning Russia\u2019s access to Swift, the world\u2019s main international payments network, after previously opposing the measure.\nAnnalena Baerbock, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, said on Saturday that it was working on a \u201ctargeted and functional restriction\u201d on Swift. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, previously said cutting Russia off from the payments network should not be part of sanctions.\n\nOther countries, including the UK, have proposed locking Russia out of Swift, arguing that the ban would hurt the Russian economy by forcing run-of-the-mill financial transactions to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems.\nHere\u2019s more on Swift:\n\n\nUpdated at 6.15pm GMT\n\n\n 5.45pm  \nSummary\n\nHere are Saturday\u2019s top headlines on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine so far.\n\nFighting continued across Ukraine but the capital, Kyiv, remained in Ukrainian hands when night fell. The death toll as of Saturday morning was at least 198, according to the Ukrainian health ministry.\nPoland said 115,000 refugees have crossed from Ukraine since the invasion began.\nMore EU countries \u2013 including France, Italy and Greece \u2013 have said they would back a ban on Russia using the Swift global payments network in an attempt to pile further pressure on the country after its invasion of Ukraine.\nIt comes after countries including Poland called for stronger sanctions on Russia, and expressed anger at Germany for not backing a Swift ban. But there are signs Germany may buckle to pressure and support a full ban.\nPeople across the world \u2013 including in Manchester, London and Edinburgh in the UK \u2013 took to the streets to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion on Saturday.\nUkraine is increasing pressure on Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, which would block some ships advancing towards Ukraine. Turkey has yet to decide.\nGermany approved the delivery of 400 RPGs to Ukraine by the Netherlands, marking a shift in policy from its previous position of not shipping weapons.\nKyiv is under curfew until Monday. The mayor said: \u201cAll civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy\u2019s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.\u201d\nHungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has said it will support all EU sanctions against Russia and will not block any.\nTwitter said it was aware users in Russia were experiencing restricted access, following Facebook\u2019s similar announcement on Friday.\nCountries including Lithuania, Estonia and Romania blocked airspace for Russian aircraft, with Russia responding by banning Romanian airliners from Russian airspace.\nRussian troops have destroyed a concrete dam in Ukraine that stops water flowing into Crimea, Reuters reports.\nIndia\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi said he would help peace efforts.\n\nThat\u2019s all from me, Jem Bartholomew in London, for today.

Romania earlier banned Russian airlines from its airspace. \nMeanwhile, Lithuania will also close its airspace to Russian airlines at 10pm GMT on Saturday due to the invasion, the government said, blocking access from Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad enclave to Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 5.23pm  \n\nWhen Yuliia Petrenko, a 31-year-old lawyer originally from Donetsk, arrived outside Downing Street for the Stand With Ukraine demonstration on Saturday, she started crying.\n\u201cThe first thing I saw was somebody\u2019s little boy with a sign that said \u2018Putin is killing my gran\u2019, and I just burst into tears,\u201d Petrenko said.\nLike many Ukrainians living in the UK, Petrenko has experienced a wave of emotions in recent days \u2013 fear, anger, frustration, powerlessness, guilt \u2013 as she talks to relatives at home experiencing the arrival of war.\n\u201cAt the minute, my auntie, my cousin and their puppy are in a shelter,\u201d she told the Guardian at the rally. They fled the Donetsk region for Kyiv after Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion. Now, war has followed them. \u201cIt just feels like you\u2019re waiting to wake up from a nightmare,\u201d Petrenko said. \u201cThey can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening, they feel like sitting ducks.\u201d\n\nPetrenko joined hundreds of people in London on Saturday demonstrating their support for Ukraine and revulsion at Russia\u2019s invasion, as diverse crowds expressed their solidarity with Ukrainians and called on western leaders to take stronger action.\n\u201cStop Putin, stop the war!\u201d crowds shouted outside the prime minister\u2019s residence. In a separate demonstration eggs were thrown at the Russian embassy in Kensington in outrage at the military incursion that has already killed hundreds and turned a sovereign nation into a battleground.\nRead The Guardian\u2019s full dispatch from the London demonstration below.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.23pm GMT\n\n\n 5.17pm  \nGermany approves export of 400 RPGs by the Netherlands to Ukraine\n\nGermany has approved the delivery of 400 RPGs to Ukraine by the Netherlands, Reuters reports.\nGermany has faced criticism for refusing to send weapons to Ukraine unlike other western allies. The approval marks a shift in policy.\nReuters has the details from Berlin:\n\n\u201cThe approval has been confirmed by the chancellery,\u201d a spokesman for the defence ministry said on Saturday. The RPGs come from stocks of the German military. \nGermany has a long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, rooted partly in its bloody 20th-century history and resulting pacifism. Countries aiming to onpass German weapons exports need to apply for approval in Berlin first. \n\nMeanwhile, the German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock stressed China\u2019s \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d over the Ukraine conflict in a phone call spoke with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the ministry said on Twitter on Saturday. \n\n\n\n\n 5.09pm  \n\nAn enormous column of tanks are seen moving toward the border near Kharkiv, Ukraine in this CNN report.\n\nNight has fallen in Russia and Ukraine as Ukrainian forces continue to hold the centre of capital Kyiv.

On Friday alone 50,000 were thought to have sought refuge.\n\u201cAt this moment there are 115,000 people who have crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border since the war erupted\u201d on Thursday, Szefernaker said in the border village of Dorohusk, eastern Poland. \nThe UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi tweeted on Saturday: \u201cMore than 150,000 Ukrainian refugees have now crossed into neighbouring countries, half of them to Poland, and many to Hungary, Moldova, Romania and beyond.\u201d \n\nUpdated at 4.02pm GMT\n\n\n 3.56pm  \n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.59pm GMT\n\n\n 3.45pm  \n\nGermany has dropped a block on lethal weapons connected to it being transferred, to allow 400 rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers to be sent from the Netherlands to Ukraine.\nAccording to Politico\u2019s David Herszenhorn, it could represent a major shift in European military assistance. \nUntil now, Germany had a longstanding practice of not allowing lethal weapons it controlled or originally sold to be sent to war zones. Estonia had wanted to send weapons to Ukraine, but because Germany had sold them to Finland, who Estonia had bought them from, Germany had a veto.\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm GMT\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\nOvernight clashes in Kyiv may have been started by \u201cpre-positioned saboteurs\u201d, according to the UK.\nAn update from the Ministry of Defence, its second today, said it believed the initial skirmishes in the Ukrainian capital overnight \u201care likely to have involved limited numbers of pre-positioned sabotage groups\u201d.\nIt said the Russian advance had slowed, with problems probably caused by logistical issues.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm GMT\n\n\n 3.33pm  \nFrance, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Hungary say they would back Swift Russia ban\n\nMore EU countries \u2013 including France, Italy and Greece \u2013 have said they would back a ban on Russia using the Swift global payments network in an attempt to pile further pressure on the country after its invasion of Ukraine.\nCyprus and Hungary also said they would support such a measure.\nThe move, which it is hoped would hit Russian trade by making it harder for companies in the country to do business, is being considered to escalate sanctions on Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday that European and US politicians would have \u201cblood on their hands\u201d if they did not support a ban. The following day, the EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban did not get the \u201cnecessary unanimity\u201d but that it would remain a possibility for future consideration.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.37pm GMT\n\n\n 3.30pm  \n\nAn update on Priti Patel\u2019s cancellation of visas issued to Belarus\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team (see also 2.01pm).\nThe match was in fact scheduled for Monday, not Sunday as she stated in her tweet.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.31pm GMT\n\n\n 3.26pm  \n\nRussia has reportedly sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in the past 24 hours, according to a senior US defence official.\n\nOther developments from Pentagon reporters in Washington:\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.31pm GMT\n\n\n 3.16pm  \nUkraine increasing pressure on Turkey to close straits to Russian warships\n\nUkraine is increasing pressure on Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, after a tweet from President Volodymyr Zelensky was widely interpreted to mean that Turkey had agreed to the closure, reports Ruth Michaelson from Istanbul.\n\nTurkey has so far made no public statements confirming that it has decided to close the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier today, stating that Ankara was attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire.\nThe Russian news agency Interfax said Russia had received no official notification from the Turkish side about the closure of the straits to Russian warships.\nIf Turkey chooses to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Russian warships, preventing them from accessing the Black Sea, it would be a significant move in terms of both cutting off long-term Russian support to their troops in Ukraine as well as a significant show of support to Ukraine.\nA ban would prevent Russian warships normally permanently stationed around the world from sailing into the Black Sea to assist troops in Ukraine. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases.\nThe shipping industry experts Lloyds List pointed out yesterday that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus had already slowed significantly in the past two days.\n\nTurkey\u2019s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as \u201cunacceptable\u201d but described it as a \u201cmilitary operation\u201d rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention, which lays out Turkish control of the straits. The convention defines Turkish control as well as sets limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted. \nThe foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, laid out Turkey\u2019s position regarding the closure of the straits to H\u00fcrriyet yesterday, stating that officials were discussing whether the conflict met the definition of a war under the Montreux convention. If officials decide that the definition has been met, this allows them to block warships from Ukraine and Russia from transiting the straits, although the move is likely to be far more significant for the Russian side.\n\u201cTurkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,\u201d he said, adding that the Montreux convention stipulates that \u201cif there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed.\u201d\n\u201cIf we accept the state of war legally, this process will begin,\u201d he added \u201cSecondly, if we accept the state of war we will prohibit the passage of warships \u2026 but even if we ban them, the Russians have such a right.\u201d\nTurkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict, despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia\u2019s actions. Turkey\u2019s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia\u2019s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdo\u011fan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that \u201cNato should have taken a more decisive step\u201d, earlier this week.\nThe conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits will probably heavily affect Turkey\u2019s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas supply from Russia, and much of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. \n\nUpdated at 3.28pm GMT\n\n\n 3.07pm  \n\nThe British prime minister, Boris Johnson, says he has spoken to the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, this afternoon.\nHe said he thanked him for his \u201cstrong cooperation\u201d on Ukraine and that they discussed the need for \u201curgent action\u201d on excluding Russia from Swift. \n\n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \nKyiv is under curfew\n\nA curfew has come into force in Kyiv until Monday morning.\nIt was initially thought the restrictions to clear the public from the streets would last from 5pm to 8am every day, before the change was announced that it would instead run until 8am on Monday morning without breaks.\nThe mayor\u2019s office said: \u201cFor more effective defence of the capital and security of its residents the curfew will run from 1700 today, February 26, 2022, until the morning February 28.\u201d\nEarlier on Saturday, Kyiv\u2019s mayor, the former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said: \u201cAll civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy\u2019s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 3.16pm GMT\n\n\n 2.56pm  \n\nSweden has become the latest country to refuse to play Russia in men\u2019s football World Cup playoff games later this year.\nThe Swedish FA said it should cancel the playoff games, which are scheduled for March. \nThe Czech Republic are the other team due to be involved in the \u201cpath B\u201d fixtures to decide which nation will be able to play in the Qatar World Cup later this year.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.58pm GMT\n\n\n 2.41pm  \n\nWomen in Dnipro have been making molotov cocktails from polystyrene and beer bottles, which they can use against Russian forces. \n\n\nUpdated at 2.45pm GMT\n\n\n 2.38pm  \nTurkey 'yet to decide' on Russian Black Sea access \u2013 report\n\nTurkey has said it is yet to make a decision on closing its straits between the Mediterannean and the Black Sea to the Russian navy\u2013 despite an earlier claim by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nIt is the first official clarification since Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Turkey had agreed to close the waterways to warships \u2013 which would have been a big defensive boon for Ukraine.\nAccording to Reuters, a Turkish official said it \u201chas not made a decision to close the straits to Russian ships\u201d.\nIf it did happen, a closure would break a convention for Black Sea states that warships are allowed to return to port during wartime. \nThe Russian navy has already been responsible for casualties on the coast of Ukraine and on islands in the Black Sea.\n\nUpdated at 2.46pm GMT\n\n\n 2.24pm  \n\nThe US has announced another $350m of \u201cimmediate support\u201d for Ukraine, bringing the total amount of military aid in the last year to more than $1bn.\nThe secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, said it would help fund defences for Ukraine, including against air and armoured units.\nHe said: \u201cToday, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia\u2019s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the president, an unprecedented third presidential drawdown of up to $350m for immediate support to Ukraine\u2019s defense. This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1bn.\n\u201cThis package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing. It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 2.34pm GMT\n\n\n 2.21pm  \nRussia disputes claim over Black Sea access\n\nThere\u2019s some confusion about the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s claim earlier that Turkey had pledged to close the straits to access the Black Sea.\nRussia, via the Interfax news agency, has said it has had no official notification of the closure. There is speculation that Zelenskiy\u2019s tweet may have been a request for Turkey to take action, rather than a confirmation that it would be in place.\nThe Montreux convention, which governs the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, says ships from Black Sea states will be allowed to return to port during wartime. If Turkey did go ahead and ban warships from the strait, it would break the convention.\n\nUpdated at 2.39pm GMT\n\n\n 2.06pm  \n\nUkraine has denied that it refused negotiations with Russia, as claimed by the Kremlin on Saturday.\nThe head of the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office, Mikhail Podolyak, said it was untrue and that Russia had set out \u201cunacceptable conditions [and] ultimatum demands\u201d.\nOn Saturday Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Putin had ordered a halt to the Russian advance for negotiations, but Ukraine refused them.\n\u201cUkraine, of course, did not refuse negotiations.

If confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre the Russians have seized since their invasion began on Thursday.\nEarlier, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces fired cruise missiles from the Black Sea at Mariupol, as well as Sumy in the north-east and Poltava in the east.\n\nUpdated at 8.28am GMT\n\n\n 7.30am  \n\nThe leaders of Poland, Lithuania and Germany will meet in Berlin on Saturday to discuss sanctions on Russia, the Polish government spokesperson Piotr Muller said on Twitter.\n\u201cAt the initiative of Prime Minister [Mateusz] Morawiecki a meeting will be held in Berlin today. Morawiecki together with the president of Lithuania [Gitanas Naus\u0117da] will hold talks with the German chancellor [Olaf Scholz],\u201d Muller said early on Saturday.\n\u201cThe European Union must immediately adopt a package of ruthlessly harsh sanctions against Russia.\u201d\nMuller did not give the time of the meeting.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.30am GMT\n\n\n 7.26am  \n\nIn this diary of the week in Ukraine, Larisa Kalik documents the Russian invasion and being forced to leave the city she loves. Here\u2019s an excerpt.\n\nThere seemed to be noise, speed, chaos and fuss everywhere, but inside the apartment it was very quiet. Then I heard a sound outside the window, moving at great speed. I thought it was a rocket. The sound seemed to cut through the air; it flew like a whistle and I lay down on the floor in horror. Trembling, I burst into tears. For a few seconds I waited for an explosion, but nothing happened. I still don\u2019t know what it was.\nI gathered myself and looked out of the window. People were wheeling suitcases along the street; a siren sounded; birds flew in flocks. I found a piece of paper and wrote my name, my best friend\u2019s phone number and my blood type. It is still in the pocket of my jeans as I write.\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.05am  \nResidential apartment hit by missile, says Ukraine\n\nUkraine\u2019s state emergency service says a Russian shell has hit a residential building in Lobanovsky Avenue 6, in the centre of Kyiv, reports Luke Harding from Lviv.\nVideo shared by Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s press service shows the missile exploding in a private flat, sending smoke and debris into the living room. It also released images of the aftermath, with the building still burning on Saturday morning and vast damage visible. A large chunk had been torn out of the right-hand corner of the property, with multiple homes destroyed. The number of casualties was unknown. Firefighters helped injured survivors, carrying one woman out on to the street over a sea of debris. \n\n\nIn apparent response to the strike on the building, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister said:\n\nKyiv, our splendid, peaceful city, survived another night under attacks by Russian ground forces, missiles. One of them has hit a residential apartment in Kyiv. I demand the world: fully isolate Russia, expel ambassadors, oil embargo, ruin its economy. Stop Russian war criminals!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.31am GMT\n\n\n 6.47am  \nRussia captures Melitopol \u2013 report\n\nRussian troops have captured the city of Melitopol in Ukraine\u2019s southeastern Zaporizhzhya region, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying on Saturday.\nThe ministry also said Russia had used air- and ship-based cruise missiles to carry out overnight strikes on military targets in Ukraine.\n\nUpdated at 8.31am GMT\n\n\n 6.35am  \nWeapons on the way from partners, says Zelenskiy\n\nZelenskiy is still posting to Twitter, with a follow-up message saying he spoke this morning with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about weapons and equipment \u201con the way to Ukraine\u201d from their partners.\n\u201cThe anti-war coalition is working!\u201d he said.\n\nHere also is a more expansive translation of Zelenskiy\u2019s video statement from about 30 minutes ago.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of fake info telling that I ordered the Ukrainian army to surrender. So, listen here: I\u2019m here. We are not putting our weapons down, we are going to protect our country. Our weapons are our truth, it\u2019s our country, our children and we will protect them.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.32am GMT\n\n\n 6.25am  \n\nThere have been outpourings of solidarity for Ukraine around the world, with protests taking place in cities from Tokyo to New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.33am GMT\n\n\n 6.13am  \n'We will defend our state' says Zelenskiy in new video\n\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted another video from central Kyiv this morning. The 40-second clip appears to be addressing false rumours. According to a partial translation by the Kyiv Independent, the leader says:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there\u2019s evacuation. I\u2019m here. We won\u2019t lay down our arms. We will defend our state.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 8.32am GMT\n\n\n 6.08am  \n\nThe Agence France-Presse news service has been interviewing ordinary Ukrainians who have been handed a rifle so they can help defend their country. \nYuriy Korchemniy, a historian, has never fired an assault rifle in his life. But he joined scores of others and picked up a Kalashnikov when boxes of them were dumped from trucks and handed out to Ukraine\u2019s new volunteer defence units on day two of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\u201cThey gave out the rifles, loaded them for us and here we are,\u201d the 35-year-old said with a slightly sheepish grin.\n\u201cI only know how to shoot single rounds, so my plan is to click this here and switch off the automatic mode.\u201d\nThe Kyiv bridge underpass he was guarding with a handful of other men - some in their 50s \u2013 leads to Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s administrative complex.

Widespread reports of artillery fire and explosions have come from the east, west and south of the city, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces have claimed to have repelled attacks by Russian troops at an Army base near Vasylkiv and a key city road - Victory Avenue. There are reports of casualties but the Guardian has not received confirmed figures.\n\nResidents have been told to stay inside shelters, including underground metro stations and hotel basements.\nThe Kyiv Independent reports air raid sirens in multiple Ukrainian cities this morning, including Lviv, Lutsk, Uman, Vinnytsia, and Rivne.\nUkraine\u2019s former ambassador to Austria, Olexander Scherba, has shared this video purportedly from Odessa. The Guardian has not independently verified this footage, which was also shared by a Ukrainian news outlet.\n\n\n\n\n 4.17am  \n\nThe US has been offering to help evacuate Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, from Kyiv to escape threats to his life, but he has so far refused to leave, the Washington Post reports.\nZelenskiy has pledged to remain, despite awareness that he is Russia\u2019s \u201cEnemy No. 1\u201d and his family number 2.\nCiting US and Ukrainian officials, the Post reported US intelligence agencies, including the CIA director during a visit to Ukraine in January, had warned Zelenskiy of the threat to his safety for several weeks. It cited officials saying intelligence at the time suggested Russian hit teams may have already been in Kyiv.\n\u201cWe have been making him aware not only of the threat of Russian invasion, now a reality, but also the threat to him personally,\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said. \u201cWe stand ready to assist him in any way.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.17am  \nFighting is in the east, west and south of Kyiv, according to multiple reports.\n\n\u201cAll of this is now happening within the city limits,\u201d reports CNN\u2019s Clarissa Ward, but it doesn\u2019t appear to have reached the centre.\nThere are no signs of residential areas being targeted yet, she says, \u201cbut we\u2019re hearing a lot of explosions from many different directions.\u201d\nInterfax Ukraine news agency reports Russian forces have tried to attack an electricity-generating station, while the Ukrainian military says it has repelled an attack on a Kyiv army base, according to Reuters.\nThe Ukrainian government also says it stopped a Russian advancement down Peremohy Avenue - which runs past the Beresteiska metro station, where heavy fighting has also been reported. The Guardian has not independently verified the reports.\nThe assault appears to line up with Zelenskiy\u2019s warning that tonight could see Russia\u2019s attempt to storm the city. Three million people call Kyiv home.\nIn an address to the nation on Friday Zelenskiy said: \u201cTonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 5.04am GMT\n\n\n 4.17am  \nWelcome to our live coverage of the invasion of Ukraine\n\nHello, this is Helen Davidson with our continuing coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here are some of the most recent developments:\n\nExplosions and fighting have rocked the east, west and south of Kyiv, where the Russian assault has continued overnight in a siege apparently aimed at seizing the city. Residents have been taking cover in shelters and underground stations. A woman has reportedly given birth in one station where she had been sheltering with other residents.\n\n\n\u201cThis night will be the hardest,\u201d the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an address. \u201cThis night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMore than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours \u2013 a majority to Poland and Moldova,\u201d said the UN refugee agency head Filippo Grandi, adding that \u201cmany more are moving towards its borders\u201d.\n\n\nThe Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning.\nUkrainian armed forces say they have repelled Russian attacks on an army base and on a major thoroughfare in Kyiv.\n\n\nVladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a \u201cgang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\n\nProminent Russians have joined protests in Russia or spoken out against the invasion, amid at least 1,800 arrests at anti-war rallies. They include pop stars, chat show hosts and newspaper correspondents who have gone public despite the professional and personal risks that come with dissenting from Vladimir Putin.\n\n\nThe US department of defense said a Russian \u201camphibious assault\u201d was launched on Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. \n\n\nA report from the Reuters news agency has suggested it is looking more likely that Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system \u2013 a step that some countries had been reluctant to take. Among other sanctions, The EU and the UK have moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov \u2013 largely symbolic, but it follows appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy who said: \u201cWhen bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.\u201d\n\n\nNato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an \u201cexistential\u201d war between Russia and the west.\n\n\nThe UN security council has voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld.\n\n\nThe Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d from the organisation\u2019s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday \u201cas a result of the Russian Federation\u2019s armed attack on Ukraine\u201d.\n\n\nRussia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year\u2019s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could \u201cbring the competition into disrepute\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.05am GMT\n"

                    "body": "A crime had been committed. That was clear as dawn broke on the burning wreck of Grenfell Tower, in west London, on 14 June 2017. As the death toll climbed, the obvious questions arose: who was responsible? How did a council block in the UK\u2019s richest borough, refurbished just a year earlier, come to be engulfed in flames that swept from its fourth to 24th floor in less than 30 minutes? Why did 72 people die? \u201cWe need to have an explanation of this, we owe that to the families,\u201d said prime minister Theresa May on 15 June 2017. She reached for an investigatory method beloved of governments keen to be seen to be doing something after devastating scandals, disasters and wars: the public inquiry.  The purpose of a public inquiry is to find out what happened and why, and to prevent whatever happened from happening again. Since 1997, there have never been fewer than three public inquiries running at any one time. They tend to be chaired by retired, dependable, white male judges. Between 1990 and 2017, there were more chairs called William or Anthony than women (the forthcoming Covid-19 inquiry chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett is a rare exception). For Grenfell, Theresa May chose a Martin. Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired appeal court judge expert in contract law, picked as his lead counsel, Richard Millett QC, son of a law lord. Millett\u2019s job would be to cross-examine witnesses and marshal a legal army of 39 barristers and 10 solicitors to comb through 320,000 documents. Moore-Bick would have to make sense of it all. As survivors and the bereaved mark the disaster\u2019s fifth anniversary, the inquiry hearings are finally nearing their end. It has been a painstaking and expensive \u2013 \u00a3149m and counting \u2013 attempt to figure out who is responsible, and why. While the public inquiry will not determine civil or criminal liability, Scotland Yard detectives will weigh its evidence when they consider whether to press charges.  Reporting on the inquiry since its first day, I have sometimes worried that with 27 commercial organisations and eight public bodies tangled up in the Grenfell story, the inquiry will never reach a clear answer. In a 21st-century economy obsessed with outsourcing risk, witness after witness has repeated that key decisions were \u201csomeone else\u2019s responsibility\u201d. Fault was found with almost every player, from the architect and the manufacturers to the fire brigade and the building inspectors. But conclusions that share blame and point to system failure will offer the bereaved little satisfaction. Did no one working on Grenfell grasp the possible consequences of their decisions? The suggestion that the complexities of testing materials and following safety standards appear to have overwhelmed the professionals involved in a \u00a310m reclad of a council tower block was unnerving. More disturbing still was how familiar much of the evidence felt from our own working lives. When witnesses, presented with their own email trails, admitted that they \u201cdidn\u2019t open the attachment\u201d that contained some vital instruction or information, it was not a shock. This is business in the 21st century. When the inquiry publishes its final report in 2023, it may find that the fire was a result of the way we work \u2013 deluged with unread emails, constantly overstretched, walled off from the consequences of our actions, barely understanding the whole system. This may ultimately be more chilling than a guilty verdict directed at a person or company. It would be an indictment of our whole economy. Phase one: the night of the fire * * * At 11am on 21 May 2018, in the ballroom of the Millennium Hotel in west London, the inquiry commenced with eight days of commemorations for the dead. Addressing the gathered survivors and the bereaved, Millett gave a sparse timeline of the fire. It broke out just before 12.54am. By 1.29am, flames had risen to the top floor of Grenfell\u2019s eastern facade. At 8.07am, the last surviving resident escaped. Millett promised that the inquiry would examine the physics of the blaze and the firefighters\u2019 response, as well as the decisions that had led the building\u2019s exterior to be clad in flammable material. \u201cBut Grenfell is not a lawyer\u2019s argument or a scientist\u2019s experiment,\u201d Millett said. \u201cGrenfell was home \u2026 a place of refuge \u2026 a joined-up community whose members worked, played, prayed and lived together \u2026 And many of them died together.\u201d The next eight days were extraordinarily painful and moving. There were poems, eulogies, and videos. The family of Mohamed \u201cSaber\u201d Neda, a Kabul-born chauffeur who had lived on the top floor since 1999, played his last phone message. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said in Dari. \u201cWe are now leaving this world. Goodbye. I hope I haven\u2019t disappointed you. Goodbye to all.\u201d Betty Mendy, sister of Mary Mendy, who died with her daughter, the artist Khadija Saye, wept as a statement was read out from a cousin: \u201cI hate night-time because night brings silence, and silence brings tears of sadness, because that\u2019s when I start to remember the blaze of fire.\u201d On the second day, 20 or more survivors left the room as a video about the deaths of six members of the Choucair family showed traumatic images of the tower on fire and residents trapped behind windows. Watching the video, an audience member collapsed.  On 4 June 2018, the inquiry moved to a new venue, a room in a neo-Gothic Victorian building in London\u2019s legal district, Holborn. Counsellors were present in case survivors needed support, but they were far outnumbered by the lawyers for the companies and organisations under investigation. \u201cWe hope,\u201d said Millett in his opening statement, \u201cthat core participants resist the temptation to indulge in a merry-go-round of buck-passing.\u201d The inquiry was divided into two phases. Phase one, which took 16 months, was dedicated largely to the events of just seven hours: the period when the fire was blazing and rescue operations were underway. It heard survivors\u2019 accounts of dense black smoke filling their flats \u201cas if it was shooting in from a hose\u201d and the heartbreaking final 999 calls of people including Mariem Elgwahry, 27, sheltering with six others in a top-floor flat describing how flames were rising and about to burst through their windows. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck\u201d. They all died. Moore-Bick\u2019s initial 800-page report, delivered in October 2019, strongly criticised the response of the London Fire Brigade (LFB), suggesting that it should have recognised sooner that the fire was out of control, reversed the \u201cstay put\u201d instructions it had initially issued to residents, which had been based on the presumption that fire could not spread throughout the building, and instead ordered an evacuation. In the wake of the phase one report, Dany Cotton, commissioner of the LFB, quit. She had angered the bereaved by telling the inquiry she \u201cwouldn\u2019t change anything we did on the night\u201d. But many survivors were unsatisfied with the blame being placed on the fire brigade. Many firefighters had shown bravery. Wasn\u2019t the bigger crime wrapping the tower in cladding that burned like petrol? Phase two: The cladding and \u2018horse meat masquerading as beef lasagne\u2019 * * * It was phase two, which began in January 2020, that the bereaved hoped would give them the answers they needed: from the council, the builders, the companies that made and sold the combustible cladding panels, and the fire safety \u201cexperts\u201d who had approved them. Millett began with bad news. With minor exceptions, every written statement he had received from participants in the inquiry sought to explain how \u201cwhat happened was, as each of them would have it, someone else\u2019s fault\u201d. To the Grenfell survivors, it was a familiar refrain. Many had spent years before the fire having their concerns dismissed as someone else\u2019s responsibility by the very same organisations that were now under investigation. The \u201cmerry-go-round of buck-passing\u201d was spinning. Yet the mountain of emails, spreadsheets and reports mined from these organisations\u2019 servers painted a different picture. The inquiry would hear that, in 2016, two employees of the insulation manufacturer Kingspan had a jokey text exchange about the claims it was making for its material\u2019s fire performance. One said: \u201cAlls we do is lie in here.\u201d In late 2020, after a four-month delay because of Covid-19, the inquiry began its examination of the companies that supplied the materials used in Grenfell\u2019s lethal cladding system. As the days passed, the hearings became increasingly infuriating for the bereaved, as witness after witness seemed to struggle with memory and insisted someone else was responsible. Jonathan Roper, who worked for Celotex, the company that made most of the flammable insulation foam used in the 2016 recladding, was a rarity. He spoke candidly about the strategies, employed in the name of profit, that contributed to the use of dangerous materials on high-rise buildings.  In May 2012, Roper, then 22, had graduated in business studies from the University of East Anglia, and just weeks later arrived at Celotex for his first job. He had no training in building regulations and knew nothing about insulation. The firm was soon taken over by French multinational Saint-Gobain, which was demanding an increase in profits, 15% of which was to come from new products. The plan was to simply rebrand the rigid foam insulation panels it already made and target the high-rise housing market, which was worth around \u00a310m a year. Celotex wanted Grenfell as a \u201ccase study\u201d. Grenfell, a 24-storey, 40-year-old tower, was going to be wrapped in a cladding system to improve its thermal performance and appearance. The method, widely used on new and refurbished blocks, involved fixing boards of 10cm-thick rigid foam insulation to the original concrete walls and overcladding them with rainscreen sheets pre-fabricated from thin aluminium sandwiched around a core made of a plastic called polyethylene. These sheets are known as ACM PE (aluminium composite material with polyethylene). Part of Roper\u2019s job \u2013 his annual bonus depended on it \u2013 was to assure the market that Celotex\u2019s product, known as RS5000, was safe to use like this. The difficulty was that while builders prefer to use plastic foam boards because they can be cheaper, thinner and easier to install than non-combustible mineral wool, they also burn and release hydrogen cyanide, a gas more toxic than carbon monoxide. Celotex would need to reassure builders that using their product would not break safety regulations. Roper began by looking at how Celotex\u2019s main rival, Kingspan, had managed to get its insulation certified for use on tower blocks. Kingspan, which provided 5% of the insulation on Grenfell tower, had secured a large slice of the foam-insulation market, the inquiry heard, by mastering England\u2019s byzantine regulatory system for building materials. For years, official guidance had simply banned the use of combustible insulation on tall buildings. This was a safety-first approach \u2013 after all, upper storeys were hard to escape from and fire brigades were usually not equipped to reach higher floors. But in 2006, in response to manufacturers\u2019 lobbying and a wish to cut carbon emissions through better insulation, the government had permitted the use of material with limited combustibility in specific types of constructions, which had to be proven safe in full-scale tests. These tests, often conducted at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in Watford, involved mocking up a section of wall to scale, and setting fire to it under laboratory conditions. This testing system was deeply flawed. The full-scale tests were complex; the results could be misinterpreted; the certificates were issued by a third body and could be drafted in ambiguous ways. All this meant that it was possible to make, market and sell material that was dangerous \u2013 but that seemed, on paper, totally safe. In 2006, Kingspan changed the chemical composition of its leading insulation, Kooltech K15, but continued to sell it on the basis of a previous test. In 2007, a full-scale test of the new version became a \u201craging inferno\u201d, said an internal report. (At the inquiry, Kingspan\u2019s lawyer played this down, citing a test witness who did not agree the fire was \u201cspectacular\u201d, and said there was no scientific evidence to show its fire performance was any worse than the previous version.) But Kingspan continued to sell the new version for use on hundreds of high-rise residential blocks in the UK and obtained certificates that said the new product could be safe on tall buildings if used in specific combinations with other materials. Kingspan said it should have done a fresh test but didn\u2019t in the \u201chonest belief that the change in technology would not make any material difference to the fire performance\u201d and it conducted a test after the Grenfell fire which supported that. By autumn 2015, the inquiry heard, Kingspan had sold K15 for use on at least 230 UK high-rise blocks. This was the market Celotex was chasing. In his evidence to the inquiry, Roper said that he had tried to warn company bosses that their product was not safe to use behind most types of cladding \u201cbecause in the event of a fire, it would burn\u201d. But he had come to think they \u201cwanted to launch into this [high-rise residential] market regardless\u201d. It made him very uncomfortable. In February 2014, Roper had stood alongside the BRE\u2019s \u201cburn hall\u201d manager, Phil Clark, for a first test of Celotex\u2019s insulation in a full-scale wall. A big clock ticked in front of the rig. If the flames got to the top within 30 minutes it was bad news. It failed in 26 minutes. For the retry, Celotex did something shocking. It included bands of fire-retardant magnesium oxide board at strategic intervals to slow the spread of flames through the mocked-up wall. The material was concealed behind the exterior cladding panel and would be invisible to onlookers or in photos. \u201cThe rig was being over-engineered to achieve a pass,\u201d said Roper, and pass it did. The inquiry asked how Celotex could have done this without the BRE realising. It turned out Celotex arranged for the materials to be delivered to the BRE and supplied its own contractor to put up the test structure. Surprisingly, this was in line with normal practice. The test was then overseen by BRE technicians. On day 71 of the inquiry, Roper told Millett that he was \u201cnot in any doubt\u201d that Clark, the burn hall manager, knew what was being tested. Questioned three months later, Phil Clark denied any knowledge of Celotex\u2019s ruse. \u201cWe\u2019re not there to police necessarily every nth degree of what they\u2019re doing there,\u201d he told the inquiry. He said he couldn\u2019t recall any magnesium oxide panels being delivered, and speculated that the delivery note \u201cmay have got lost\u201d. While he normally knew which materials were involved in a test, \u201cif you\u2019ve got somebody who\u2019s going out of their way to deceive, then there was a possibility they could do that\u201d. The true independence of the BRE, which charged manufacturers \u00a325,000 a time to conduct full-scale fire tests, was frequently examined at the inquiry. \u201cWe have a lot of clients who spend a lot of money with BRE,\u201d Stephen Howard, its director of fire testing told Millett. \u201cWe don\u2019t wish to upset any of them.\u201d The BRE told the inquiry its testing complies with British standards and that companies testing materials are contractually bound to provide accurate information. The BRE had been deceived by Kingspan and Celotex, it claimed, and rejected \u201cany suggestion that it was complicit\u201d in either Kingspan or Celotex\u2019s \u201cmisleading promotion\u201d of their products. Lawyers for the bereaved saw it differently, and accused the BRE of acting as \u201ca product champion, opening the gateway to sales for these deadly materials\u201d. The whole certification process was \u201cpositively dangerous since it creates a veneer of respectability which, in some cases, serves to conceal test results obtained by dishonest testing,\u201d they said. Celotex admitted that a number of staff had engaged in \u201cunacceptable conduct\u201d but said that its current management only learned of this after Grenfell. The company said it has since changed its procedures and culture. Celotex also insisted there was no evidence the professionals working on Grenfell\u2019s cladding had been misled by its product literature \u201cin any relevant respect\u201d, and said that the BRE knew about the fire-retardant boards. It said that when it ran tests of the insulation used just as the marketing brochures suggested it had initially been tested, it found it could be safely used, at least according to building regulations at the time. In the winter of 2014-15, preparations for the recladding of Grenfell Tower were in full swing and the refurbishment team agreed to buy 660 of the panels \u2013 at close to a 50% discount. The inquiry had found the foam insulation \u201ccontributed to the rate and extent of vertical flame spread\u201d. Simon Crawford, one of the architects on Grenfell, later described it as a case of \u201cmasquerading horse meat as beef lasagne\u201d. The combustible panels: \u201cwe have to keep [this] VERY CONFIDENTIAL!!!!\u201d * * * Two years and nine months into the inquiry, in February 2021, the spotlight shifted to Arconic, a multinational giant that, among other things, makes aluminium sheeting for safety-conscious aerospace companies such as Airbus and Boeing. Its French subsidiary, Arconic Architectural Products SAS, had made and supplied the plastic-filled panels on Grenfell tower that Moore-Bick\u2019s interim report had judged as the \u201cprincipal reason why the flames spread so rapidly\u201d. How had Arconic come to sell material for housing that burned so easily? Five of Arconic\u2019s key executives were called for questioning. To the dismay of the bereaved, three did not show up, invoking an anachronistic French law that can prohibit French citizens from disclosing commercial information to foreign judicial proceedings. There was nothing the inquiry, or the British foreign office, could do. Even the French government said it didn\u2019t believe the law applied, but still the executives didn\u2019t come. Key among the absentees was Claude Wehrle, the firm\u2019s head of technical sales support. In 2009, according to disclosed emails, he shared with colleagues images of a burning tower in Bucharest \u201cto show you how dangerous PE [polyethylene] can be when it comes to architecture\u201d. In 2010, Wehrle had told a sales colleague that when PE panels were formed into a cassette, as they were at Grenfell, they were combustible. He added, \u201cwe have to keep [this] VERY CONFIDENTIAL!!!!\u201d Five years later, Wehrle warned colleagues that the exact panels Arconic sold for use on Grenfell were \u201cDANGEROUS on facades\u201d and urged that \u201ceverything should be transferred to FR [fire-resistant] as a matter of urgency\u201d. It didn\u2019t happen. Lawyers for the bereaved claimed that Arconic targeted sales of PE in countries such as the UK known to have more lax regulation. There was a commercial incentive to continue selling the combustible version: it was cheaper and more profitable than the fire-resistant alternative. Stephanie Barwise QC, counsel for bereaved and survivors, said: \u201cArconic knowingly and deliberately prioritised profits over safety.\u201d  After his no-show was announced, Wehrle was doorstepped by reporters at his home in Alsace and insisted he would not be giving evidence following legal advice. \u201cI don\u2019t see what it can bring to those unfortunate people,\u201d he said. \u201cI did my job in my country and that\u2019s it. I am really upset by this. It brings me great, great sadness.\u201d Millett and his team were able to reconstruct much of Arconic\u2019s role from internal emails. One of the most staggering recorded an Arconic marketing manager telling colleagues about a 2007 seminar delivered in Oslo by a cladding expert. The expert had said that fires involving ACM PE cladding \u2013 and there were several before Grenfell, in Qatar, the UAE, Australia and France \u2013 produce huge clouds of toxic smoke that can kill within three minutes. The expert had even posited a scenario of 60-70 people killed by a fire fuelled by ACM PE panels \u2013 and asked: \u201cWhat is the responsibility of the ACM supplier?\u201d Shocked, the Arconic marketing manager said the business seemed so risky that it might be time to only sell fire-retardant panels. At the inquiry, Arconic refused to take responsibility for what happened at Grenfell. It said the supply of the panels was lawful and it had taken steps to encourage the use of fire-retardant products before the disaster. Grenfell\u2019s professional team ought to have known the risks of using the PE version with other combustible materials, it claimed. Arconic\u2019s lawyers argued that it couldn\u2019t guarantee the performance of its products once fabricated, and that it had no choice over the materials with which ACM was used. It also cited evidence that builders should have known it was \u201ceasily ignited and combustible\u201d. Stephen Hockman QC, argued that \u201cThe tragic outcome of the Grenfell Tower fire resulted not from the use of ACM PE but from the way in which it was used,\u201d adding that it would be \u201cdeeply unfair to try to pin the blame on the manufacturer\u201d. It was a position that enraged the bereaved. Yet if Kingspan, Celotex and Arconic provided the fuel, the spark would come from political choices made closer to Grenfell Tower \u2013 inside the smart offices of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) in the affluent south of the borough. The council and the rebel residents: \u2018We were treated as sub-citizens\u2019 * * * Rock Feilding-Mellen is the son of hippy aristocrats. His mother, Amanda Feilding, Countess of Wemyss and March, is best known for trepanning her own skull in 1970 in pursuit of altered states. Educated at Winchester and Oxford, and with a family stately home, his world was far from that of the Grenfell Tower residents. He became a councillor aged 27, and by 2013, aged 33, he was deputy leader with control of housing, property and regeneration in a borough containing some of the most expensive land in Britain. It gave him oversight of the Grenfell Tower refurbishment. Many councils had seized on property development, some to fill holes left by government cuts, others out of free-market instinct and desire to boost home-ownership. A prime potential redevelopment zone in Kensington and Chelsea was Grenfell Tower and its surrounding 1970s estates. This had long been the genteel borough\u2019s poorest area. In the 1930s the Labour MP Sir Stafford Cripps lamented: \u201cOf all the slums in England, those in north Kensington are the most tragic.\u201d Inside the council, the tower was assessed as one of the borough\u2019s \u201cworst property assets\u201d and \u201ca poor cousin\u201d that \u201cblights\u201d the surrounding area. From a purely financial perspective, the council viewed Grenfell as worthless. Laura Johnson, director of housing, wrote a memo to the effect that anything spent on Grenfell was money down the drain. In 2009, a plan commissioned by the council had recommended demolishing Grenfell and replacing it with a mix of social and private housing, including more than 1,000 homes for sale. So in 2012, when the refurbishment scheme for Grenfell was proposed, Feilding-Mellen asked if it would \u201cobstruct\u201d the \u201cbigger, longer-term potential\u201d. Another councillor remarked that a proposed \u00a36m refit might seem \u201ca terribly nice thing to do\u201d but it was wrong to divert money from elsewhere in the borough. (In 2013, Kensington and Chelsea had \u00a3241m in reserves.)  Despite being the council member for housing, Feilding-Mellen only recalled \u201cskimming\u201d London Fire Brigade documents that spelled out councils\u2019 \u201clegal duties to keep properties safe from fire\u201d. He did, however, have strong feelings about the colour of the cladding. \u201cThe lime green should be less neon and a more pastel shade of green/turquoise or a deeper/darker British racing green,\u201d he wrote to the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation. The inquiry heard there had been deep antagonism between the council, the tenant management organisation and some of the residents, such as Ed Daffarn, who had lived on the 16th floor since 2001. He was one of a group that the landlord\u2019s contractor branded \u201crebel residents\u201d. Daffarn\u2019s complaints included the quality of works, failure to involve residents in the choice of cladding and windows, and the low budget. In November 2016, Daffarn predicted on the Grenfell Action Group blog: \u201cOnly an incident that results in serious loss of life\u201d would expose \u201cthe malign governance of this non-functioning organisation\u201d. The tenant management organisation blocked staff from accessing his blog on its work computers. Daffarn wasn\u2019t alone. Lee Chapman, 22nd-floor resident and secretary of the tower\u2019s leaseholder association, told the tenant management organisation three months before the disaster that they were \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the risk of fire. \u201cAs residents in a so-called \u2018social housing block\u2019, we were treated as sub-citizens,\u201d he told the inquiry. \u2018Flowing responsibility\u2019: the uses of subcontracting * * * Within days of the fire, a handful of project documents from the tenant management organisation were leaked. They contained discussions about changing the cladding panels in order to cut costs. Switching from non-combustible zinc panels to ACM represented a saving of \u00a3293,368. Feilding-Mellen said in a statement to the first phase of the inquiry in October 2018 that he had been told the tenant management organisation was hoping to save money by switching the cladding, but said he didn\u2019t know anything about the technical properties of the cladding options. Kensington and Chelsea maintains it was reasonable to expect it was \u201centering a market that was sufficiently well regulated to ensure that there was minimal risk\u201d. Instead, it found itself in \u201ca world full of potential snares and pitfalls\u201d. It also said it was obliged to seek good \u201cvalue for money\u201d when spending taxpayers\u2019 funds. Feilding-Mellen told the inquiry he supported the refurbishment, and said the council would have increased the budget \u201chad we been told it was necessary to ensure residents\u2019 safety\u201d. He said he will \u201clive with the memories of that early morning for the rest of my life\u201d. Millett\u2019s team revealed numerous instances of money trumping safety. In tendering for the contract, the tenant management organisation had stretched public procurement rules in ways that \u201cmay have resulted in the selection of both an architect and a contractor ill-equipped to carry out the project,\u201d lawyers for the bereaved alleged. When the Grenfell refurbishment contract was tendered, three builders submitted bids. However, one firm, Rydon, was advised to find extra savings of \u00a3800,000. The tenant management organisation\u2019s director of regeneration, Peter Maddison, had previously worked with some of the executives at Rydon and the tenant management organisation held an \u201coffline\u201d meeting with the firm to discuss potential savings. Rydon won the contract but had underquoted for the job by more than \u00a3200,000. It then had to recoup its costs in other ways. Simon Lawrence, Rydon\u2019s project manager, set out to persuade the planners that ACM PE was not an inferior product to the more expensive zinc. \u201cI\u2019m giving it my hardest sales pitch as we speak,\u201d he emailed colleagues. \u201cCome on the Essex-boy patter!\u201d On the occasions that doubts were raised about the contracts, they tended to be ignored. In September 2014, the tenant management organisation\u2019s project manager, Claire Williams, emailed Lawrence requesting \u201cclarification of the fire retardance of the new cladding\u201d. There is no record that Lawrence answered her email. In the same year, the tenant management organisation\u2019s legal department queried whether Rydon\u2019s \u00a39.2m bid was \u201cabnormally low\u201d. When quizzed about this by Millett, Peter Maddison replied: \u201cThe project was delivered on budget and that\u2019s the best sign as to whether or not the price was the correct price.\u201d \u201cWell, Mr Maddison,\u201d responded Millett, \u201cthe fact that the project was delivered on budget is not of great assistance to us given that we know what happened to the building.\u201d Contractually, Rydon was \u201cfully responsible in all respects for the design\u201d but insisted the overwhelming responsibility for the loss of life lay with Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan the cladding manufacturers, who, it alleged, acted with \u201csystematic deceit and dishonesty\u201d. Rydon was at the top of a chain of subcontracting that allowed it, in the words of one executive, to \u201cflow \u2026 responsibilities\u201d to others. For example, it subcontracted a facade company, Harley Facades, which in turn subcontracted another firm to do the work on site. Professionals repeatedly relied on others for assurances. Rydon subcontracted the job of making good the areas around the new windows with non-combustible mineral wool, but in the end, it was done with combustible foam instead. Simon O\u2019Connor, a site manager, didn\u2019t bother to check whether the subcontractor was proposing to use the right material. \u201cIt probably was my job, and no, I don\u2019t recall doing it,\u201d he said.  The testimonies suggested carelessness and a reluctance to take responsibility, but also a lack of confidence on the part of people working in supply chains too complex for them to understand. A number of those questioned suggested that ultimately, companies relied on the council\u2019s building control inspectors to ensure compliance. In the case of Grenfell this was John Hoban, who had seen his department at Kensington and Chelsea shredded by austerity. From 2013-2017 it had lost 10 experienced building inspectors and gained a single new graduate. At one point, Hoban had 130 projects to oversee. He told the inquiry he trusted the designers and fire engineers on Grenfell, and admitted to not checking drawings and specifications properly, and not understanding the combustibility of materials. \u201cAre you saying because Grenfell had a team of experienced professionals, you were less ruthless and rigorous than you would have been had they not been there?\u201d asked Millett. Hoban denied he was \u201crelying\u201d on them, but said: \u201cI can only do so much in a day, Mr Millett, and I have to prioritise my work, I have to make judgments.\u201d In tears, he said he was heartbroken for \u201cthe children, the brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, fathers, mothers, grandfathers, grandmothers\u201d who died. The government\u2019s role and Cameron\u2019s red-tape bonfire * * * In February 2022, the final phases of the inquiry began. After 237 days, it was finally time for ministers and Whitehall officials to take their place in the witness box. Many following the inquiry wondered if the government\u2019s failure to simply ban ACM PE panels on tall buildings was ultimately to blame. The inquiry heard about numerous warnings that had been missed or ignored. After a cladding fire at Garnock Court in Scotland in 1999 destroyed flats on nine floors and resulted in one man\u2019s death, a House of Commons select committee concluded that cladding systems should either be entirely non-combustible or justified through full-scale tests. Owing to a loophole left in the revised building regulation system, however, this made little practical difference. Shortly afterwards, a government survey of high-rise cladding elicited a warning from construction firm WS Atkins about the risk of flame spread, but nobody in government followed up.  But perhaps the most shocking revelation concerned the government\u2019s response to a fire at Lakanal House in Southwark in 2009 that had killed six people. In 2013, the coroner for the inquest, Frances Kirkham, complained that the building regulations guidance to constructors about fire safety was a \u201cmost difficult document to use\u201d. It failed to answer straightforward questions about what materials were allowed and needed to be reviewed. The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, promised a new version by 2016-17, but it never came. Millett wanted to know why. At the time, David Cameron\u2019s coalition government had embarked on a \u201cred tape challenge\u201d \u2013 a drive to cut business costs to help an economy still limping out of the financial crash. \u201cAll those unnecessary rules that place ridiculous burdens on our businesses and on society \u2212 they must go, once and for all,\u201d Cameron told ministers in April 2011. By January 2012 he wanted to \u201ckill off the health and safety culture for good\u201d.  \u201cWe found ourselves spending an inordinate amount of time looking at how we could deregulate,\u201d Anthony Burd, an official tasked with securing building safety in Pickles\u2019 department, told the inquiry. Brian Martin, who had been the civil servant in charge of official building regulations guidance, told Millett: \u201cMinisters were very focused on avoiding anything that might impact on the economy in a negative way.\u201d Pickles was the most senior of five ministers to appear before Moore-Bick and Millett, on day 261 of the inquiry. He did not endear himself to those watching, complaining to Moore-Bick that if the questions went on much longer he might have to cancel the \u201cinternational guests coming in to see me\u201d, and telling Millett that \u201cI urge you to use your time wisely\u201d. Pickles insisted he had accepted the Lakanal coroner\u2019s recommendations, but his letter to the coroner in May 2013 pushed back against her call for a review of regulations. It said: \u201cmy department is committed to a programme of simplification. However, the design of fire protection in buildings is a complex subject and should remain, to some extent, in the realm of professionals.\u201d After Pickles stood down in May 2015, the Conservative peer James Wharton was appointed as a junior minister with responsibility for building regulations. In September of that year, Conservative MP David Amess warned Wharton that there were problems with the government\u2019s fire safety regulations that had \u201clife safety implications\u201d that needed to be dealt with \u201cimmediately\u201d. Wharton agreed to meet Amess, but when they met, he told him that his principal objective was reducing red tape. There was plenty of evidence that civil servants and politicians knew the risks. The inquiry saw how, in April 2015, Brian Martin had written a \u201cworry list\u201d that included the need to review the fire safety guidance. Under the heading \u201cwhat happens if we don\u2019t act?\u201d he had written: \u201cBigger building fires!\u201d After a dramatic ACM PE cladding fire in Dubai in January 2016, Martin emailed colleagues commenting it makes \u201cnice shiny buildings\u201d but \u201cwhen it gets exposed to a fire, the aluminium melts away and exposes the polyethylene core. Whoosh!\u201d The ministers and civil servants questioned by Millett were often combative, contradictory and vague. However, there was one moment that stood out among the hours of evasion. When Millett asked Martin, \u201cIs there anything you would have done differently?\u201d, the civil servant was visibly distressed. \u201cI find it difficult to express how sorry I am for what\u2019s happened to the people of Grenfell Tower,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThere were a number of occasions where I could have potentially prevented this happening.\u201d Supply chains and the violence of distance * * * Moore-Bick\u2019s final report, expected next year, is likely to nominate multiple wrongdoers. After that, the police may pursue criminal charges, including corporate manslaughter. But the significance of the inquiry goes beyond this. It has exposed, in almost unfathomable detail, many of the most dangerous tendencies that underpin contemporary society. There was David Cameron\u2019s crusade against red tape, as if regulation exists only to impede business; a council that couldn\u2019t decide if it was a housing provider or a property developer; and a wider mania for subcontracting that doesn\u2019t so much devolve responsibility as evaporate it. Watching the inquiry unfold, I was struck by two troubling side-effects of the ever-increasing complexity of modern supply chains. At Grenfell, the endless subcontracting gave executives a false sense of security that others would make up for their shortcomings in effort and expertise. Meanwhile, the proliferation of organisations involved in even a relatively straightforward building project seemed to leave workers feeling powerless to act against wrongdoing. Perhaps most disturbing of all was that the question of wrongdoing did not even seem to occur to many of the people working in those complex supply chains. Time and again, witnesses seemed nonplussed when asked to consider their responsibilities or confronted with the results of their actions. Most saw themselves as just one part of a long chain, who couldn\u2019t be expected to see the whole picture, never mind bear responsibility for it.  The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman once wrote that violence in our age is defined by distance. Summarising Bauman\u2019s idea, the journalist Daniel Trilling has written that this means not only physical distance, \u201cbut the social and psychological distance produced by complex systems in which it seems everybody and nobody is complicit. This, for Bauman, works on three levels. First, actions are carried out by \u201ca long chain of performers\u201d, in which people are both givers and takers of orders. Second, everybody involved has a specific, focused job to perform. And third, the people affected hardly ever appear fully human to those within the system. \u201cModernity did not make people more cruel,\u201d Bauman wrote, \u201cit only invented a way in which cruel things could be done by non-cruel people.\u2019\u201d This was not the whole story of the inquiry. Such heedlessness does not apply to all of those whose actions were under scrutiny. Some individuals seemed to bear greater direct responsibility. But Bauman\u2019s theory may explain why so many people knew the dangers and still did nothing to prevent disaster \u2013 and why, until we change the way our society is organised, it might happen again.  \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 June 2022. An earlier version said the recommendations of the 1999 select committee were \u201cignored\u201d; the government did agree to introduce a stronger testing regime for cladding but has been criticised in particular for leaving a loophole in the building regulations system, namely the permitted use of \u201cClass 0\u201d materials that were rated only for surface combustibility.

                    "body": "  9.57am    The Senate is pushing ahead debate on the government\u2019s climate change bill. It won\u2019t pass, they\u2019ll just get through the speeches today and then presumably move onto amendments tomorrow.      9.46am    Indigenous SA senator rejects cancel culture and supports cashless debit card in first speech A Liberal party senator has warned Australians against pigeonholing all Indigenous people, AAP reports. The South Australian senator Kerrynne Liddle has used her first speech to call for a rejection of unanimity and cancel culture. The Indigenous senator spoke in support of the cashless debit card and warned against the government banning its use on the basis of a \u201cphilosophical objection\u201d. \u201cRather than unleashing the rivers of alcohol and drugs and with it more associated abuse and neglect, how about ridding our communities of the miscreants, pretenders, controllers and rescuers; leave them nowhere to hide or thrive,\u201d Liddle said. Liddle says she wants to avoid an undue amount of focus on race.  I get angry when others seek to define me firstly or only by race and I know from experience it is getting worse. I was not an Indigenous news reporter, nor an Indigenous business woman or an Indigenous company board director. First and foremost I am just me. So I look forward to objecting loudly to navel-gazing, paternalism, box ticking, quasi-consultation, silly reporting that returns little value and ideas that fail to provide evidence of change.  The senator also called for a more tolerant society where people aren\u2019t afraid to admit when they\u2019ve got it wrong. \u201cI want our country to think different, act different, demand different, push away from the pressure of sameness, the rejection of discourse, the perils of group think,\u201d she said. \u201cReject over-policing of language, cancel culture and aggressive social media commentary. All that does is conjure ridicule, creates fear and stifles our potential to do better.\u201d Liddle says she stands for smaller government, accountability, strong borders, equality and a measured approach to tackling climate change \u201cthat considers diversity and how people are affected differently and disproportionately\u201d. \u201cCommon sense beats the emotional, the hysterical on every issue, every time,\u201d she said.  Updated at 9.49am BST    9.40am   The day that was, Wednesday 7 September  That\u2019s where we will wrap up the blog for today. Midwinter Ball is under way and I am sure we will see more about that tomorrow. In the meantime, here\u2019s what made the news today:  A bill to incentivise pensioners to downsize by reducing the impact of selling and buying a new home on an income support recipient\u2019s rate of pay was introduced into parliament. Timor-Leste will likely join Asean in 2023, 12 years after applying, president Dr. Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta says. Peter Dutton accused the government of asking Australians to sign up to an Indigenous voice to parliament \u201csight unseen\u201d. The federal government will introduce legislation into parliament next week to establish an anti-corruption commission. The 18-year-old driver of a ute involved in a single-car crash that resulted in the deaths of five teenagers in Buxton, south-west of Sydney, on Tuesday night was arrested by police on Wednesday. He is assisting with inquiries. Covid-19 cases will be reported weekly after this Friday, as the country recorded at least 62 deaths from the virus.  Amy will be back on deck tomorrow. Until then.  Updated at 10.09am BST    9.38am    From what I can tell from a quick check of the socials none of the big four banks have announced they\u2019ll pass on the interest rate hike announced by the RBA yesterday.  I assume that\u2019ll come in the next couple of days.     9.35am    A duck rescue!      9.24am    Ombudsman reports multiple issues regarding telecom interception laws The Commonwealth Ombudsman\u2019s annual report on how Australia\u2019s telecommunications interception laws operate found a string of problems with some of Australia\u2019s most prominent law enforcement agencies. AAP reports they include agencies not record-keeping correctly and warrants being issued by ineligible authorities. Victoria police was found to have poor record-keeping practices. It told the ombudsman that in two of its three areas that use the telecommunications data powers, it destroyed documents explaining why it had applied for intercepts after they were sent. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission was told it needs to do more to show its officers meet requirements for telecommunications data authorisations. The ombudsman said the commission had acted on requests with \u201cinsufficient information\u201d. The report also found carriers provided data not authorised for disclosure, with some agencies showing \u201cpoor or no data vetting\u201d procedures to ensure it is identified. This meant some agencies received data they were not legally entitled to without realising it. SA police attempted to redact the information it had received outside of the range of time it was supposed to, but the report found it had \u201cused an ineffective redaction methodology\u201d. The ombudsman found a number of issues regarding Journalist Information Warrant controls, designed to protect journalist sources in the public interest while also being able to investigate wrongdoing. The ombudsman suggested Queensland\u2019s Crime and Corruption Commission seek legal advice when its requests potentially related to journalists. The report said Tasmania police accessed phone data without taking sufficient steps, with the organisation unable to provide records showing it had considered warrant controls before requesting and accessing data.  Updated at 9.30am BST    9.11am    Words from the frontlines of the childcare protests around the nation Here\u2019s some voxpops from the childcare protest today via AAP: In Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square thousands of workers donned blue tops and chanted as they marched through the city on Wednesday. Kiki Fairbrass, an educator, said she was sick of being thanked with food and cupcakes for working during breaks, leading working bees on weekends, staying back late and cleaning centres. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for recognition because as educators we need qualifications to work in this industry,\u201d Fairbrass said.  Daniel Scoullar, a parent, attended the rally with his three-year-old son Elliot as a gesture of gratitude. \u201cEarly childhood educators are part of the glue that holds everything together, enables people to go to work, supports kids\u2019 development and just doesn\u2019t get that level of respect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not treated like the skilled profession that it is.\u201d Caterina Mamone has been an early childhood educator for 14 years and says she\u2019s sick of being described as a babysitter. \u201cWe are basically raising other people\u2019s children from zero to five,\u201d she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to think, \u2018what happens if I leave the sector and find a job with better stability?\u2019\u201d Leading operators Goodstart Early Learning and G8 Education expressed support for workers staging the shutdown. Thrive Early Learning owns eight centres around Sydney and backs the industrial action, but questioned how wages can rise without costs being passed on to families. \u201cI fully support educators as they use the only tactic they feel works to get governments to listen. But I wonder how the increased pay will be funded?\u201d Thrive\u2019s founder, Carl Elassal, said. Goodstart Early Learning expected workers from about 200 of its centres to attend rallies. \u201cWe know that a lot of parents have opted to pick up their children early so that more of the educators can attend their rallies. A lot of parents are very supportive,\u201d Goodstart\u2019s head of advocacy, John Cherry, said.  Updated at 9.19am BST    9.00am    A couple of photos here from our photographer Mike Bowers from the Senate this afternoon. The first is SA Liberal senator Kerrynne Liddle giving her first speech, and the second is the finance minister, Katy Gallagher in conversation with independent senator David Pocock. Pocock has been in discussions with the government to pass the government\u2019s landmark climate change bill.       8.52am    Climate-conscious shareholders have asked a major Queensland coal mining company to reveal how it will meet net zero emissions by 2050, AAP reports. The group of 117 New Hope investors have filed shareholder resolutions demanding the company outline how it will manage down coal assets. The resolutions, backed by environmental finance campaigning organisation Market Forces, were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on Wednesday. \u201cShareholders request the company disclose, in subsequent annual reporting, information that demonstrates how the company\u2019s capital expenditure and operations pertaining to coal assets will be managed in a manner consistent with a scenario in which global energy emissions reach net zero by 2050,\u201d the resolution states. It comes as New Hope teeters on the brink of expanding Queensland coal mining operations after mining leases were approved for stage three of the New Acland open-cut coal mine. The controversial project is an expansion of the existing mine about 35km northwest of Toowoomba on the Darling Downs. It will lift New Acland\u2019s output from 4.8m tonnes to 7.8m tonnes a year, and extend the mine\u2019s life for 12 years to 2034. The New Hope Corporation has spent more than a decade fighting for the progression of the project, against the resistance of environmental groups and landholders. The project now has a final hurdle to clear as New Hope waits for water licence approval from the Department of Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water.  Updated at 8.56am BST    8.40am         8.32am    Covid statistics to be distributed weekly instead of daily Here\u2019s a bit more on the daily Covid case numbers becoming weekly across Australia at the end of this week, via AAP. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, said the decision was in line with expert health advice. \u201cThe move is supported by chief health officers and will ensure high-quality, accurate information is provided that sheds more light on Covid dynamics,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis approach will bring national reporting in line with all the state and territories and support the analysis of Covid trends nationally and globally.\u201d The weekly data will include new cases and deaths, along with hospitalisations and ICU admissions. \u201cThe national report will be expanded to include trends-based analysis and oral antiviral uptake,\u201d Butler said.  Updated at 8.41am BST    8.22am   NSW Police arrest 18-year-old driver in fatal crash south-west of Sydney  NSW police have arrested the 18-year-old ute driver in the crash that resulted in the deaths of five teenagers in Buxton south-west of Sydney on Tuesday night. Three teenage girls and two teenage boys died at the scene, while the driver was treated by paramedics and taken to Liverpool hospital for testing. After he was released from hospital he was arrested in Bargo at 1.50pm on Wednesday and taken to Narellan police station. Police say he is assisting with inquiries and have called on anyone with dashcam footage or information from social media to come forward.  Updated at 8.26am BST    8.05am    Midwinter Ball tonight The parliament is starting to wind down: everyone is now turning their focus to the Midwinter Ball, which is being held in spring, because the election and subsequent parliamentary break meant it couldn\u2019t actually be held mid-winter. Mike Bowers will be taking photos of the entrants, so we will bring you some of that. I\u2019ll let you know how everyone is feeling tomorrow morning (I am not attending, so I will be as fresh as a tired, trampled daisy). Josh Taylor will take you through the evening, though. Thank you so much to everyone who joined me today and for all your comments. A big thank you to the moderators who are going above and beyond keeping the blog comments open for as long as possible, and of course to the Guardian brains trust, especially Bowers, Sarah, Paul and Josh B for keeping you all informed. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning \u2013 until then, take care of you Ax  Updated at 8.19am BST    7.58am    Greens say addressing poverty is a \u2018moral obligation\u2019 Here is a little bit more on the senate inquiry into poverty we told you about a little earlier: Greens senator Janet Rice, chair of the community affairs references committee, asked for the group to investigate \u2018the extent and nature of poverty in Australia\u2019.   The Albanese Labor government has hosed down prospects of any significant rise to welfare payments in the October budget. Rice called out \u201cyears of inaction by successive governments\u201d on poverty.  When 5.1 million Australians are barely scraping by on Centrelink payment rates below the poverty line, and millions more are facing cost of living pressures and the crushing stress that goes with it - something is deeply wrong and needs to be fixed,\u201d she said.\u201cThis inquiry will hold wide-ranging hearings across the country, enabling people who have been forced to rely on woefully inadequate payments to have their voices heard, and take that evidence into Parliament.\u201d\u201cWhen millions of people in this wealthy country are one car-breakdown or dental emergency away from total financial ruin, surely as elected representatives of the people, it is our moral obligation to do something about it.\u201d    Updated at 8.07am BST    7.55am    Christian church leaders appeal for food aid donations A delegation of 40 Christian women is meeting with senior ministers, shadows, cross benchers and minor party MPs in Canberra today. They are urging the Australian government and others to support a $150m emergency relief package for hunger hotspots in the Horn of Africa, Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan. There are more than 49 million people in 45 countries at risk.Somalia is at the forefront of the crisis, with UN aid chief Martin Griffiths overnight giving a \u201cfinal warning\u201d that we are in the \u201clast minute of the 11th hour\u201d to save lives. Covid, climate (devastating drought) and the war in Ukraine are behind the food crisis.The Uniting Church\u2019s rev Amel Manyon, who came to Australia as a refugee in 2008 and became first South Sudanese female minister in the Uniting Church, is among the delegation. She said: \u201cMany children have died, women, vulnerable people - they died because they went searching for something to eat. I\u2019m asking the government in Australia, please do something now. People are dying because of hunger and it\u2019s not good for us to sit and listen to their stories and not do something.\u201d  Updated at 8.03am BST    7.47am    Antipoverty Centre welcomes inquiry into povertySpokesperson and JobSeeker recipient Jay Coonan:   We are glad to see today\u2019s news about a new poverty inquiry, almost exactly 50 years on from the establishment of the inquiry led by Ronald Henderson that went on to produce Australia\u2019s poverty line. The need to better understand poverty in this country is clear, but the need to immediately increase Centrelink payments is clearer. Poor people have been failed too many times by government inquiries, and there is no time to wait. The low rate of welfare payments is killing people. Poor people are dying by suicide at extraordinary rates. People are being forced to stay in or return to violent homes. We are skipping meals and healthcare at an unprecedented rate and the cost of living crisis is only making things worse. This inquiry is no excuse for the government\u2019s continued refusal to act urgently on the rate of income support payments. They must give up playing politics with our lives and increase all payments to at least the Henderson poverty line before more people die.   Updated at 7.55am BST    7.45am    Motion for Senate inquiry into poverty accepted The Greens senator Janet Rice\u2019s motion for a Senate inquiry into the nature and extent of poverty in Australia has been accepted by the Senate. The inquiry will look at: The extent and nature of poverty in Australia with particular reference to:  The rates and drivers of poverty in Australia; The relationship between economic conditions (including fiscal policy, rising inflation and cost of living pressures) and poverty; The impact of poverty on individuals in relation to:   employment outcomes, housing security, health outcomes, and education outcomes   The impacts of poverty amongst different demographics and communities; The relationship between income support payments and poverty; Mechanisms to address and reduce poverty; and any related matters    Updated at 7.53am BST    7.43am    The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, visited the high school of the young Buxton car crash victims on Wednesday afternoon.  He spoke with teachers at Picton High and expressed his condolences at the private meeting.  He also placed flowers inside at the school.      7.33am    So you know, things seem to be going great for some       7.22am    Ban on personal meat imports from 70 countries As of midnight, meat imports from 70 countries were banned by the Australian government as part of the ongoing foot-and-mouth disease response. Murray Watt tells the ABC:  What we have introduced from midnight was a complete ban on the personal importation of meat products from the 70 countries that currently have foot-and-mouth disease. There has obviously been some calls that we should be banning meat products brought in from Indonesia, but this ban goes wider than that and picks up every country that currently has foot-and-mouth disease.    Updated at 7.31am BST    7.16am    Security committee appointments announced The Parliament of Australia has appointed members to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) in the 47th Parliament. This is one of the most coveted committees in the parliament: The PJCIS has elected Peter Khalil as its Chair. The members are: \u00b7 Peter Khalil MP [Chair] \u00b7 Andrew Wallace MP [Deputy Chair] \u00b7 Karen Andrews MP \u00b7 Senator Simon Birmingham \u00b7 Senator Raff Ciccone \u00b7 Andrew Hastie MP \u00b7 Julian Hill MP \u00b7 Senator James Paterson \u00b7 Senator Marielle Smith \u00b7 Senator Jess Walsh \u00b7 Josh Wilson MP   Updated at 7.23am BST    7.07am    Jane Hume questions cost of living  You can add Jane Hume to the list of Coalition MPs wondering how and why the Labor government hasn\u2019t fixed everything from the last 9 years of Coalition government in the three months since it took power. Hume adds:  They have crab-walked away from their signature policy to reduce the cost of living which was a $275 reduction in energy prices. Minister Bowen has come out and said that he stands by the modelling but that\u2019s weasel words, if you can\u2019t commit to the promise to reduce energy prices by 2025  I mean\u2026   Updated at 7.12am BST    7.02am    Government Covid reports to become weekly This was a national cabinet decision \u2013 daily covid reporting will move to weekly from Friday. NSW Health announced: Routine reporting of Covid-19 information, including case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths, will happen on a weekly basis from Friday 9 September. The move from daily reporting to weekly reporting was agreed to by all state and territory health ministers and will begin to be applied from this week. In addition to its weekly reporting of Covid-19 information through the NSW Health website and social media accounts, NSW Health will continue to provide comprehensive, detailed reporting and analysis of the latest Covid-19 data and developments in its weekly respiratory surveillance reports. A wide range of Covid-19 information and advice is also available on the NSW government website.  Updated at 7.08am BST    6.54am    The Senate is once again being \u2026 the Senate Lidia Thorpe was asked to withdraw comments she said was calling out racism in response to one of SA Liberal senator Alex Antic\u2019s speeches, which was bemoaning the \u201cthreat\u201d of critical race theory (another culture war import from the US) and \u201cvictimhood\u201d. Thorpe wants to know why calling out racism has consequences but saying things like Antic did, does not. Thorpe released a statement:  This parliament punishes Blak women for calling out racism, yet there are no consequences for being racist in the Senate chamber. I am not safe in this workplace. The Jenkins report talks about the \u2018intersection of multiple forms of discrimination and harassment (...) on the basis of gender, age, race, disability and sexual orientation\u2019 as well as the importance of everyone feeling \u2018safe and welcome to contribute.\u2019 If I didn\u2019t withdraw, I could have been kicked out of the Chamber for a day and The Greens would be down a vote. They cut off my microphone and told me to withdraw my comment. How is that creating a workplace where everyone is \u2018safe and welcome to contribute\u2019?! It\u2019s \u2018unparliamentary\u2019 to call out racism, but not unparliamentary to be racist. Racism is a disease in this country. It\u2019s violent and literally makes people sick. We need an anti-racist code of conduct for MPs to be accelerated and implemented to stop this from happening in the first place.    Updated at 7.05am BST    6.38am    Breaking into politics for my South Australian peeps (hi QuietHillbilly) \u2013 there is a weather warning you should know about:      6.36am    Images from question time Mike Bowers was in the chamber for QT (again, brave man) and here is what he saw: Everyone in this photo seems happy with the extra questions the crossbench are getting.  And then the photo of Anthony Albanese turns into Kermit the Froganese, see? (Either that or Keith Pitt doesn\u2019t know how to open the PDF)  The hook crew being as inspiring as ever  Peter Dutton may have just realised who his shadow treasurer was:  Kristy McBain explaining her share divestment for the fifth time.   Updated at 6.42am BST    6.10am    Question time ends And not a moment too soon, because that was getting dire.  Updated at 6.11am BST    6.05am    Question on interest rates and mortgage repayments I miss who asks this question (sometimes I look in the chamber and see people I swear I have never seen before in my life) but someone from the opposition asks:  According to the latest data, the average Australian mortgage is just over $600,000. $760 more a month is paid by the ordinary Australian. The impact of interest rate rises was just $95, was the prime minister misleading the house?  Anthony Albanese:  The average mortgage is ... $330,000 and a 50-basis-point increase adds up to $409 [a month]   Updated at 6.08am BST    6.01am    Richard Marles answers a dixer on Aukus The defence minister gives an update on his recent trip to the UK and how everyone is on board with progressing the deal. Andrew Hastie then gets up to associate the opposition with Marles\u2019s comments, but forgets you can\u2019t do the political attack when you are speaking on indulgence.  It was the former Coalition government who struck Aukus in September of last year, the biggest defence and foreign policy since Anzus and we want to see Aukus realised as quickly as possible. In fact, strategic circumstances demand exceptional leadership from the minister and we will be [holding] them to account\u2026  Milton Dick gives him the big Nooope   Updated at 6.05am BST    5.56am    Ted O\u2019Brien to Chris Bowen: My question goes to the minister for climate change and energy. Does a departure of the former chief executive of Snowy Hydro indicate that the minister is unwilling to accept frank and fearless technical advice as to the viability of the Kurri Kurri plant operating with hydrogen from day one? Bowen:  No.   Updated at 6.01am BST    5.53am   Anti-corruption commission legislation to be introduced next week  Helen Haines to Mark Dreyfus:  Ahead of the anticorruption legislation being introduced next week, will the government also establish an independent whistleblower protection Commissioner as a one-stop shop to support and protect the brave people who will report corruption to the anti-corruption commission and across the entire public sector?  Dreyfus:  I thank the honourable member for the question. And say that I am looking forward to introducing to the parliament next week the legislation to establish an anti-corruption commission, fulfilling a commitment that our government made at the last election and, indeed, at the election before that and just to remind those opposite, a commitment those opposite made at the last election and at the election before that and it is long past time that this parliament moved to establish a national anti-corruption commission. Going to the question, the government is of course committed to ensuring that Australia has an effective framework to protect whistleblowers, frameworks to protect whistleblowers are critical to supporting integrity, the rule of law. I am very proud that when we were last in government, we brought to this parliament the public interest disclosure act 2013 and equally I am able to say I was very disappointed to say the statutory inquiry which we legislated when passing that, to place and was carried out by an eminent Australian, Philip Moss, who reported to the former government at the end of 2016 and there the report sat. Mr Moss made a number of very sensible suggestions for the amendment to the act and regrettably the government simply sat on those recommendations by Philip Moss. I have said, since coming to office, that we have picked up Mr Moss\u2019s report and looking hard at the recommendations that he has made and I am hopeful to bring the parliament in coming months amendment that the public interest disclosure act will pick up and almost certainly will need to update the recommendations that Mr Moss made back in 2016, whether or not it goes to a whistleblower protection commissioner is something that the government is still considering. I know the member for Indi has an interest in this and in her anti-corruption commission bill she had in the last parliament, she had provided for a whistleblower protection commissioner and that is why we are taking that particular idea very seriously indeed.    Updated at 5.59am BST    5.46am    Kate Chaney to Chris Bowen: The government recently approved the release of 10 new fossil fuel exploration sites, demonstrating that it is willing to continue developing fossil fuel projects into the future. This is incompatible with Australia breaching its 43% emissions reduction target and incompatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. If new oil and gas projects are to be developed, which sectors are to be expected to cut their emissions more deeply to make room in our current budget for these projects? Bowen:  Thank you, Mr Speaker and the honourable member for her question. And thank you for your engagement on this issue in a constructive way. Our Climate Change Bill should come if all goes well, capacity set and become the Climate Change Act of Australia and will in trying 43% emissions reduction into the law of land which sensible honourable members of the crossbench group agreed with. As the member knows, 42% is to be achieved by the whole country but we have policies that achieve that on a sector-by-sector basis. Safeguarding mechanisms when it comes to bigger matters, particularly oil and gas for the separate mechanisms are an important way for oil and gas emissions to be produced and we have a discussion paper out there and all honourable members are encouraged to make a constructive suggestion. If you have any. I know until members of the crossbench will do that because it is a sensible project and process to go through including how new proposals are dealt with the second mechanisms and we are open to constructive advice. The minister for resources did release for actuation and invitation to explore those areas. An annual process that occurs every year. The minister resources had done that in an appropriate way.    Updated at 5.52am BST    5.41am    Jim Chalmers follows that up with this conclusion to his dixer on the electric vehicle legislation:  It says something about the bubble of bumbling incompetence that the shadow Treasurer floats around in. He has the nerve to ask a question of the prime minister and immediately after the minister explained that we are trying to get a tax cut through this parliament. This is the captain blunt approach, to pretend they love lower taxes until they are asked to vote for it. They pretend they like lower taxes until it interferes and collided with their outdated obsolete out-of-touch ideology. There is no reason to oppose this legislation except that they physically cannot bring themselves to support a good idea. This is what we see from the leader of the leftovers, a pretty clear pattern from the boycott of the jobs and skills summit and he\u2019s now boycotting the future. They are the Liberal party, led [by someone] dead set on division, defined by his denial, his division and his destruction. Fronting the dregs of a departing government that the Australian people ditched for a reason.   Updated at 5.48am BST    5.37am    It\u2019s Angus Taylor time This question comes after Chris Bowen takes a dixer on the opposition opposing the government\u2019s legislation on reducing the taxes on electric vehicles as well as increasing their supply. Taylor\u201d  Yesterday the prime minister refused to rule out increasing taxes on Australian families. With Australian facing five consecutive increases in interest rates, will the prime minister rule out any new or higher taxes on Australian families, businesses or retirees by Christmas?  Anthony Albanese: Well, it pays to pay attention to what happens in Question Time, because, I thank the member for Hume for his question. I sat to the member for Hume that at half past two, you shouldn\u2019t necessarily ask the question that was decided upon whenever tactics met this morning, because we just had in this chamber an answer about taxation. And when we on this side of the House have legislation before the Parliament right now to lower taxation, and those opposite in their party room yesterday imagine the discussion, some of them would have said, followed the deputy leader of the Liberal party and said well, it\u2019s not really relevant because they don\u2019t exist, these electric vehicles, electric utes, they don\u2019t exist, but others had said no, we have to hold the line, we had to try, we have blown out $1tn of debt, why would we worry about these issues? And then they came down to, no, remember if we vote for... Milton Dick:  Relevance, will he rule out taxes on Australian families, businesses and retirees. That is not an indication or invitation to speculate about what occurred in the Opposition party room.   Albanese:I am completely addressing taxes, Mr Speaker. What we have done is we have legislation to lower taxes, to lower taxes for individuals but to lower taxes as well for businesses by changing the FBT positions. Those opposite have made a decision to support high taxes, to support high taxes. It is not surprising they were all over the shop, the end, the end key killer point raised by one of those opposite, perhaps the member for Hume, was we can\u2019t do this because if more people have electric vehicles, it will end the weekend. No one wants to do that. No-one wants to do that. That is the former government\u2019s position and quite clearly with the current opposition\u2019s position is as well. What they need to do is recognise the fact that there has been a change. This is a government that is about efficiency, about delivering for Australian families, about delivering for Australian workers, about shaping the future, not being shaped by it.   Updated at 5.47am BST    5.31am    I don\u2019t know who is on the opposition\u2019s tactics team, but they might need to have a bit of a rethink     5.29am    Sussan Ley to Anthony Albanese:  The government has renounced changes to medicines cheaper that the Coalition actually promised in April, celebrated a pension increase that occurred automatically due to skyrocketing inflation and released a half-baked version of the Coalition\u2019s plan to allow pensioners to work more days, which expires in just nine month\u2019s time. With Australians facing a cost of living crisis now, why doesn\u2019t the prime minister have any new initiatives to provide cost of living relief before Christmas?  Albanese:  Well, I do thank the deputy leader of the Liberal party for that question, and I note the number of interviews that have been by the deputy leader of the Liberal party where she has said in response to the number of initiatives that the new government has taken, why didn\u2019t they do it 100 days ago? Why didn\u2019t they do it 100 days ago? Why didn\u2019t they do it 100 days ago? (Ley seems to be saying she\u2019s flattered Albanese is watching her interviews) We\u2019ve got to have something to amuse ourselves when Parliament is sitting . If only the deputy leader of the opposition had been in a position to do something at one stage. If only! If only in April that the deputy leader of the opposition refers to, she was in a position to do something. Or maybe in 2021, or 2000, or 2019, or 2018 or any of the other times that the member was sitting in the cabinet, in between of course that sabbatical that she took from being in the cabinet. But what we have done, what we did of course in the election campaign is go to Perth in our election campaign and we are now a decrease from $42.50 to $30 for pharmaceuticals on the PBS and what we did was we didn\u2019t just announce it, we did it. We did it. And we\u2019ve introduced the legislation here today. We promised cheaper childcare and that legislation will be here of course next week. Of course the policy that they announce during the election campaign was less than what we announced and was about nine years too late. But I\u2019d just find it beyond belief that there is no self reflection at all in saying why didn\u2019t you do things earlier when you sat on these benches for nine years and watched cost of living pressures rise at the same time as you were putting downward pressure on wages, at the same time as low wages were a key feature of the economic architecture.  So the truth is that those on the side of the chamber now, the new government is acting based upon the commitments that we made. Those opposite our lamenting the fact that they didn\u2019t do anything to alleviate cost of living pressures in their nine long years in office.    Updated at 5.39am BST    5.26am    Tony Burke takes a dixer on multi-employer bargaining  This part of Burke\u2019s answer passes the dixer report test:  I had only today land on my desk, and this is how much red tape is in the system at the moment where businesses want to bargain together \u2013 today, [papers] land on my desk from 22 different employers employing dental hygienists, dental therapists and health therapists, needing my permission to be allowed to bargain together. So the workers want to bargain with these employers, the 22 employers want to bargain together, and yet we have a redtape system where it has to go all the way to the minister, where I have to take into account six different conditions and there is actually a seventh condition which is anything else you want to consider, and after I\u2019d give permission for it, which I did today, it then has to go to the Fair Work Commission for them to give permission as well. Those opposite will publicly rail against redtape, unless it is red tape that holds wages back. In Victoria, we had early education centres, Victorian, we had 17 not-for-profit early childhood centres that wanted to be able to bargain together but the current system didn\u2019t allow them. These are all workplaces with about 20-30 staff, overwhelmingly female workplaces and not one of them with its own HR department. Like those opposite who wanted to do the bullying of different small business organisations recently saying how dare you try to get rid of redtape and try to be able to together, might take notice that small businesses don\u2019t have their own HR department. If they want to be able to have an agreement that is tailor-made for their style of business, multi-employer bargaining is the only way they are going to have that sort of opportunity and yet in that case, everyone of those centres, all 70 of them, had to individually go through the process of registering an agreement, making their own applications, but what was the outcome? You were able to get 16% above the award for those workers and for the employers to be able to get these sorts of agreements they want. If we can get those sorts of outcomes without the red tape that gets wages moving and it is good for business.   Updated at 5.33am BST    5.22am   PM criticises opposition over nuclear push  This QT is all over the place. Peter Dutton:  My question is to the prime minister \u2026 looked the Australian public in the eye and promised on 97 occasions that you would reduce their power bills by $275. Yesterday the minister for climate change and energy said the statement of $275 by 2025. We stand by our commitment. Can the prime minister confirm that the Labor party has now recommended without qualification to a $275 power bill price?  Anthony Albanese:  I thank the leader of the opposition for his question. I have said absolutely consistently on every single day they have it here that we stand by the modelling that we did, the reputed modelling. And the modelling, what it showed, was that our plan that includes rewiring the nation, making sure that if you make the grid 21st century-ready, if you actually enable renewables to fit into the energy grid through the integrated systems plan that has been developed by the Australian energy market operator then what you will do is promote investment in renewables which is the cheapest form of energy. And am modelling showed very clear what the impact of that would be both on households but it also showed about the modelling of what it would do for businesses as well. This is not a complex question. That is why the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Council of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation, the Clean Energy Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, the Investors Group \u2013 when it comes to energy, all of these disparate groups have all been united in supporting the position that we took to the election and the reason why our plan is because it will result in lower prices, because if you have a shift in the energy mix towards cheaper energy as opposed to more expensive energy then you lower energy prices. But what those opposite want to do is say after 22 failed plans, they want to go towards nuclear energy. That\u2019s what they want to do. And they can say, if you like, where the plants are going to be. I\u2019ll look forward to their review, letting us know... And we know they have to be near urban areas and water.   Updated at 5.30am BST    5.13am    Simon Birmingham questions Penny Wong on Solomon Islands election funding The shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, has asked a trio of questions to Penny Wong about Australia\u2019s offer of assistance for Solomon Islands\u2019 election, and its criticism of the public disclosure of the offer as an assault on its democracy and sovereignty. Wong replied:  Our support for an election held when the Solomon Islands determines that election will be is an offer that is respectful of sovereignty.\u201d  Birmingham noted his question \u201cdidn\u2019t query the merits of financing the election\u201d but was specifically about the \u201cthe public disclosure of offer of assistance, and whether it was conveyed to Solomon Islands\u201d. Wong said the government had sought to \u201ctransparently answer questions from journalists\u201d.   Updated at 5.23am BST    5.13am    Mark Butler was giving a dixer on the government\u2019s PBS announcement when he said:  As the prime minister said, this morning we met Greg, a terrific fellow who told us about his family experiences. Down at Capital Pharmacy in Kingston. A terrific pharmacy run by Sandra, and the prime minister and I were able to stock up on some of the items and [things] that middle-aged men like us need to get going every day. Greg told us... The Coalition begins giggling like private school boys who just heard the word \u201cvagina\u201d, and Milton Dick has to call for order Peter Dutton:I want to give our support to hear more detail about what the minister is speaking about, what colour the tablets are. The frequency in which you take them. Happy to hear the details.  Lols :\\Butler:  Happy to have a private meeting with the leader of the opposition.    Updated at 5.19am BST    5.07am   Question time begins  Both of the opposition\u2019s questions have been on \u2026 Kristy McBain and her shares: It\u2019s the same questions and the same answers. McBain:  I refer to my previous answer and \u2026 yesterday and the day before. As soon as I became aware \u2026 I took steps to transfer those shares. At no point was that a conflict of interest. At no point have I presided over anything that required further displacements than I have already made. Now that the shares are close, I can consider the matter closed and so does the prime minister.    Updated at 5.13am BST    5.01am    New Labor senator points to first 100 days in government Fatima Payman, who delivered her first speech in the senate last night, is asked how Labor can convince people they were right to vote for them, on the ABC:  We have proven, in the last 100 days, we have taken action. We\u2019re actually doing something about the issues that have been - you know, accruing over the last decade. It\u2019s not something that is going to be fixed overnight. And I think Australians are sensible enough to know that it isn\u2019t - there isn\u2019t any quick fixes. We need a government that has the transparency and integrity to have the open communication and say: \u201cThis is what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re going to make responsible decisions on behalf of the Australian people.\u201d     Updated at 5.07am BST    4.51am    Ramos-Horta on Australia offering to help fund elections:  Well, many countries have done that to support local institutions. We in the past, we got a lot of support from the UN and of course the UN money comes from where? Comes from Australia, the US, that goes to the UNDP, the UN electoral experts, to set up the system. The voter registration, all of that. If it\u2019s Australia supporting the Solomon Islands or Papua New Guinea, yeah, that\u2019s very legitimate. And I would welcome Australia, even though we\u2019re a bit more financially secure, I would ask Australia to buy us some more modern technology for our election in Timor-Leste. Nothing wrong with it.   Updated at 4.56am BST    4.47am    Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta on Indo-Pacific geopolitics There were a few more topics covered off in that national press club address, including the responsibility of neighbours in the Pacific. The question was on Solomon Islands, but Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta spoke more widely:  Timor-Leste is absolutely very sensitive strategic location. We are 30 minutes, 45 minute jet fighter flight from Darwin. Next door is Indonesia. Not too far away is Singapore. Any leader that is serious about being a leader, you have to be sensitive to your neighbours. Don\u2019t bring in extra territorial, regional interests, powers, that might not be welcomed by our neighbours. I give you one example: In 2006 we have a security crisis in Timor-Leste. I was the foreign minister at the time. We collectively decided to invite Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Malaysia to deploy peace enforcers to Timor-Leste. Before the UN resolution. I called president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia to explain to him the situation in Timor-Leste, that we need to invite foreign forces to come to Timor-Leste. I inform him in advance. He appreciated and he even called the Malaysia to say go ahead, help the Timorese. So \u2026 we would never do anything, any rational Timorese leader would never do anything without taking into consideration the sensitivities of your neighbours. So, that would be my message to my brothers and sisters in Pacific islands.   Updated at 4.51am BST    4.41am   Peter Dutton 'claims Voice could 'usurp elders' and veto 'mining agreements'  Peter Dutton accused the government of asking Australians to sign up to an Indigenous Voice to parliament \u201csight unseen\u201d. He said:  We have no idea what it means for the mining sector. We don\u2019t know whether a voice that doesn\u2019t represent the elders that you negotiate with or that your agreement is with in a particular location, now, they might be usurped and [the voice will] exercise a veto, right? That would damage your employees, that would damage your business.\u201d  Dutton said the Liberals are in favour of reconciliation and \u201csensible reforms\u201d and would \u201cstand shoulder to shoulder with the government to do that\u201d. But he said corporate Australia felt pressure to \u201csign up to please others\u201d, which he described as a \u201cdisease\u201d.   Updated at 4.49am BST    4.38am    Peter Dutton told the Minerals Council that Australia needs a \u201cfrank debate\u201d about nuclear energy. Dutton said:  The imperative on all of us to create affordable and reliable and where possible emissions reduced energy necessitates that we at least have a conversation about nuclear. How that technology can play into the energy mix in the future? I think especially since Australia is home to one third of the world\u2019s deposits of uranium. We have a wonderful opportunity to add value to that resource.\u201d Dutton noted that in the last parliament Liberal Ted O\u2019Brien had written a report in favour of nuclear energy, and that was one of the reasons he was appointed to the shadow energy portfolio.  The Liberals have announced a review of their climate policies and nuclear, but Dutton already weighs in heavily in favour of nuclear. He noted:  Bob Hawke was strongly in favour of nuclear energy and couldn\u2019t get it through the left of his party. John Howard to this day is very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as an option \u2026 that crazy right-winger in Canada, Justin Trudeau, is embracing small modular reactors \u2026 If you don\u2019t like coal and you don\u2019t like gas, unless you believe clean hydrogen is about to be a reality, then what else firms up renewables? And I don\u2019t know the answer to that question beyond nuclear.\u201d  Dutton then flirted with full Bradfield-scheme areas by suggesting nuclear could \u201cpower up irrigation\u201d  Updated at 4.44am BST    4.32am   National Covid summary: 62 deaths reported  Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 62 deaths from Covid-19: ACT  Deaths: 0 Cases: 138 In hospital: 89 (with 1 person in ICU)  NSW  Deaths: 21 Cases: 3,666 In hospital: 1,581 (with 37 people in ICU)  Northern Territory  Deaths: 0 Cases: 87 In hospital: 15 (with no people in ICU)  Queensland  Deaths: 24  Cases: 1,776 In hospital: 240 (with 8 people in ICU)  South Australia  Deaths: 4 Cases: 646 In hospital: 90 (with 8 people in ICU)  Tasmania  Deaths: 0 Cases: 166 In hospital: 24 (with 1 people in ICU)  Victoria  Deaths: 11 Cases: 2,237 In hospital: 222 (with 18 people in ICU)  Western Australia  Deaths: 2 Cases: 1,335 In hospital: 199 (with 7 people in ICU)      4.30am    At the press club, Jose Ramos-Horta was asked to reflect on the actions of China in the region. Timor-Leste\u2019s president said he did not believe China would invade anyone, though he said it would need to be careful in its handling of the issues around Taiwan and South China Sea. He said China would have watched the situation in Ukraine closely and the consequences for Russia.  To feed itself, it depends on the stability in the seas, freedom of navigation. It depends on the stability in the world. China, with thousands of years of wisdom and observing what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, probably would weigh on the Chinese to continue the policies of the past of prudence in dealing with international differences with their differences. That\u2019s how I... I don\u2019t think that China intends to invade anyone. And in fact, you know, in fairness to them, God, they hardly ever invaded anyone. It was every European country that invaded them. You know, the British twice. Two wars. And the French and everybody them.  He also renewed his calls for Woodside and the Australian government to help it ensure the pipeline from the lucrative Greater Sunrise gas fields in the Timor Sea goes to his nation, rather than Darwin, as is currently proposed. He suggested investment from Indonesia could help this take place. The Greater Sunrise fields - worth an estimated $50bn - are critical to the nation\u2019s future.  I\u2019m confident the development of Greater Sunrise will happen. The pipeline will come to Timor-Leste. With Timor-Leste\u2019s own investment, which will be small, anyway, but even with Indonesian partners, and there are - Indonesia today is the fourth fastest growing economy, fourth best performing economy in the world, despite a global recession and all of that. And president Widodo and everyone else in Indonesia are very determined to incrementally increase the economic partnership with Timor-Leste. That can include the development of Greater Sunrise together with a body in the same area. So, I\u2019m confident this will happen.   Updated at 4.35am BST    4.29am    Ramos-Horta continues:  But as I said, Timor-Leste, we are even more peaceful than the Gulf countries. You know, whether you\u2019re talking about Qatar or Saudi Arabia or the Emirates. Who thought years ago that out of the Yemen conflict, missiles would be fired into Saudi oilfields, as it happened a year or so ago. Who would have thought that the Emirates would go into war in Yemen in response and the rebels in Yemen fire a missile into Abu Dhabi? And who thought that it would be possible that some of the Gulf corporation council members would impose sanctions on Qatar? So Timor-Leste, we are totally innocent. We have a great relationship with everybody. With Australia, with Indonesia, countries in region, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, North Korea! Oh, sorry! I meant to say, north-east Asia. I\u2019m actually blacklisted in North Korea! So zero sovereign risk. And you know, we are not Venezuela with nationalised companies and whatever. We don\u2019t have ... We haven\u2019t done in 20 years nothing. And we are so inefficient that we probably wouldn\u2019t know how to nationalise a company. So no need to fear.   Updated at 4.33am BST    4.28am    Ramos-Horta quizzed on Woodside What would he like the Australian government to do about Woodside? (Who wants to develop the Greater Sunrise gas field) Ramos-Horta:  I understand that an oil company like Woodside or any company or any other major business in democracies know pressure. They do what they think is the best economic financial interest. I understand that completely. And I don\u2019t think that it would be proper for me to subject putting pressure on Woodside. But, I suspect that if Woodside ... I suspect that Woodside would prefer to lose at least 30% of other revenues, let\u2019s say, if it were to go to Timor-Leste to get $50bn in revenues for its shareholders over the lifetime. If it goes to Darwin, it would probably generate only $30bn. It still would prefer to go to Darwin, because it is home. You know, so that\u2019s how Woodside would react. Partly, I think, maybe uncertainty. You know, so-called sovereign risk, etc. Totally understandable.  continued in the next post\u2026  Updated at 4.31am BST    4.23am   'Please don't lecture me'  Asked about how the Greater Sunrise gas project can be defended given the effects of the climate crisis on the Pacific, the Timor-Leste president says:  Greater Sunrise is gas, so cleaner energy. But non-renewable. But at the same time, I have to be very frank - the Americans, the US, the Europeans, and, of course, then Japan and, of course, China, and India. But first the Europeans, you were the ones who polluted the whole world with coal, with oil and everything that you can imagine. And we, unfortunately, discover oil and gas only now. And the Europeans are lecturing us - we have to move to fossil fuel. Away from fossil fuel. I have no authority to make any proposal, but I can make one of the top of my head. The Europeans, Australia, the US, give us $100bn and will give up on the Greater Sunrise development. As simple as that. Because the revenues from Greater Sun radical At Greater Sunrise is estimated at about $50bn. Plus, if you develop it, to generate, at least an additional $50bn or more. So give us $100bn and forget about the dispute of the pipeline, and we don\u2019t develop Greater Sunrise. Other than that, please don\u2019t lecture me!    Updated at 4.37am BST    4.20am    The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, is speaking at the Minerals Council about Australia\u2019s economic and emissions reduction trajectory. On today\u2019s growth figures, Dutton said there was \u201cquiet and cautious optimism\u201d about the state of the economy, but warned we are \u201cnot out of the woods\u201d, citing \u201csupply chain disruptions, inflation, interest rates, insurance premiums, and the rising cost of living and operating a business\u201d. Dutton noted that demand for critical minerals is \u201csoaring\u201d because of their role in renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles. He said:   EVs take six times the amount of minerals than a petrol car ... The inconvenient truth for activists is that decarbonisation will require more mining. I take some delight knowing it must keep them up at night.\u201d  Dutton said the Liberals \u201cdon\u2019t support locking in\u201d the 43% emissions reduction target because \u201csome nations will not honour their targets, including some competitor nations\u201d. The target \u201cwill put us in an inflexible position\u201d and make it \u201charder if not impossible\u201d for EFIC, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and CSIRO to support resource projects. Dutton labelled the safeguard mechanism - which the Coalition legislated under PM Tony Abbott and environment minister Greg Hunt - as a \u201cbattering ram\u201d and a \u201ctax by stealth\u201d. He said that infrastructure projects, mining and construction \u201cwill increasingly become prey to green activism and warfare\u201d. He cited 2,000 climate court cases around the world \u201cmany related to national targets\u201d which he said \u201cceded control to climate advocates\u201d.     4.18am    Dr Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta takes question on China Here is part of his answer:  China has an unfortunate geography, unlike the US, where to the north you have Canada, to the south Mexico, to the east and west the vast oceans unimpeded. And China has too many neighbours. Too many choke points. And to feed itself, it depends on the stability in the seas, freedom of navigation. It depends on the stability in the world. And China, with thousands of years of wisdom and observing what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, probably would weigh on the Chinese to continue the policies of the past of prudence in dealing with international differences with their differences. That\u2019s how I ... I don\u2019t think that China intends to invade anyone. And in fact, you know, in fairness to them, God, they hardly ever invaded anyone. It was every European country that invaded them. You know, the British twice. Two wars. And the French and everybody then. Even ... Well, the Portuguese didn\u2019t invade them. The Portuguese helped them actually. The Portuguese helped the Chinese fighting the pirates, hence the South China Sea. And in recognition, the Portuguese gave them Macau. It was a gift from China in recognition for Portuguese support with the China fighting of pirates in the South China Sea.    Updated at 4.23am BST    4.11am    Jim Chalmers shoots down questions about stage-three tax cuts Back to treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 press conference: he shot down questions about whether he personally believed the stage-three tax cuts should go ahead. Those tax cuts, due to commence in 2024, are geared massively toward high-income earners and have been criticised for making Australia\u2019s tax system far less progressive. Chalmers was asked about the economic benefit of the tax cuts by the Greens in question time yesterday, and he did not exactly mount a stirring defence \u2013 leading to further questions over whether the changes may be amended before they come in. But at his press conference today, when asked by Guardian Australia if he personally wanted to see them go ahead, he gave no nod either way.  I\u2019ve made it really clear that our position on the stage three tax cuts hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he said.  However, he didn\u2019t rule out looking at the tax cuts when they came closer. When pressed over whether he actually believed in them, Chalmers went back to his standard lines that the government had more \u201cnear-term priorities\u201d on cost of living relief, childcare and cheaper medicines.  When you consider that those tax cuts don\u2019t come in for a couple of years, the right and responsible thing is to focus on some of the issues that I\u2019ve talked about today, like labour shortages, skills shortages, cost of living, getting wages moving again,\u201d he said.    Updated at 4.14am BST    4.07am    Lower house debates Labor\u2019s aged care promises The government\u2019s election commitments on aged care (including the mandated 24/7 nurses on duty in facilities) are being debated in the lower house now. The government has the numbers to pass the bill but the Coalition opposition is concerned that it \u201clacks any detail\u201d about exemptions that will be available to homes that can\u2019t find enough nurses to fulfil that requirement, with shadow health minister Anne Ruston raising worries that the mandate may see some centres close. The opposition is moving amendments asking the government to more explicitly lay out the exemptions in the legislation, detail which is currently not in the bill. Deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley moved amendments noting that 86% of providers that don\u2019t have 24/7 nurses now are small providers and 53% in regional and remote areas. Ruston told Guardian Australia that she feared homes in rural, regional and remote areas may be affected by the new mandate, and wanted to see more info on the exemptions available:  The opposition is seriously concerned that this bill is little more than a legislative framework that lacks any detail about how the provisions of the legislation will impact on the aged care sector and older Australians.It is concerning that the government has not been transparent on any of the details of their proposed exemption clause for their requirement for 24/7 registered nurses, which will be contained in unsighted delegated legislation.We are urging the government to outline the scope of the exemption clause to the 24/7 registered nurses requirement and the eligibility criteria for that exemption before a vote is sought on this legislation.

Experts say the agreement is significant and will substantially upgrade the bilateral defence relationship between the two countries. Swinburne University of Technology professor Michael Leach, an expert on Timor-Leste, said:   This agreement represents a significant upgrade in the bilateral defence relationship. In the context of recent tensions in the region, it\u2019s an affirmation of close security cooperation, including around the shared maritime boundary This agreement will be celebrated in Canberra, and observers will be watching to see if other announcements follow in relation to downstream oil and gas processing in the Greater Sunrise field, which is a central preoccupation of the Timorese government.  The agreement will allow greater military cooperation, including maritime patrols in the Timor Sea, by clarifying the protections that both militaries will be afforded while in each other\u2019s territory.  Updated at 4.08am BST    4.05am    ACTU react after workers\u2019 share of GDP shrinks to record low Remember that sense of calm over Parliament House last week during the Jobs and Skills Summit? Well, there\u2019s been some interference in the harmony vibe. Well, the ACTU has noted that workers\u2019 share of GDP has sunk to a record low 44.1% while profits have kept rising. Labour productivity growth, meanwhile, quickened to 2.1%, or the fastest in a decade.  Workers have the lowest share of GDP on record because productivity growth continues to outpace workers\u2019 wages while businesses are raking in billion-dollar profits,\u201d said Sally McManus, ACTU\u2019s Secretary. If we want to stop living standards going backwards in this country, then we need to give power back to workers and reform the bargaining system.  Women continue to be paid substantially less than men and industries dominated by women remain undervalued and underpaid,\u201d McManus said. \u201cTo get gender equity, women need the power to bargain, and multi-employer bargaining is how it\u2019s done.\u201d  That\u2019s a bit of warning... Economists, though, also pointed out that business activity \u2013 outside of mining \u2013 was among the disappointing elements in the GDP data dump. Building construction, for instance, fell 5%. \u201cThe latest capital expenditure survey suggests spending will lift in the current financial year and the continuation of the Instant Asset Tax Write-off will help drive this,\u201d Sarah Hunter, a KPMG senior economist, said. \u201c[B]ut the turn in the economic cycle coupled with the challenges in the building sector will become increasing drags over time. \u201cOverall, momentum is set to ease from now on, as the headwinds that have built up over the last six months flow into actual spending,\u201d Hunter said. Where will the tailwinds come from if governments are forced to curb spending (or spend more on debt repayments) and consumers slow their consumption of their own savings \u2013 and those RBA rate rises start to bite?  Updated at 4.10am BST    4.02am    Dr Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta says:  I ask the Australian leaders \u2013 when you look at Timor-Leste, and open the map of the area, put on a big table \u2013 don\u2019t forget about the median line. It is there. Australia accepted a permanent maritime boundary between us and Australia based on the median line, as against past positions where Australia claimed that the maritime boundary extended beyond the median line all the way to almost the shores of Timor-Leste based on the ancient law of the sea that accepted the continental shelf. I remember a few years ago, I think Prime Minister Albanese was there when I spoke in Balmain. And I said, based on Australia\u2019s claim of shelf, I would say the following: A) there are no two continental shelfs between Timor-Leste and Australia. There\u2019s only one continental shelf. And based on that, Timor-Leste could claim also the whole of Australia! The only country I wouldn\u2019t claim would be Tasmania! Because they are such nice people. I would leave them alone! And since then, Australia slept in fear and agreed to the middle line maritime boundary, thanks to Xanana Gusm\u0101o\u2019s brilliance and audacity. And the sense of, I call it, a sense of state on the part of Australia, particularly Julie Bishop who, together with Xanana, negotiated or agreed the median line, elevating Australian stand in the world.   Updated at 4.04am BST    3.51am   Timor-Leste to join Asean  Dr Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta says Timor-Leste is doing well and is \u201can oasis of tranquility\u201d. But he says there world isn\u2019t in the same place:  We are doing pretty well. But the challenge of next five to 10 years is enormous. Who would have thought or think that after Bosnia, after World War II, after the Balkans, the genocide in Bosnia and that Europe would confront with one of the most dangerous times with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. With no end in sight. And who knows what\u2019s going to happen in Ukraine. And who would have thought that the regime in Myanmar would launch a coup following the landslide election by Aung San Suu Kyi. Being a member of Asean in the heart of Asia. So, nothing can be discarded as risks and dangers. South China Sea, Taiwan, all of this as we see the militarisation of the South China Sea. We see incredible tensions over Taiwan. And, of course, not to discard North Korea. But, Timor-Leste remains an oasis of tranquillity. And then he says:   And the good news \u2013 after more than 10 years of effort on our part, on the part of our government, starting with the first government led by Mr Xanana Gusm\u0101o in 2007. In 2011, we applied to join Asean. Well, news that we probably will be joining next year in 2023... Completing the south-east Asian family of nations.    Updated at 3.56am BST    3.44am    First Peoples\u2019 Assembly of Victoria backs Melbourne City Council move to advocate to change the date of Australia Day The co-chair of the First Peoples\u2019 Assembly of Victoria, Marcus Stewart, has backed Melbourne City Council\u2019s decision to advocate for the Albanese government to change the date of Australia Day from 26 January. At a council meeting on Tuesday, councillors voted to campaign for the Albanese government to change the date \u2013 a decision that can only be made at a federal level. The lord mayor of Melbourne, Sally Capp, said the decision was about advancing reconciliation and unity with First Nations Victorians, and described it as \u201clocal government leadership\u201d. But the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said there are no plans to shift the national celebration.  Stewart on Wednesday said the council had made a decision to stand \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with First Nations people to reconsider a date that could bring all Australians together to celebrate.  This is not a new ask. Our communities have been protesting since 1938 so that\u2019s 84 years ... It\u2019s an important step forward and it\u2019s an important contribution to a broader dialogue. Dialogue is critical in circumstances such as this and I think what we need is to have a mature conversation with everyone.  The council decision makes clear it will continue to host citizenship ceremonies on 26 January \u2013 as well as issue permits for the Victorian government\u2019s parade on that day \u2013 if the commonwealth does not change the date.  Updated at 3.50am BST    3.35am   Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta addresses National Press Club  Dr Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta is at the press club. National Press Club president Laura Tingle introduces him, and tells this story:  A few years ago, a bureaucrat from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet rang me asking for contact details for my dad, John, who for many years was a journalist and broadcaster. The guy from PM and C said Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta was visiting Australia and had particularly asked if they could arrange a meeting with Mr Tingle who he remembered fondly from dealings in the past when dad was good to him. Let\u2019s be honest \u2013 I thought it was a crank call. I rang Dad and he said, \u201cOh, yes, I interviewed him. He\u2019s got into a bit of a tight spot and I smuggled him out of a building in the boot of my car!\u201d I mentioned the story because, well, it\u2019s a good story. And I am just a little bit impressed with what you learn about your parents getting up to when you\u2019re not looking! Go dad! But also because it goes to an underlying theme of Australia\u2019s relationships with Timor-Leste. That is, unfortunately, about skulduggery, quite often. People sometimes doing the right thing by a near neighbour, but unfortunately, too often in Australia\u2019s case, of not doing the right thing. I acknowledge and welcome Bernard Collaery, who is in the room today.    Updated at 3.40am BST    3.32am    Some analysis of GDP data  Economists combing through the fine hairs of the GDP data rug are finding a few snags but also the silky bits.Westpac had been among the more bullish, predicting last week that June quarter GDP would be a big 4.5% higher than a year ago. Then they saw more figures earlier this week that brought their prediction close to the 3.6% pace that the ABS reported today. The bank\u2019s Andrew Hanlan, an economist, singled out consumer spending and exports as the bright spots, as we did in this running wrap:  Consumer spending rose 2.2% for the quarter (although Westpac had tipped 2.8%) but was still a \u201ckey upside surprise\u201d. Hanlan noted that 2.2% gain matches that the March quarter, which had been revised higher from a 1.5% growth pace reported by the ABS previously. That period \u2013 though it seems an age ago now \u2013 had been disrupted by big floods in parts of eastern Australia and the Omicron Covid wave. Elsewhere, though, \u201cconditions were mixed \u2013 construction work was down, public demand was flat (representing a consolidation) and inventories were a sizeable drag\u201d, he said. That governments might have started to tighten their belts might not be a bad thing given the yawning deficits facing most state and federal governments. Among the states, NSW led the way with final demand growing 1.9%, with Victoria and Queensland expanding 1%. Resource rich WA managed only 0.1% growth \u2013 perhaps reflecting the drop in iron ore prices in that state.  Updated at 3.37am BST    3.31am    Cost of childcare, Tafe and medicines key to easing cost-of-living pressures, treasurer says So what about household spending? Is Jim Chalmers worried about the money going into the economy? Chalmers:  When it comes to the behaviour of households, you know, it\u2019s not for me to tell people how to manage their own household budgets. The independent Reserve Bank has made it clear that they see a role for themselves in managing that demand in the economy, and our job is not to second-guess that and nor is it to make the job of the independent Reserve Bank harder. And so what we are trying to do is provide cost-of-living relief in the most responsible way that we can, and in a way that delivers another economic dividend, making childcare cheaper delivers a massive economic dividend and making medicines cheaper delivers a massive dividend when it comes to health cost. Easing the cost of Tafe in some areas is obviously a cost-of-living measure. Making electric vehicles cheaper with the tax cut that we hope to pass through the parliament. Getting wages moving again. These are the things we can responsibly do to help Australians through a very tough period without interfering with the work that the Reserve Bank does independently.   Updated at 3.40am BST    3.28am    These figures are for the June quarter, so don\u2019t take into account all the interest rate rises since May \u2013 so you can guarantee those household savings are even lower now     3.27am    Chalmers says government has to \u2018deal with the legacy of rorts and waste\u2019 to balance budget So savings are depleting, the bumps in commodity prices are temporary and won\u2019t last, and cost-of-living pressures are biting. What else? Jim Chalmers:  These numbers today are new numbers but they\u2019re telling a story which is now pretty familiar to us \u2013 a growing economy, but we want to see more Australians benefit from that growth. Different pressures are hitting the economy, but our future is still packed with potential. We\u2019ve got an economy which has been made vulnerable by a wasted decade and the task of the budget, the task of the government is to make our economy and our budget more resilient into the future as well. ... We are obviously meeting the expenditure review committee for some hours, including late into last night, and that\u2019s important because budgets at their core are about weighing up competing priorities. The prime minister has been upfront with people about the challenges we face in the budget. We will do the right and responsible thing and that means doing what we can to responsibly ease people\u2019s cost-of-living pressures. It means dealing with the issues in supply chains, which are holding our economy back, and it means beginning to deal with the legacy of rorts and waste which has been a feature of our budgets for too long.    Updated at 3.52am BST    3.22am    Australia\u2019s economy \u2018being held back by capacity constraints\u2019, treasurer says Jim Chalmers is not celebrating the national accounts figures. He says it\u2019s good, but there is a story behind it:  Today\u2019s national accounts reflect an economy which is rebounding from the disruptions of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still being held back by capacity constraints, skills short ages and declining real wages. This is an economy which is growing, but the challenges are growing as well. It\u2019s a solid outcome, but it doesn\u2019t tell the full story about our economy.  So what exactly? Chalmers:  The headline figures in today\u2019s national accounts are encouraging, but the details do confirm the pressures that are being felt by Australians and in our supply chains in particular. Real GDP increased by 0.9% for the June quarter and was 3.6% higher over the year to June. This solid growth is welcome and it\u2019s broadly in line with our expectations but the drivers of this growth were still narrow little based. It was supported by some temporary factors and a lot has happened since the end of June. The big contributors to growth were household spending and exports. Consumption increased by 2.2%, contributing 1.1 percentage points to real GDP growth and a big part of this story is the fact that people felt increasingly willing to spend on discretionary services in particular as we came out of that phase of the pandemic. At the same time, as we\u2019ve seen that growth in consumption, we\u2019ve seen a pretty sharp decline in the household savings ratio, which fell from just over 11% in March to 8.7% in the June quarter. What this shows is that while households on average are still saving, they\u2019re saving less and we also know that they\u2019re impacted by the rising cost of living and the fact that their real wages are falling as a consequence of that.

Updated at 3.15am BST    3.05am   Defence agreement signed with Timor-Leste  A new defence cooperation agreement has been signed between Australia and Timor-Leste. The government statement describes it as:  The DCA is a status of forces agreement that sets out the reciprocal protections, responsibilities and privileges each country will grant the military personnel of the other in its territory. \u2026 The DCA will allow Australia and Timor-Leste to increase defence and security cooperation, especially in the maritime domain, given our shared border and adjacent maritime zones. It will enhance our ability to operate together as required, conduct exercises and training, and cooperate on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The agreement means Timorese military members operating, exercising or training in Australia will receive the same protections, responsibilities and privileges as Australian personnel will receive in Timor-Leste.    Also discussed were common security, economic cooperation, labour mobility and skills, the green economy and Australia\u2019s support for Timor-Leste\u2019s Asean membership bid.   Updated at 3.13am BST    2.57am    Rundown of GDP figures  GDP figures out today from the ABS showed the economy had decent momentum in the June quarter \u2013 much to the chagrin, perhaps, of the Morrison government that was bundled out by voters before the quarter ended. The overall numbers were much in line with forecasts \u2013 somewhere just below 1% for the quarter and around 3.5% had been the expectation. We knew exports would provide ballast for the economy, since many commodities remain at elevated levels (and compared with import prices have never been this high). That\u2019s a fat 1 percentage point of the quarter\u2019s growth just there. We also knew that inventories \u2013 all those things businesses hold in store for shoppers \u2013 had dropped too. That lopped 1.2 percentage points from growth and presumably will bounce back in coming quarters, serving to boost GDP figures when they do. What looks a standout, though, was domestic demand, particularly households. The latter lifted spending by a solid 2.2%, adding 1.1 percentage points to growth (even as shrinking government outlays trimmed 0.2 percentage points). That spending as we know wasn\u2019t backed by big wage increases (they rose just 2.6% from a year early) so it was households dipping into their savings that paid for it. Spending on transport services (up 37.3%) and hotels, cafes and restaurants (up 8.8%), while spending on food fell 1.2%, the ABS said. The household saving to income ratio fell for the third consecutive quarter, from 11.1% to 8.7%, but remains above pre-Covid levels \u2013 for now at least.  Updated at 3.02am BST    2.56am    \u2018Better times lie ahead,\u2019 treasurer says So what is the main takeaway from the national accounts latest? Jim Chalmers says:  While there are signs that wages are starting to pick up, the national accounts measure of average earnings increased by less than the consumer price index over the year to June, indicating falling real wages. Real household disposable income fell for the third consecutive quarter, by 0.5% in the June quarter. While our economy is being buffeted by global pressures and domestic constraints right now, Australians can be confident that better times lie ahead. Our economic plan is focused on steering the economy through these difficult economic circumstances, by delivering responsible cost of living relief and building a stronger, more resilient economy. We are working hard to deliver on our commitments to boost the capacity of our economy through more investments in skills and education, cleaner and cheaper energy, and advanced manufacturing and to ease cost-of-living pressures through cheaper childcare and medicines. Ten years of wasted opportunities have made our economy more vulnerable to global and domestic shocks and the task of the budget is to start making our economy more resilient.    Updated at 3.08am BST    2.43am    We \u2018desperately\u2019 need a living wage, says early childcare education director Laura, an early childcare education director based in Canberra and United Workers Union member is at a press conference on the national day of action with her young daughter. Laura says:  We are a struggling workforce that has supported frontline and essential workers for the last 2.5 years through a pandemic and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired. We are overworked, undervalued and incredibly underpaid. We know that the workforce needs fixing, we know that there is an entire workforce out there that\u2019s walked away from the sector because we don\u2019t have a living wage. That\u2019s one of the things we desperately need is a wage that we can survive on, a wage that we \u2013 that will help us with the rising cost of living and that\u2019s one of the biggest things our teachers need.  Her daughter agrees.  Updated at 2.49am BST    2.39am    Jim Chalmers will hold a press conference on the national accounts very soon, but here is the first quick take from his office:  In the two months since the end of the June quarter, we\u2019ve seen a deteriorating global growth outlook, continuing labour shortages, and rising interest rates which are straining businesses and households and creating headwinds for our economy over the year ahead. Real GDP increased by 0.9 per cent for the June quarter and was 3.6 per cent higher over the year to June. This result is due to solid growth in household spending and exports. Consumption increased by 2.2 per cent contributing 1.1 percentage points to real GDP growth, as spending on services continued to rebound following the disruption of the pandemic. Exports recovered and imports slowed, resulting in a solid contribution of 1.0 percentage point to real GDP growth from net exports. Mining and agriculture picked up as severe weather conditions passed, and energy exporters responded to the strong global demand for energy in the wake of disruptions to Russian gas supplies to Europe. Services exports also grew on the back of more tourists and students arriving back in Australia, but tourism and in-person education exports remain low, at around one quarter and one-half their pre-pandemic levels. While commodity prices strengthened in response to strong global demand for energy and pushed our terms of trade to a record high, we don\u2019t expect this strength to continue. This temporary boost saw nominal GDP increase by 4.3 per cent over the quarter to be 12.1 per cent higher over the year.    Updated at 2.42am BST    2.32am   GDP up 3.6% on last year  Australia\u2019s economy growth in the second quarter has just come in, via the ABS.

It\u2019s not just Year 9 and Year 11 where these deceased young people were in these year groups. The playground, recess, lunch, siblings, peers, interactions outside of school impact on all of our students. It\u2019s deeply distressing news. I can\u2019t imagine what that or those five families are going through today but I know as a school community having spoken to our principal just a short time ago in Warren Parkes, the entire school community is feeling it. The entire staff body, the entire student body are deeply impacted by this tragic news and the department will put all of its endeavour by way of expert support into our Picton high school community for as long as it\u2019s needed.   Updated at 2.25am BST    2.11am    Students and staff at Picton high school receiving counselling after Buxton crash Staff and students at Picton high school are being offered counselling and support. Murat Dizdar from the NSW Department of Education says the entire school community is in shock:  As the community in New South Wales would appreciate, it\u2019s a deeply distressing phone call to get from New South Wales police, where we find out overnight that we\u2019ve lost five young learners \u2026 we have two separate counselling teams that are onsite at the school as we speak. One of those teams is a dedicated expert unit to support staff that are impacted and feeling the stress of this news \u2026 We have a separate team of counselling experts at the school to support a student body of close to 1,100 students. We have offered our principal and staff at the school as well as Year 9 and Year 11 and each of the year groups at the school separately to talk to them about what we\u2019ve been informed from New South Wales police and the supports that are available to them.   Updated at 2.31am BST    2.09am    NSW police\u2019s Jason Hogan said all drivers should confront the crash footage:  Not just young drivers but all drivers should have a look at the footage, have a look at what investigations have happened, have a look at court outcomes and really take stock of their driving to get home safely, to reach their destinations, look after themselves, their passengers and other road users.   Updated at 2.11am BST    2.05am    On the scene emergency responders faced, Jason Hogan said:  It would have been extremely confronting. They would have had a little bit of warning in relation to the police radio messages but upon arriving at the scene, it\u2019s not something that anyone wants to do but you slip into your police mode and carry the business out that needs to be done to ensure that if we can save lives, that that is undertaken first and then, unfortunately, we slip into investigation mode, as we did in these circumstances.      2.04am   NSW police reveal details of horror crash that killed five teenagers  We are just jumping out of politics for a moment to bring you an update from NSW police on the horror car crash. Five teenagers were killed in a single-vehicle road crash near Buxton, about 100km south-west of Sydney. Only the driver survived. Acting inspector Jason Hogan says investigations are ongoing:  The driver was subjected to a breath test at the scene, which was negative, and he was arrested and taken to hospital for mandatory blood and alcohol testing, and we will be awaiting the test results for that test.  All were students or ex-students Picton high school. There were six people in the four-seater car.   Updated at 2.26am BST    1.58am    Here is Penny Wong meeting with Dr Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta.

Updated at 2.02am BST    1.49am    Birmingham questions how Solomon Islands offer was made public Now, the Solomon Islands opposition though, believe that the government is attempting to delay the election to stay in power.  So, is it possible the Solomon Islands government response to the Australian offer being made public is about something else? Simon Birmingham is not giving any leeway (and neither would have Labor if it was in opposition).  This is quite an extraordinary statement and the accusations made in the statement in relation to the way in which this issue has been handled do point to issues on the side of the Albanese government. The Solomon Islands are clearly aggrieved at the fact that this was made public; in the way it was made public; when it was made public. And that\u2019s why there are answers to be had from the Albanese government about whether they informed the Solomon Islands in advance that they would be making the offer public in this way and, if not, why not?   Updated at 1.53am BST    1.45am   Government \u2018mishandled\u2019 funding offer to Solomon Islands, Birmingham says  Simon Birmingham swung by doors this morning to make a statement:  Late yesterday, we saw a most extraordinary statement issued by the government of the Solomon Islands that accuses the Albanese government and foreign minister Penny Wong of engaging in ways that interfere in the domestic affairs of the Solomon Islands and interfere in relation to their national interests and democracy. Now, the Albanese government was entirely right to offer to provide assistance for the conduct of Solomon Islands elections. However, the execution of that offer appears to have been woefully undertaken, given the response it has elicited from the Solomon Islands government. There are many questions that the Albanese government is going to have to answer in relation to this offer; around when it was made; what discussions occurred prior to the making of this offer; whether the Solomon Islands government was aware the offer was going to be made public; if they weren\u2019t then why the government chose to make it public, when they made it public? This is a very significant statement issued by the Solomon Islands and clearly the Albanese government has mishandled this very sensitive matter and needs to provide answers and explanations in relation to it.   Updated at 1.51am BST    1.37am    The president of Timor-Leste, Dr Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, is visiting Australia today and will meet with Anthony Albanese.

Here is the shadow early childhood education minister, Angie Bell:  Today is early childhood educators day, and as educators gather around the country to call for better pay and conditions, the Albanese government remains quiet on their promises for the sector. Labor have been in government for more than 100 days but have provided no details on how they\u2019ll address current issues in the sector, including worker shortages and fee hikes. Their union talkfest has delivered nothing for the early childhood education sector \u2013 even though the minister previously claimed that it would. Labor have also failed to provide further details on the ACCC price mechanism and productivity commission review, which they promised would help alleviate pressures at the election.  I mean, the Coalition was in government for almost a decade and didn\u2019t manage to find solutions for some of these things they are demanding be fixed because it has been three and a bit months already, but I guess everything looks different in opposition.  Updated at 1.16am BST    12.59am    To be fair to Sussan Ley, Angus Taylor made a bigger mash of it, when he spent a few minutes telling Sky\u2019s Laura Jayes a few days ago that it was a travesty that veterans were excluded, only to be told veterans were included.  That was greeted with a beat of silence.     12.57am    Government will expedite legislation on pension changes, said Albanese yesterday For the record, this was what Anthony Albanese announced four days ago on the letting pensioners work more plan:  Age and veterans pensioners will be able to earn an additional $4,000 over this financial year without losing any of their pension due to the Albanese Labor government providing a one-off income credit designed to give older Australians the option to work and keep more of their money. Following the successful jobs and skills summit in Canberra, an immediate $4,000 income credit will be added to the income banks of age pensioners from December to be used this financial year. The temporary income bank top-up will increase the amount pensioners can earn from $7,800 to $11,800 this year, before their pension is reduced. The measure is designed to enable pensioners who want to work, to immediately boost the supply of labour to help meet shortages. Pensioners will be able to do so without losing their pension, either in short stints or over the course of a year. The $4,000 temporary credit will be available until June 30, 2023, subject to the passage of legislation. The government will also look to strengthen legislation to ensure pensioners who are working don\u2019t get unnecessarily kicked out of the social security system. The government will expedite legislation to ensure pensioners don\u2019t have to reapply for payments for up to two years if their employment income exceeds the income limit. Currently their connection to social security is cancelled after 12 weeks of exceeding the income limit.   Updated at 1.04am BST    12.57am    Ley says Albanese government should have acted on pensioner plan sooner So what is one thing that could be done, Sussan Ley? Ley:  Cost of living, cost of living, cost of living.  Peter Stefanovic, the host of the Sky show Ley was appearing on, tried asking again:  I mean, Chris Richardson on the program a short time ago as well he says that there\u2019s actually not that much that can be done in the short term. We\u2019ve got the tiger by the tail when it comes to inflation. So what\u2019s one thing the government could do right now?  Ley:  Well, they could implement our pensioner plan [interrupted].  Stefanovic: \u201cThey\u2019ve said they\u2019re doing that.\u201d Ley:  Well, they\u2019ve said they\u2019re doing it, but it hasn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s not there in people\u2019s workplaces now. So this is an indication of a government that talks the talk, but doesn\u2019t walk the walk. That pensioner plan could have had people working in businesses already, it could have taken the pressure off finding someone to actually keep your doors open. Of paying someone more than you know you can afford because you can\u2019t find the right person, of closing your doors. All of these things are pressures on inflation and pressures on the economy. That\u2019s one good idea that the government decided to not implement but wait for its jobs and skills union talk fest in order to sort of have a big reveal at the end of it about all these things that are happening. But just like the announcement that was made this morning, that are not happening now. I come back to my point, I\u2019m not in the cabinet. We\u2019re not the government, but that expenditure review committee should have proposals before it and it should be thinking about the here and now.   Updated at 1.02am BST    12.52am    Sussan Ley compares Anthony Albanese to Kermit the frog Sussan Ley really likes Kermit the Frog. This was the deputy Liberal leader\u2019s contribution to the debate yesterday:  And she has continued in that vein today. She told Sky News:  Everything that relates to cost of living should be a priority. Now as a cabinet, and of course, I\u2019m not in cabinet, I\u2019m not a member of the expenditure review committee, that committee would be receiving many proposals at this point in time, all directed, I hope to reducing the cost-of-living pressures similar to the one that we implemented almost immediately, about reducing the fuel excise halving it for six months. Where is the indication that this government is even considering measures that help with the cost of living now This is a government that likes to take credit for so many things, but it\u2019s just not taking action. This week we saw them taking credit for the fact that pension payments are going up. Well pension payments are linked to inflation. Inflation is at a 30-year high. The same increase to pensions would have happened if Kermit the Frog was prime minister.  And yet we see the government taking credit. What we need to see is a government that takes real action. Your previous government speaker was sitting there almost wringing his hands on your program talking about this \u2018bad situation\u2019. That\u2019s not giving Australians confidence that they need.   Updated at 12.57am BST    12.39am   Bill to incentivise pensioners to downsize introduced to parliament  The \u201clet us help you baby boomers sell your empty nest home\u201d legislation, also known as the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Incentivising Pensioners to Downsize) Bill 2022 has just been introduced to the parliament. What does it do? Here are the explanatory notes: This Bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans\u2019 Entitlements Act 1986 to better support pensioners (or other eligible income support recipients) during the sale and purchase of a new principal home, by:  Extending the existing assets test exemption for principal home sale proceeds which a person intends to use to buy a new principal home from 12 months to 24 months. Applying only the lower below threshold deeming rate to these asset test exempt principal home sale proceeds when calculating deemed income.  These changes reduce the impact of selling and buying a new principal home on an income support recipient\u2019s rate of payment.  Updated at 12.43am BST    12.32am   China must 'do better' on detained journalist Cheng Lei, Albanese says  The Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, spoke to ABC\u2019s 7.30 program last night and said he has been trying to get Australian journalist Cheng Lei access to her family. Here\u2019s some more on this from the prime minister\u2019s press conference. Anthony Albanese said:  Well, this is something that should happen. Cheng Lei should have access to her family. Australia continues to make representation and we have a very strong view about her treatment, and we\u2019ll continue to make representation. There\u2019s been no transparency in any of these processes at all. And the Chinese government needs to do better.  Q: \u201cPrime Minister, the ambassador has also flagged diplomatic research, he suggested that he\u2019s trying to create an atmosphere to allow a sideline discussion for you and the Chinese premier at the G20 in Indonesia, is that something you are open to?\u201d Albanese:  I\u2019m open to dialogue with anyone at any time, particularly with leaders of other nations. It\u2019s a good thing if there is dialogue, and certainly, if such a meeting took place I would welcome it as I welcome dialogue with leaders throughout the region and throughout the globe.  Q: \u201cDo you know of any approaches between his office and the foreign ministry or your office?\u201d Albanese:  No.   Updated at 1.15am BST    12.27am    Albanese says budget constraints mean \u2018we can\u2019t do everything\u2019 And on those \u2018difficult decisions\u2019 in the budget? Q: \u201cIs it cuts or is it the end of measures like the fuel excise pause or is it something else?\u201d Anthony Albanese:  Well, it is what it is, I was just being straight with the partyroom as I\u2019ve been straight with the people of Australia. We\u2019ve inherited a trillion dollars of Liberal party debt. When interest rate rises, so do the repayment costs of that Liberal party debt. What that means is that we can\u2019t do everything that we would like to do. We\u2019ve already foreshadowed as well, that will be going through line by line, looking for the waste which was there from the former government, looking for their largess and these funds that were established just for political purposes, not for the national interest. So we will be doing that. I look forward to Jim Chalmers delivering the budget next month.  Q: \u201cShould Australians be preparing for tough decisions to come up with difficult cuts like that?\u201d Albanese:  I\u2019ve answered the question.   Updated at 12.31am BST    12.23am    Anthony Albanese sells Canberra property At his press conference earlier, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, revealed he had recently sold his property in Canberra. A journalist asked: \u201cTwo questions. In relation, you\u2019ve got a policy out today that is in relation to encouraging Baby Boomers to move out and have a better system for their pension basically in relation to deeming rates. Now you own three properties yourself, nothing wrong with that, but they\u2019re listed as residential in Canberra, then you\u2019ve got investments in Sydney and the family home, given the debate about housing affordability, are any of those properties empty? Are they tenanted? Are you getting rental income for those properties?\u201d Albanese said:  I\u2019ve sold my Canberra property. I have a home in Sydney that I am in the process of moving things out of, I haven\u2019t made a decision about that yet, and I have a rental property in Sydney.  It was sold at auction a couple of weeks ago, he said. Given Canberra property prices are INSANE, chances are he received a good price too.  Updated at 12.29am BST    12.22am   Victoria records 11 Covid deaths  In Victoria, 11 more people have lost their lives to Covid, and 222 people are in hospital in the state being treated for the virus. There were 2,237 cases reported yesterday.   Updated at 12.26am BST    12.20am   NSW records 21 Covid deaths  New South Wales has reported 21 lives lost to Covid in the last day, and 1,581 people are in hospital being treated for the virus.   Updated at 12.25am BST    12.18am   Pharmacy Guild welcomes changes to PBS  The Pharmacy Guild of Australia is pretty happy with the government this morning. The government is increasing the subsidy for drugs, cutting the maximum PBS co-payment from $42.50 to $30 a prescription. From its statement: The national president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Prof Trent Twomey, said this was the single most significant change to the cost of and access to medicines since the PBS was introduced 75 years ago.  As primary healthcare workers, community pharmacists have increasingly been hearing patients say they simply cannot afford their medicines, often faced with deciding who in the family will go without in order to put food on the table or pay their bills. The guild and community pharmacies have advocated strongly on behalf of patients for a reduction of the cost of medicines and today we thank the federal government for taking action. The reduction in the co-payment is a 30% saving on the cost of each prescription. It means an individual will save $150 a year for one monthly script, or $300 to $450 a year for two to three scripts a month. This is an annual saving of almost $200m which will be put back into the pockets of Australians.   Updated at 12.25am BST    12.01am   'We want good relations with our Pacific neighbours', PM says  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has declined to engage with criticisms from Solomon Islands leader, Manasseh Sogavare, who accused Australia of \u201can assault on our parliamentary democracy\u201d in offering to help fund the nation\u2019s elections. Sogavare, who will visit Australia next month, has proposed to delay the election by several months. Australian foreign minister Penny Wong said yesterday the government had offered funding to subsidise the cost of an election. At a press conference this morning in Canberra, Albanese was asked about the comments from Australia\u2019s neighbour. He did not directly respond to the criticisms.  We want good relations with our Pacific neighbours and I\u2019m very much looking forward to hosting Prime Minister Sogavare, I\u2019ll be hosting him at the Lodge for dinner in just a few weeks time in October.   Responding to the Chinese ambassador\u2019s interview on the ABC last night, when Xiao Qian said he was seeking to allow detained Australian journalist Cheng Lei access to her family, Albanese was more forthcoming:  This is something that should happen, Cheng Lei should have access to her family. Australia continues to make representation and we have a very strong view about her treatment. There\u2019s been no transparency in any of these processes at all, the Chinese government needs to do better.  Albanese said he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, after the ambassador suggested there could be a long-awaited meeting between the leaders \u2013 potentially at an upcoming international summit.  I\u2019m open to dialogue with anyone at any time, particularly with leaders of other nations. It\u2019s a good thing if there\u2019s dialogue and if such a meeting took place I would welcome it.   Updated at 12.13am BST    11.57pm    Most people in parliament would recognise this pharmacy (it is one of the closest to the parliament building). Anthony Albanese\u2019s team chose it for an announcement on cheaper medicines \u2013 a Labor election promise, with legislation to be introduced into the house today.    Updated at 12.00am BST    11.52pm    Greens MP continues push for national rent freeze Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather is trying to push the government to enact a policy to freeze public and private rents for two years, as well as putting a ban on evictions (something states did during the beginning of the pandemic). Chandler-Mather says the Scottish government has done it \u2013 so why can\u2019t Australia? \u201cMemo to Anthony Albanese, Scotland froze rents in the private rental market without \u2018nationalising all property\u2019 so maybe he can now drop the feigned ignorance act,\u201d he said.  There\u2019s a reason Scotland is freezing rents, because it works and it is exactly how you protect renters from unfair and massive rent increases. We\u2019ve got 2.7 million people in rental stress after rents have increased seven times faster than wages and it\u2019s only going to get worse. Now that Scotland has shown the way it is time for the federal government to finally start treating this once in a generation housing crisis seriously.\u201d The Victorian government has done it in the past, the Australian federal government froze rents in WWII and now Scotland is freezing rents, it\u2019s time the Australian Government froze rents and gave renters some much needed relief. On Tuesday the prime minister said the government\u2019s solution to the rental crisis was building 30,000 social and affordable homes over five years, and my question is what is the government going to do about the millions of renters his government\u2019s policy will leave behind, not to mention the half a million in need of social housing?   Updated at 11.57pm BST    11.35pm    Shrinking childcare workforce affects all industries, advocate says The Parenthood, an advocacy group for early childhood education, children and parental policy, are (not surprisingly) in support of the national day of action for early childhood education. Georgie Dent said:  It\u2019s estimated that Australia needs an additional 39,000 early educators by 2023. To realise the full increased productivity benefits of the Labor government\u2019s planned cheaper childcare package, we will need the equivalent of 9,650 full-time educators. But instead of growing, this workforce is shrinking. This is a problem for every other employer or organisation in the country. If a parent can\u2019t access care, they can\u2019t access work. We need to act now to stem the loss of early educators and do everything we can to attract Australians back into this profession. That\u2019s why we\u2019re supporting today\u2019s shut-down and calls from early educators for better pay and conditions. There is no doubt that children and parents not being able to access early learning and care will be disruptive. But if early educators don\u2019t get the respect, support and decent pay they deserve, they\u2019re going to continue to leave the profession and that will be far more disruptive than a day-long shut down.  The group outlines what fixing the workforce crisis in early learning will mean:  More educators can be securely employed in the sector. More places available for children so that parents can choose to return to work and ease other workforce shortages in teaching, nursing, aged care and more. More learning opportunities for children in the first five years.   Updated at 11.39pm BST    11.24pm    Bargaining system key to ensuring higher pay for care workers \u2013 Gallagher And on the national day of action for early childhood education workers, Katy Gallagher said:  This is an issue I\u2019m looking very closely with my minister for women\u2019s hat, predominantly overrepresented women \u2013 in the workforce and also it acts as a handbrake on women working more hours. I think the issue in the care economy is really substantial and again I don\u2019t have the single answer for how to fix it all, but we have got the issues with aged care workers, disability care workers, and early education and care workers, and how we manage that. This is part of why we\u2019re being talking about multi-employer bargaining because in the feminised sector, bargaining is broken, it doesn\u2019t work, and they haven\u2019t been getting the pay rises that they should be getting and so we have to look at how that system is working for female-dominated industries and the early education and care sector is a critical part of that. It\u2019s a growing part of that as is the care economy more broadly and we have got to work out a way through it. So we acknowledge \u2013 we want early child care educators to be well-paid and we think the answer to some degree lies with making sure the bargaining system works for women.   Updated at 11.32pm BST    11.22pm    Gallagher says Labor has not changed position on tax cuts And on the stage three tax cuts, Katy Gallagher echoed the line the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, started last week and continued yesterday \u2013 which is effectively Labor playing dead on the $243bn cuts:  I have been asked this a number of times. You know, we haven\u2019t changed our view on stage three. They don\u2019t come in until 2024. My sole focus at the moment is putting a budget together for October and what we can do in the short-term to relieve pressure on families. That is what I\u2019m focused on everyday. We haven\u2019t changed our view on stage three, but we are looking at what we can do in the short-term to ease some of those pressures on families in this really challenging environment where we have got rising interest rates and we\u2019re trying to deal with a high inflation environment.   Updated at 11.28pm BST    11.21pm    Finance minister says budget won\u2019t be fixed in short-term Katy Gallagher was asked this morning about Anthony Albanese\u2019s \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d in regards to the budget comment yesterday and told the ABC:  Well, the budget we inherited was heaving with a trillion dollars of Liberal party debt. We got deficits as far as the eye can see. We got some programs that weren\u2019t funded in an ongoing sense that clearly are programs that need ongoing funding. We have got a whole range of waste and rorts focus I\u2019m trying to look at, going through line by line. So some of those difficult decisions are how we reprioritise, how we make savings and how we make room for all of the other good ideas that people are coming forward with, including many of the good ideas that were discussed at the jobs and skills summit. So these are some of the difficult decisions that we are balancing up in the lead-up to October. But it won\u2019t end there. I mean, this \u2013 again, this budget situation is not going to be fixed in the short-term. These are going to be decisions that we have to make in an ongoing sense across the forward estimates because the budget is in such a difficult position and all of the kind of challenges, aged care, increased defence spending, the NDIS, servicing the debt that we have inherited, these are all programs that are going \u2013 growing very fast and we have to make room to manage them.   Updated at 11.31pm BST    11.19pm    Anthony Albanese has held a press conference \u2013 Josh Butler was there \u2013 and we will bring you some of that very soon.  Updated at 11.20pm BST    11.09pm   Aged care minister endorses multi-employer bargaining  The aged care minister, Anika Wells, has endorsed the difference multi-employer bargaining could make in her sector. Wells told Guardian Australia:  Aged care has a largely female workforce, and this measure could help women in care industries achieve better pay. Our government cares about closing the gender pay gap and we will get wages moving \u2013 particularly for women \u2013 by modernising Australia\u2019s workplace relations laws. There is a historic undervaluation of the work done in female-dominated occupations like aged care and multi-employer bargaining could help address that undervaluation. I have written to the Fair Work Commission asking for a pay rise for the aged care sector which will help close the gender pay gap. We have a bargaining system designed for large male dominated workplaces, locking women in feminised industries out of the system and it must change.   Updated at 11.15pm BST    11.08pm    As rates continue to rise economists predict slowdown With the Reserve Bank of Australia lifting its key interest rate on Tuesday to its highest level since early 2015, attention starts to turn now to what the bank\u2019s board will do when it next meets on 4 October. There\u2019s a strong expectation that the RBA has more hiking to come, with investors still leaning towards another \u201csuper-sized\u201d 50-basis point increase to 2.85% next month. (Economists think it\u2019s more likely to be a \u201cbite-sized\u201d 25 basis points.)  The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, had one stab at explaining his thinking in the statement accompanying yesterday\u2019s board decision. He will also be giving a speech in Sydney on Thursday from just after 1pm AEST on \u201cInflation and the Monetary Policy\u201d. One issue is the timing of big Australian Bureau of Statistics data is a bit staggered. The September quarter CPI numbers won\u2019t land until 26 October \u2013 a day after the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will release his first budget. The quarter\u2019s wage price index won\u2019t arrive until 16 November so the RBA\u2019s liaison team that gauges what companies are doing will be working overtime. Coming out today will be the June quarter national accounts, showing us how the economy fared in that quarter. Economists are expecting a quarterly GDP increase around the 0.8% to 1% mark and an annual rate of about 3.5% (or roughly in line with the 3.7% pace reported in the March quarter). We preview what\u2019s going on here, and why the June quarter might be as good as it gets for a while at least:  Of course, some things aren\u2019t so easily measured, such as the value of wildlife. Today also happens to be national threatened species day. Unfortunately, that\u2019s one metric that continually ticks up, as does the number of creatures great and small that are no longer with us.  Updated at 11.16pm BST    11.00pm    Penny Wong on funding offer to Solomon Islands yesterday Here is what Penny Wong said about it yesterday (also on Radio National). Patricia Karvelas: Let\u2019s move to the Solomon Islands. Does the government\u2019s offer to help fund the Solomon Islands election reflect concerns that prime minister Sogavare is planning to delay the poll? Wong: It reflects our longstanding and historical commitment to supporting democracy and democratic processes in Solomon Islands, and we\u2019ve previously offered support and we are offering support again. PK: What exactly have we offered in terms of assistance? How much money are we talking about and has the offer been accepted? Wong: Well, look, we have made an offer of assistance, and it\u2019s a matter for Solomon Islands as to whether they will respond and how they wish to respond. PK: So, they are yet to respond? Wong: We\u2019ve made an offer. PK: Is this a direct response to request for funding from the Solomon Islands opposition? Wong: No, this is because Australia has always and historically supported democracy in Solomon Islands. It\u2019s something through the Pacific we\u2019ve made offers previously for support for elections, just as obviously recently we were supportive of the Papua New Guinea election. So, this is a reasonably common approach that Australian governments have made over years. PK: And do you expect it to be received positively? Wong: Well, it\u2019s a matter for the government of Solomon Islands. Ultimately, they are a parliamentary democracy. I understand as you said in your, I think, earlier question there\u2019s legislation before the parliament that\u2019s domestically controversial. That\u2019s ultimately a matter for their parliament to resolve.  Updated at 11.04pm BST    10.57pm   Simon Birmingham questions Labor's communication with Solomon Islands  The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, is speaking to ABC RN about the Solomon Islands\u2019 government response. He says that it was \u201centirely appropriate\u201d Australia made the offer to help with election funding, but questions how it was communicated. Speaking to Patricia Karvelas, Birmingham said:  These are quite damning statements from the Solomon Islands government and there is much now to be answered by the Albanese government in terms of the way in which this offer was communicated [and] why it was revealed in the public way it was, when it was revealed.    Updated at 11.09pm BST    10.52pm   Solomon Islands PM accuses Australia of interfering in its democracy  Yesterday, the Albanese government\u2019s offer to help fund Solomon Islands\u2019 election became public, with Penny Wong confirming the offer had been made, after the government said it could not afford to hold an election and the Pacific Games in the same year. But the government, led by Manasseh Sogavare, has responded with a pretty strong rebuke, accusing Australia of \u2018interfering\u2019 with its democracy:  The timing of the public media announcement by the Australian government is in effect a strategy to influence how members of parliament will vote on this bill during the second reading on Thursday 8 September 2022. This is an assault on our parliamentary democracy and is a direct interference by a foreign government into our domestic affairs. The Solomon Islands government has conveyed to the Australian government its concern on the conduct of bilateral relations via the media through the Australian high commission office in Honiara.  The Solomon Islands opposition had accused Sogavare of attempting to hold on to power for another eight months (at least) by delaying the election, with the controversial legislation which would put off the poll until next year, due to be debated in the Solomon Islands parliament tomorrow. But the statement has kicked off the latest diplomatic squall between Australia and one of its Pacific neighbours.  Updated at 10.59pm BST    10.43pm    Early childhood educators to strike across the country If you have children in early childhood education, it\u2019s early childhood educators day. And that means it\u2019s also a day of action for the sector. Early childhood educators voted a month ago to take action today, giving warning to parents and asking for support as they fight for better pay and conditions. There is a march to parliament planned a little bit later today.  Updated at 10.45pm BST    10.27pm   Good morning  Happy Wednesday. There\u2019s no exclamation mark there because it doesn\u2019t deserve it. Today will be an absolute whirlwind as the government tries to get ahead of the \u201cdo something about cost of living\u201d calls with a couple of announcements \u2013 cheaper medicines (an election promise) and support for pensioners to downsize their homes to increase housing stock. But that won\u2019t help with the day to day costs. With rising inflation and rising interest rates it\u2019s left a lot of Australians in some pretty tight corners. Anthony Albanese warned of \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d in the upcoming budget in his speech to caucus yesterday which has people wondering whether there are more cuts planned or just not a lot of help on offer. Given inflation is expected to get worse before it gets better, and the Reserve Bank of Australia flagged more interest rate rises yesterday, there is going to be even more pressure on the government to do *something* to address it. The prime minister will be holding a press conference very soon and no doubt he\u2019ll be asked all about that. You have Sarah Martin, Josh Butler and Paul Karp covering all things Canberra today. Of course Mike Bowers is already on the hunt for what\u2019s going on. And I (Amy Remeikis) will be with you for most of the day. It\u2019s the Midwinter ball tonight \u2013 the first time it\u2019s been held since the pandemic \u2013 but the work won\u2019t stop. It\u2019s at least a five-coffee day. Ready? Because I\u2019m not. But let\u2019s get into it.  Updated at 10.29pm BST "

                    "body": "  3.46pm   Closing summary  Time to wrap up. Britain is facing the risk of stagflation after the Bank of England warned that surging energy prices will drive inflation to 10% by the end of the year as the economy stumbles. The pound plunged to its lowest since June 2020 as the BoE hiked borrowing costs to a 13-year high. Sterling has lost 2.5 cents since the start of the day, down 2%, on track for the worst day since March 2020. The BoE predicted that the economy could contract sharply in the last quarter of this year when the energy price cap is lifted, as the cost of living crisis hit household spending. Announcing its fourth rate rise in as many meetings, the BoE said:  Global inflationary pressures have intensified sharply following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. This has led to a material deterioration in the outlook for world and UK growth. These developments have exacerbated greatly the combination of adverse supply shocks that the United Kingdom and other countries continue to face. Concerns about further supply chain disruption have also risen, both due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and to Covid-19 developments in China.   The UK economy is also expected to shrink in 2023. Although it might not be a technical recession, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey agreed that the UK faces a \u2018very sharp slowdown\u2019.  Experts agreed that the UK was on the brink of a recession, and that stagnation worries were rising. Here\u2019s the full story:  Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains:  Just as in the 1970s, the Bank says external factors are mainly to blame. In 1973, it was the Yom Kippur war that led to 25% inflation by mid-1975. This time it is the war in Ukraine. The Bank is pencilling in another 40% increase in the energy price cap in October, taking the average annual household bill to \u00a32,800. There may be arguments about whether the UK is technically heading for recession because the Bank is not forecasting two consecutive quarters of falling output \u2013 but it will certainly feel like it. Living standards are about to take their biggest hit in decades. In another echo of yesteryear, sterling took a dive on the currency markets after the Bank\u2019s interest-rate decision.   The same energy prices which are hurting consumers drove Shell\u2019s profits to over $9bn in the first quarter of the year.          3.25pm     Our Money team have pulled together a round-up of what today\u2019s interest rate rise mean - here\u2019s a flavour:  1,092,000 Number of borrowers on a standard variable rate mortgage. These home loans have an interest rate set by the bank or building society. Some are explicitly linked to the base rate so will automatically go up in line with it, but others are set at the lender\u2019s discretion. \u00a3504 How much more a \u00a3200,000 variable rate mortgage will cost each year as a result of today\u2019s increase, according to figures from UK Finance. It says a 25 basis points rise in rates adds \u00a342 a month to repayments. 4.71% The average standard variable rate charged by UK mortgage lenders, according to Moneyfacts. In December 2021 this stood at 0.31%. It has not risen by as much as the base rate because not all lenders have moved in line with the base rate. 2.23% Lowest rate available on a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage currently. Available from Lloyds bank to people with a deposit of at least 40%. \u00a32.50 Extra interest earned on \u00a31,000 of savings \u2013 although do not assume the rate rise will be passed on to you, as in most cases it is up to the savings provider to decide whether to increase what it pays out. If your money is in a fixed-rate savings bond, you will definitely not see a rise in returns.  And here\u2019s the full piece:      3.21pm         3.03pm   Analysis: Recession the price Bank prepared to pay to bring UK inflation to heel  The Bank of England\u2019s grim forecasts have piled more pressure on UK chancellor Rishi Sunak to take action. With inflation seen hitting 10%, employment rising and the economy contracting in 2023, Sunak needs to do more to help households suffering a deepening cost of living crisis. Our economics editor Larry Elliott says.  Confronted with the dilemma of whether to worry more about the risks of recession or of inflation becoming embedded, the Bank has opted for a middle course, raising interest rates by a quarter point to 1% \u2013 their highest level since early 2009. But the vote was not unanimous: three of the nine members of the monetary policy committee wanted a half-point increase. Having been too optimistic about the economy in the past, the Bank may now be too gloomy. There are two reasons for that. The first is that Threadneedle Street\u2019s forecasts are based on what the financial markets think will happen to interest rates \u2013 and given the prospect of prolonged stagnation, the current City belief that borrowing costs will peak at 2.5% looks much too high. Some members of the MPC think no further tightening will be needed. The second reason is that it is hard to envisage the government watching the economy slide into recession without doing something to alleviate the pain. The Bank has upped the pressure on Rishi Sunak to act \u2013 and act big.  Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis:      2.52pm   Full story: Bank of England raises interest rates, warns of recession and 10% inflation  The Bank of England has warned that the cost of living crisis could plunge the economy into recession this year, as it increased interest rates to tackle soaring inflation that is expected to rise above 10% in the coming months. Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority to raise its base rate from 0.75% to 1%, lifting the cost of borrowing to the highest level in 13 years, as it sounded the alarm over the risks from spiralling inflation exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Despite the growing risks to the economy as households endured one of the biggest annual declines in their income for decades, the Bank said a quarter-point rise was warranted to block persistently high inflation from taking hold, as the shock from soaring energy costs rippled through the global economy. Issuing a downbeat verdict as voters went to the polls in local elections, the Bank predicted Britain was on track for years of meagre economic growth as people cut back their spending to deal with the heavy blow to living standards. Against a backdrop of soaring international energy prices, household gas and electricity bills are expected to rise by 40% in October, after the government offset only some of last month\u2019s record rise using measures outlined in Rishi Sunak\u2019s spring statement. With the chancellor under pressure to launch a fresh support package for householders, the Bank said consumers tightening their belts to deal with the cost of living crisis was likely to push the economy into a sharp contraction in the fourth quarter. Although a modest recovery is expected at the start of next year, ensuring two consecutive quarters of falling GDP (the technical definition of a recession) is likely to be avoided, the Bank warned Britain\u2019s economy would shrink by 0.25% over the course of 2023 as a whole, in effect a slow-burn recession.      2.39pm   UK recession risks: What the experts say  The \u2018cost of living crisis\u2019 means the UK may be on the brink of recession, warns Steven Bell, chief economist at BMO GAM:  Inflation is running well ahead of wages and the government has intensified the squeeze by raising taxes. In addition, the small army of people employed to tackle the pandemic is being disbanded. Real personal incomes are set to fall by 2.5% this year, the biggest decline since records began in 1947. The Bloomberg consensus survey of forecasts sees UK GDP in 2022Q2 increasing by only 0.2% compared with Q1.  Before the Ukraine war, that consensus was for a healthy 0.9% increase. Indeed, a significant minority are now expecting an outright fall in GDP in Q2 2022.  Katharine Neiss, chief European economist at PGIM Fixed Income says there is a risk the Bank could be pushed into setting even higher rates into a recession, as a falling pound pushes up inflation.  The BoE is in arguably the most difficult situation among major central banks. With inflation expected to peak in the double digits by year-end and growth likely to more than halve into next year, according to the central bank\u2019s latest forecasts, it is the prospect of prolonged above target inflation that is driving policy decisions for now.  James Smith of ING sees clear hints that the Bank\u2019s MPC committee thinks that is going to be too aggressive.  \u201cPolicymakers are clearly divided, and three voters opted for a 50bp move this time. It\u2019s clear that the committee is divided on just how concerned it should be about the tight jobs market, faster wage growth and elevated consumer inflation expectations. \u201cIn short, expect more hikes, but not as many as markets expect. We\u2019d already pencilled in another rate rise for June and we suspect on the basis of today\u2019s split decision, another one could follow in August. But the new forecasts, taken together with the increasing division among committee members, suggest the Bank is getting closer to a pause in its tightening cycle.\u201d      2.36pm    Newsnight\u2019s Ben Chu has produced some neat charts of the Bank\u2019s forecasts:          2.31pm    The minutes of the Bank\u2019s meeting highlight the split among policymakers as they try to curb inflation at the risk of pushing the economy into recession. They show that \u201cmost members of the Committee\u201d judged that some degree of further tightening might still be appropriate in the coming months, although views differed about the balance of risks. But some members of the Committee judged that the risks around activity and inflation over the policy horizon were \u201cmore evenly balanced and that such guidance was not appropriate at this juncture\u201d.     1.47pm   Pound slumps to near two-year low on stagflation worries  The pound has plunged, hitting its lowest level since June 2020, on growing fears that the UK could fall into recession. Sterling has slumped to $1.2375, down nearly nearly two and half cents today, on track for its worst day since March 2020, when the pandemic caused markets to crash.  You might expect a rise in interest rates to strengthen a currency, especially as three of the nine policymakers wanted a larger, 50 basis-point rise to 1.25%.  Instead, the split at the Bank of England, the sharp cut to growth forecasts, and the prospect of even higher inflation is hurting the pound. Matthew Ryan, senior market analyst at global financial service firm, Ebury, says the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee looks more divided on policy than we\u2019ve seen in some time.   The vote on interest rates was more hawkish than we had expected, with all nine members in support of an immediate hike and three in favour of a 50 basis point move. The bank\u2019s inflation assessment was also upgraded, with price growth now set to peak in excess of 10% later this year. \u201cThe MPC does, however, appear highly concerned about the impact of rising commodity prices on growth, and now expects the UK economy to contract in 2023. The tweaking of the bank\u2019s wording on future policy moves is all pretty vague and muddled, and suggests to us that policymakers are unsure on upcoming policy moves ahead of a potentially damaging period of \u2018stagflation\u2019. Sterling has reacted to the bank\u2019s lack of clarity, and indeed the threat of a UK recession, in a negative fashion and is currently back trading below the 1.24 level versus the US dollar.\u201d  Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, agrees that stagflation worries are hitting the pound:  The divided MPC thinks CPI will peak above 10% and the economy is facing a very sharp slowdown. The spilt in votes and uncertainty over inflation and growth puts rate setters in a tricky dilemma. Balancing inflation against growth will be very difficult. So, the key risk facing the UK is not necessarily tighter policy, but uncertainty over monetary policy and, more to the point, stagflation. As fears grow that the UK is heading for a contraction in output, amid rising prices domestically and abroad, weak growth in eurozone due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and China\u2019s lockdowns, this should keep the pound\u2019s upside limited.    Updated at 2.08pm BST    1.31pm    Q: You\u2019ve been cautious about using the term \u2018stagflation\u2019 - but this is stagflation, isn\u2019t it? How worried should households be? Bailey says he avoids the term, as it doesn\u2019t have a good definition.  \u201cThe main reason I don\u2019t tend to use the word is that it is not in my view very well-defined.   [An economy facing double-digit inflation and the risk of a contraction doesn\u2019t sound like the worst definition, though...]      1.18pm         1.18pm    Q: What do you say to struggling households who will feel you\u2019ve just given them another kick? Bailey says some people think the Bank should raise interest rates even higher. He doesn\u2019t, so policy is \u2018calibrated\u2019 to reflect the balance of risks. The Bank has also revised up its forecast for wage growth, he expains, saying that companies tell him they\u2019ve \u2018really struggling\u2019 to hire staff.  The conversation with businesses often goes \u2018well I know you say there is going to be this big downturn in the economy\u2019 but it is not coming from where they see it, and their real concern is they just can\u2019t hire enough people to meet the demand they have today.\u201d      1.13pm    Q: When you say there\u2019s nothing the Bank can do to protect people from this hit, as you saying \u2018over to you, chancellor\u2019? Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank never advises government on policy, it is simply pointing out that monetary policy has its limits.     1.11pm    Q: Is the pain that households are facing the only way to get inflation down? Is it medicine we need to take? Andrew Bailey explains that the shock to real incomes (from the surge in prices) will be the main downward driver on inflation, rather than monetary policy.  The biggest driver is the real income shock which is coming from the change in the terms of trade, particularly from energy prices, and from some core goods and some food.       1.05pm    The hit to incomes in the UK from surging energy and imported goods costs are \u201cunavoidable\u201d, warns deputy governor Ben Broadbent. Monetary policy (changing interest rates) cannot offset it, he explains.  Broadbent says the Ofgem energy cap is likely to increase by around \u00a31,500 during 2022 (April\u2019s rise, plus the one coming in October), on top of a \u00a3300 increase in 2021. You can double that hit, if you add the increase in imported goods prices due to the Ukraine war. In contrast, the impact of raising interest rates on mortgage costs is a fraction, perhaps just a tenth, he adds.   Updated at 1.05pm BST    12.59pm         12.55pm    Onto questions: Q: Your forecasts looks very much like a recession, so how can you justify exacerbating the pressures on households and businesses in the cost of living crisis? BoE Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank\u2019s forecast show a \u201cvery sharp slowdown\u201d, although not a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth). Explaining today\u2019s rate rise, Bailey says the Bank is walking a very narrow path, and cites two risks.  First, the UK\u2019s very tight labour market, and the pressure on wages as firms struggle to hire staff.  Second, the question of how savings build up during the pandemic will be used.     12.46pm    Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is holding a press conference now. He explains that inflationary pressures have \u2018intensified sharply\u2019 since the Ukraine war began, and that Russia\u2019s invasion has led to a material deterioration in the global economic outlook. With inflation already well over the Bank\u2019s 2% target, the risks to inflation are skewed to the upside, Bailey says. But when CPI inflation falls it will fall rapidly, he predicts.     12.39pm   UK economy to shrink in 2023, warns Bank of England  The Bank of England\u2019s latest forecasts show there is a serious risk of the UK falling into recession, as it hikes interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation. The Bank latest forecasts imply UK GDP could fall by nearly 1% in the final quarter of this year, when the energy price cap is lifted again (taking inflation to 10% this autumn). Next year looks alarmingly weak too. The Bank has cut its growth forecast for 2023 to show a contraction of 0.25%, from a previous estimate of 1.25% growth.  It cut its growth projection for 2024 to just 0.25%, from a previous forecast of 1.0%. My colleague Richard Partington has the details:   Here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam:        12.27pm    UK households face an even more painful squeeze on their living standards than forecast three months ago: The Bank of England warns that the surge in energy and goods price will have a material impact on disposable incomes, with inflation taking an even bigger bite:  UK GDP growth was expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period. That predominantly reflected the significant adverse impact of the sharp rises in global energy and tradable goods prices on most UK households\u2019 real incomes and many UK companies\u2019 profit margins. Total real household disposable income was projected to fall by 1\u00be% in 2022, which was a greater fall than in the February projection. Four-quarter consumption growth was expected to slow materially over the first half of the forecast period.    Updated at 12.28pm BST    12.10pm   Bank: Inflation to hit 10%  The Bank of England has warned that UK inflation is going to hit 10% before the end of the year. Explaining today\u2019s increase in interest rates to 1%, the Bank warns that it sees double-digit inflation looming. Consumer price inflation, which hit 7% in March, is expected to hit 9% in April due to the jump in the energy price cap.  It is then seen peaking \u201cslightly over 10%\u201d in the last quarter of 2022, when energy bills are likely to rise again in October. That will mean an even worse cost of living squeeze for millions of households. The Bank says:  As economies around the world opened up after Covid restrictions eased, people started to buy more goods. But the people selling these have had problems getting enough of them to sell to customers. That led to higher prices \u2013 particularly for goods imported from abroad.  Higher energy prices have also played a big role. Large increases in oil and gas prices have pushed up petrol prices and energy bills. Services inflation is picking up a little. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has led to more increases in the prices of energy and food.  We expect inflation to rise further to around 10% this year.  Prices are likely to rise faster than income for many people. That means that people will be able to buy less with their money. The UK economy has been recovering from the effects of Covid, but we expect the increased cost of living to lead to slower growth overall.  The Bank of England can\u2019t do anything about the global supply problems or the energy prices that are currently pushing up inflation. But we do have tools to make sure inflation comes back down to our 2% target. The main tool we use to bring inflation down is to increase interest rates. We raised the UK\u2019s most important interest rate (Bank Rate) from 0.1% to 0.25% in December 2021, to 0.5% in February 2022, and then again to 0.75% in March.  This month we have raised Bank Rate to 1%. We expect inflation to fall back next year and be close to our target in around two years.   Updated at 12.13pm BST    12.05pm   BoE raises interest rates to 1%  The Bank of England raised interest rates to their highest since 2009, despite concerns that the UK economy risks falling into recession. The BoE\u2019s nine rate-setters voted 6-3 to raise Bank rate by a quarter-point to 1%, from 0.75%, due to the rise in inflation to 30-year highs.  But three policymakers - Catherine Mann, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders - called for a bigger increase to 1.25% to stamp out the risk of the inflation surge getting embedded in the economy.

An SEC filing shows that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is providing $1bn, with a string of others including crypto trading firm Binance ($500m), Sequoia Capital ($800m) and Qatar Holding ($375m) also on board. Also, existing investor Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, will roll 35 million shares into the bid vehicle. That stake is worth $1.9bn at Musk\u2019s offer price.  At the same time, Musk\u2019s margin loan, secured on some of his stake in Tesla, has been reduced to $6.25bn from $12.5bn announced earlier.  The filing also shows that Musk will keep talking other shareholders, including former CEO Jack Dorsey, to contribute shares to the proposed acquisition.    Updated at 2.46pm BST    11.37am   UK business activity slows to three-month low  Growth across the UK services sector has dropped to its lowest in three months - another warning light flashing on the economic dashboard. The UK Composite PMI Output Index, which measures activity at UK companies, dipped to 58.2 in April from 60.9 in March. That still shows growth, but the slowest since the start of the year. New order growth hit at a four-month low, and confidence fell. UK companies also hiked their prices at the fastest pace on record - in response to a record jump in their own costs. The report, by S&amp;P Global and CIPS, says:  The slowdown reflected intense cost pressures and the war in Ukraine. In fact, input costs rose at the fastest pace in the history of the series which stretches back more than 24 years. Accordingly, output charges also increased at a record pace. Strong inflation was seen across both sectors, but was more pronounced in manufacturing. Companies continued to expand staffing levels rapidly in April, albeit at a softer pace. Meanwhile, business confidence dropped to the lowest in a year-and-a-half.  The services sector, which makes up around three-quarters of the economy, was hit by a sharp slowdown in new business.   Andrew Harker, Economics Director at S&amp;P Global, explains:  \u201cThe twin headwinds of the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine started to bite on the UK service sector during April, as evidenced by a sharp slowdown in new order growth to the lowest in the year so far. Worryingly, companies seem to be expecting impacts to be prolonged, with business confidence dropping to the lowest in a year-and-a-half.        11.33am   German factory orders fall as global economy weakens  German factory orders havs slumped, as the Ukraine war disrupts supply chains and adds to inflationary pressures. Demand for Made In Germany goods plunged 4.7% in March from the previous month, driven by a decline in orders from overseas.  That\u2019s worse than the 1.1% drop forecast, and indicates the global economy is weakening as the rising energy and commodity prices drive up inflation.       10.52am    Overnight, China\u2019s services sector has recorded the second-steepest drop in activity on record, as tighter Covid-19 restrictions hit the industry. The Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index, which tracks the state of the economy, plummeted to 36.2 in April from 42 in March. Firms reported a sharper fall in new business and employment, amid new lockdowns and other restrictions. Any reading below 50 shows contraction, and this is the fastest decline since the start of the pandemic.      10.23am    Shares in publishing group Reach have tumbled 20% after it reported a drop in advertising revenues as brands tried to avoid appearing next to articles about the Ukraine war. Reach, which has over 130 national and regional brands in print and online including the Daily Mirror and Daily Express, reported that print revenues fell 4.2% in the four months to 24 April, while advertising revenue shrank 10.1%. Reach says:  Over the past two months the market has experienced reduced advertiser demand and lower average yields, with the war in Ukraine significantly reducing the level of \u2018brand safe\u2019 content for news publishers.   Digital growth slowed, with revenue up by 9.3% year-on-year, compared with growth above 25% during 2021. Reach adds that costs (such as energy and newsprint) have also risen:   We still anticipate broadly flat group revenue for the year, though with a higher mix of circulation revenues and lower digital contribution than previously expected as a result of more challenging trading conditions. The impact of further recent newsprint inflation is fully reflected in our cost expectations for the current financial year, with actions now underway to help mitigate the impact on operating profit.        9.57am   UK auto sector cuts 2022 sales forecast amid cost of living squeeze  The SMMT also warns that the squeeze on household incomes and geopolitical uncertainty will both hit car sales this year, as it lowered its sales forecast for this year.   The sector faces further economic headwinds, with rising inflation, not least due to the spiralling energy and fuel costs squeezing household incomes, and further supply chain and other uncertainties arising from the global political situation and the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. More positively, however, drivers able to invest in a new vehicle can still reap benefits, as interest rates remain historically low, grants for BEVs will be in place until at least early 2023, and running costs associated with new electric cars are generally lower than those of petrol or diesel.       9.48am   UK car sales fall as supply problems hit sector  UK car sales fell almost 16% last month, as shortages of key parts such as computer chips continue to hit production. New car registrations declined by 15.8% year-on-year in April to 119,167 units, according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The SMMT has also slashed its forecast for sales this year, due to semiconductor shortages and the cost of living crisis.  It says:  Despite showrooms being open for the entire month, unlike the previous year which saw lockdown restrictions in place until 12 April, global supply chain shortages, of which semiconductors are the most notable, have continued to constrain the delivery of new vehicles.   Battery electric car registrations rose 40.9% year-on-year to 12,899, and now make up 10% of the market, while diesel registrations halved year-on-year to 6,725, and only makes up 5.6% of sales. The SMMT now expects just 1.72m new registrations this year, down from 1.89m forecast before. That\u2019s just 4.5% more than in 2021, due to supply chain constraints and broader macro-economic factors.  Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, explains:  \u201cThe worldwide semiconductor shortage continues to drag down the market, with global geopolitical issues threatening to undermine both supply and demand in the coming months.    Updated at 9.54am BST    9.28am    Shell has also reported higher earnings at its renewables and energy solutions division, which is crucial to its transition to clean energy.  The unit made an adjusted net profit of $344m in January-March, up from $43m in Q4 2021, and a loss of $102m in the first quarter of last year. That\u2019s dwarfed by its fossil fuel divisions, though, with oil production generating $3.5bn of adjusted earnings and gas making $4.1bn profits in the quarter. Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:  Calls for a windfall tax have been rebuffed by claims that the majors will start to clean up their acts, spending some of the excess to build out their renewables divisions. This quarter was the first time we got a glimpse of how well this part of Shell\u2019s business is functioning, and it was encouraging to see underlying profits were on the up.  Renewables are likely to become a much larger slice of the pie as the energy transition ramps up, Hoy adds:  This technology is largely unproven, so oil and gas investors that have become accustomed to generous returns are taking a leap of faith. If the group\u2019s able to build out this part of the business to become a reliable profit driver while oil prices are still high, it would make the transition all the smoother.\u201d      9.05am    Over in Turkey, inflation has surged to a 20-year high of almost 70%. Consumer price inflation jumped to 69.97% per year in April, driven by the rally in global energy prices, and domestic food costs following the slump in the lira. Energy inflation climbed to 118.2% from 102.9% in March, while food prices were 89% pricier than a year ago.  Prices charged by factories also more-than-doubled over the last year, with producer price inflation around 122%.   Turkey was already facing soaring inflation after its central bank cut interest rates several times, weakening the lira, under pressure from president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to stimulate the economy.  The Ukraine war has made the situation even worse, as Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Bar\u0131\u015f Narl\u0131 wrote last month:  Turkey\u2019s financial crisis has been further compounded by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has driven up global food prices, particularly for wheat. The lira\u2019s slide against the dollar was already affecting Turkey\u2019s ability to import wheat, but the loss of Ukrainian supplies has left it scrambling to find alternatives, including dipping into its own reserves. \u2018I paid a 1,000 lira electricity bill in February, just for these two machines,\u201d says Mehmet Aslan, pointing at two refrigerators holding cured meat, cheese and plump yellow rounds of butter from the town of Rize, where his family comes from (as does Erdo\u011fan\u2019s). Last Ramadan, Aslan says his shop was bringing in 6,000-7,000 lira a day in sales; this year he\u2019s lucky if it breaks 1,500 lira. \u201cPeople are making up prices,\u201d he adds, pointing to a large jar of honey. \u201cI could just make that 400 lira [\u00a321] and no one would say anything. I could even make it 500.\u201d       8.44am   Full story: Shell profits soar to $9.1bn amid calls for windfall tax  Shell has reported a record quarterly profit of $9.1bn for the first three months of the year, piling more pressure on the government to implement a windfall tax to fund measures to tackle soaring household energy bills, our energy correspondent Alex Lawson writes: The first-quarter profit was boosted by a sharp rise in oil and gas prices, and compared with $6.3bn of profits in the final three months of 2021 and $3.2bn during the first quarter of last year. It was above analysts\u2019 expectations of first-quarter adjusted earnings of $8.7bn. Campaigners have called for a one-off levy on companies benefitting from soaring oil and gas prices to fund government initiatives to reduce the burden of rising bills. Shell said it had taken a $3.9bn hit after it ditched its Russian investments after the invasion of Ukraine in February. The UK oil firm is negotiating an exit from the huge Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project north of Japan, in which it has a 27.5% stake. It is also divesting Nord Stream 2, a venture with the Russian gas company Gazprom. Here\u2019s the full story:      8.43am    TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says:  \u201cThese eye-watering profits are an insult to hard-working families. \u201cWhile millions of households struggle with soaring bills, oil and gas companies are having a bonanza. \u201cThe likes of Shell and BP are treating the British public like a giant cash machine. \u201cThe government must act now. The case for a windfall tax has become unanswerable.\u201d  Back in November 2021, BP\u2019s boss Bernard Looney actually said soaring global commodity prices have made his company a \u201ccash machine\u201d, when the global recovery from Covid-19 lockdowns was pushing oil prices up.     8.34am    Shares in Shell have hit their highest level in over two years in early trading, after it beat profit forecasts. Shell are up 3.3% at around \u00a323 each, the highest since January 2020 before the Covid-19 pandemic hit demand for energy.  The wider market is also higher, with the FTSE 100 up 1.4%.     8.20am    The government\u2019s refusal to impose a windfall tax on oil company\u2019s surging profits is \u2018completely unforgivable\u2019, says Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey:  Ministers have claimed a windfall tax would hurt investment - but that argument has been undermined by BP CEO Bernard Looney. He told The Times this week that BP would continue an \u00a318bn investment plan even if the government bowed to calls for a tax. Although, as our financial editor Nils Pratley explained this week, a windfall tax on North Sea would not solve the energy crisis facing households on its own:  Indeed, just by considering the back-of-the-envelope arithmetic, one can see why the financial dial wouldn\u2019t move. The little secret about the Labour party\u2019s version of windfall tax is that it is very modest. The formula imagines an increase from 40% to 50% in the tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits, which in BP\u2019s case would merely turn an expected \u00a31bn tax bill for the relevant assets this year into one of \u00a31.25bn.... By the same token, though, Labour should stop giving the impression that a windfall tax is some form of cure-all for the crisis in consumers\u2019 energy bills. On the party\u2019s original January formulation of its tax, the projected total from across the entire North Sea industry was just \u00a31.2bn. Even if one assumes that a higher oil price (and thus corporate profits) would add a bit, we\u2019re not talking about game-changing sums. For context, it would cost \u00a310bn to give 10m lower-income households a \u00a31,000 saving on their bills for a single year.        8.07am    Shell has also returned billions of dollars to investors so far this year, a time in which millions of households have fallen into \u2018fuel stress\u2019, unable to pay their energy bills. Total shareholder distributions in the last quarter were $5.4bn, Shell says.  That includes $4bn of the $8.5bn share buyback announced in February. It expects remaining $4.5bn will be completed before its second quarter 2022 results at the end of July. It also lifted its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, up from $0.17 in Q1 2021, and $0.24 in Q4 2021. Will Hares, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, has crunched the numbers:   Updated at 9.07am BST    7.44am    Shell\u2019s chief executive officer, Ben van Beurden, says:  \u201cThe war in Ukraine is first and foremost a human tragedy, but it has also caused significant disruption to global energy markets and has shown that secure, reliable and affordable energy simply cannot be taken for granted.  The impacts of this uncertainty and the higher cost that comes with it are being felt far and wide. We have been engaging with governments, our customers and suppliers to work through the challenging implications and provide support and solutions where we can. Generating value through strong earnings and cash flow, coupled with maintaining a healthy balance sheet and continuing the disciplined delivery of our strategy, are crucial for Shell to play a leading role in the energy transition. This allows us to support our customers as they shift to cleaner energy. It\u2019s also the best way for us to contribute to the security of energy supplies.        7.33am   Introduction: Shell profits triple; BoE rate hike today?  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Oil giant Shell has almost tripled its quarterly profits, as the surge in oil and gas prices drive up earnings and intensify calls for a windfall tax on excess profits. Shell recorded adjusted earnings of $9.13bn (\u00a37.25bn) in the first quarter of this year, its latest quarterly results show.  That\u2019s almost three times the $3.2bn it made in the same quarter a year earlier, and 43% higher than in the last quarter of 2021 - and even more than analysts had forecast.  Shell says the increase in earnings is mainly due to higher energy prices, a strong performance by its trading arm, and lower operating expenses and tax, partly offset by lower volumes.  The group has also taken a $3.9bn charge related to \u201cthe phased withdrawal from Russian oil and gas activities\u201d. Shell is no longer buying Russian oil on the spot market (after apologising for buying one shipment in March), but will continue to fulfil contracts on buying fuel from Russia signed before the invasion of Ukraine.  It says it is making an:  Orderly withdrawal from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and LNG in a phased manner, aligned with new government guidance. Since these announcements, Shell has stopped all spot purchases of Russian crude, liquefied natural gas, and of cargoes of refined products directly exported from Russia. Shell will not renew long-term contracts for Russian oil, unless under explicit government direction, but is still legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion. By the end of this year, all of Shell\u2019s long-term 3rd party purchases of Russian crude will stop, except for two contracts with a small, independent Russian producer. All of Shell\u2019s contracts to purchase refined products exported from Russia will also end.  Shell adds, though, that it still has \u201clong-term contractual commitments\u201d for Russian liquidied natural gas (LNG).  Reducing European reliance on piped natural gas supplies from Russia is also a very complex challenge that requires concerted action by governments, as well as energy suppliers and customers.    Soaring energy prices pushed UK inflation to a 30-year high of 7% in March, and some economists fear it could hit 10% this year, intensifying the cost of living crisis. Those pressures mean the Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates today to the highest level in 13 years, despite worrying signs that the economy is slowing.  The City predicts the BoE will vote for a quarter-point rise, lifting base rate from 0.75% to 1%, which would be the fourth rise in as many meetings, as it tries to dampen down inflationary pressures. John Hardy, Head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank, explains:  The BoE feels that the outlook for real growth in the UK is very poor, driven by a drop in real incomes and that it is tightening its policy as a necessity linked to intolerably-high inflation.  But could hiking today be a policy error, if the economy is faltering?  Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg, says there are reasons to be cautious:  \u201cAmid plunging consumer confidence and evidence of a pullback in household demand, [raising rates] is not without risk, in our view. \u201cIf we are unlucky, the UK is already in the early stage of a recession.\u201d  The Bank will also publish new economic forecasts, which may show slower growth and rising inflation than expected three months ago, with UK households facing the fastest fall in living standards since the mid-1950s. Here\u2019s our preview on the Bank\u2019s decision:  Last night, America\u2019s central bank announced its biggest interest rate rise in 22 years, as it lifted US interest rates by 50 basis points, to a range of 0.75% to 1%,  Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell also signalled the Fed could implement further 50bp increases at future meetings, as it takes a more aggressive approach to tackling high inflation. Powell explained:  Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we\u2019re moving expeditiously to bring it back down. We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.    But Powell also said the FOMC wasn\u2019t \u201cactively considering\u201d a 75bp jump, which calmed fears of a steep rate hike next month.  Shares surged on Wall Street, with the S&amp;P 500 recorded its biggest one-day percentage gain in nearly two years.  European markets are expected to rally too.  Other central banks, including India and Brazil, raised rates on Wednesday, in a global battle against inflation.

This was a big topic today, showing that in case of a full disruption of gas flows from Russia, gas is indeed allowed to flow to wherever it is needed in Europe.\nThe second topic was defence.

The deputy chair of Russia\u2019s security council, which is headed by Putin and advises the president on national security, wrote:\n\n The conclusion suggests itself disgusting \u2013 these sanctions are directed precisely against the people of Russia. And no matter what American and European grandparents mutter that we are punishing your bosses, but we love you, ordinary citizens, is pure nonsense. What is the purpose of the arrest of assets of the Central Bank of Russia and other state assets? Simple. To make the economy worse, to hit the rouble, increase inflation and unwind prices in stores, which means dropping the standard of living of an ordinary Russian. An embargo on the purchase of oil and gas from Russia? The same thing: to reduce budget revenues and force the state to abandon social obligations, including indexation of incomes.

According to the European Council president, Charles Michel, three-quarters of Russian oil imports will be immediately affected, rising to 90% by the end of the year.\nWhich countries have been exempted and why?\nThe EU is banning seaborne oil immediately, which covers about two-thirds of Russian imports to the EU. Oil transported through the critical Druzhba (\u201cfriendship\u201d) pipeline will be exempt from the ban, a key concession to Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil.\nHow will the embargo affect Russia\u2019s war machine?\nThe EU is paying Russia about \u20ac1bn a day for oil and gas, an invaluable source of hard currency for the Kremlin in funding its war against Ukraine. A sharp cut in those financial flows deepens Russia\u2019s economic problems in the long term. \nWhat will the impact be on consumers and businesses in Europe?\nMotorists and businesses will see higher prices at the pumps, as the embargo feeds into higher oil prices. \nRead more of Jennifer Rankin\u2019s explainer here: What does EU\u2019s partial oil ban mean for Russia and rest of Europe?\n\n\n\n\n 11.02am  \nToday so far \u2026\n\n\nUkraine is still in control of some parts of Sievierodonetsk city and its soldiers are fighting slowly advancing Russian troops, but evacuations of civilians are not currently possible, the head of the city\u2019s administration has said.

They cannot move freely through the city \u2013 our fighters still remain in the settlement.\u201d\nEU leaders have backed a partial embargo on Russian oil after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels. The sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports with the aim to ban 90% of all Russian oil imported to Europe by the end of the year, officials said. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a \u201cremarkable achievement\u201d that would place \u201cmaximum pressure on Russia to end the war\u201d. The compromise excludes the Druzhba pipeline from the oil embargo and exempts deliveries arriving in Europe by pipeline, after Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n warned halting supplies would wreck his country\u2019s economy. Russia has hit back at the EU\u2019s latest round of sanctions on oil imports, saying Moscow will find other importers.\nThe latest sanctions package also includes removing access to Swift payments for Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against \u201cindividuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine\u201d.\nThe sanctions on Russia, which ban most imports of its oil, are \u201cnot enough\u201d and the pace of sanctions so far has been too slow, a senior official in the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, Ihor Zhovkva, said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier lamented the delay in EU leaders imposing heavier sanctions against Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe pause in agreeing on new sanctions in Europe has been too long,\u201d he said.\nZelenskiy claims that Russia is blocking the export of 22m tons of grain from Ukraine\u2019s ports and warned it posed a threat of famine. \u201cRussia\u2019s blockade of our exports is destabilising the situation on a global scale,\u201d he said in his latest national address. Zelenskiy added that Russian forces \u201chave already stolen at least half a million tons of grain\u201d and \u201care now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere\u201d.\nA Ukrainian court sentenced two captured Russian soldiers to 11-and-a-half years in jail for shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, the second war crimes verdict since the start of Russia\u2019s latest invasion in February.\nThe Russian ministry of defence claims to have shot down an Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force and destroyed the Ukrainian battery of the Uragan multiple launch rocket system, the battery of the Grad multiple launch rocket system, two ammunition depots, and a fuel depot in overnight operations.\nThe ministry also, without providing evidence, said that it had recovered 152 bodies of Ukrainian fighters from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol that had been booby-trapped with mines \u201con direct orders from Kyiv\u201d to create a \u201cprovocation\u201d.\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will visit Turkey with a military delegation next week on 8 June.\nOleg Kryuchkov, who is an advisor to the Russian-appointed government in annexed Crimea, has said that the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions have switched to using Russian mobile communications and internet networks.\nA ship loaded with metal has left the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, becoming the first to do so since the besieged Ukrainian city was taken by Russian forces. Ukraine said the shipment amounted to looting.\nThe European Council has said it is ready to grant Ukraine \u20ac9bn to aid in its post-war reconstruction. The Council will \u201ccontinue helping Ukraine with its immediate liquidity needs, together with G7\u201d European Council President Charles Michel said late on Monday night.\n\nThat is it from me, Martin Belam, for now.

We thought about patriotism in terms of politics \u2013 if you care for your country you try to make it better. So I tried. For over a decade I went to all the opposition rallies, I protested against injustice. Like-minded people and I tried our best to make our country a better place. But I never fell for the patriotic mantras about how great Russia is or how great it used to be and should be again.\nWhy should I be proud that the Soviet Union was the first country to launch a man into space? Yuri Gagarin or Sergei Korolev should be proud of that, it was their achievement, not mine. Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union won the great patriotic war? My grandfathers fought in it. The war broke them, but they won: they should be proud of that. I know they were.

Let me remind you that before being taken prisoner, the Azov command publicly appealed to Zelenskiy to take the bodies of the dead so that the families could bury them in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime.\nHowever, no requests from Kyiv to receive the bodies of the dead from the Azovstal plant have been received. Moreover, during the inspection of the van, Russian sappers found four mines placed under the bodies of the dead Ukrainian servicemen. The cumulative mass of the explosive in them was sufficient to destroy all the remains of the bodies remaining in the van.\nBased on the results of interrogations of captured Azov militants, it is known that the mining of the bodies was carried out on direct orders from Kyiv.\nThe purpose of the provocation is to accuse Russia of deliberately destroying the remains of the bodies and preventing them from being taken out for transfer to relatives in order to save the political \u2018reputation\u2019 of the Kyiv regime and Zelenskiy personally.\nIn the near future, the Russian side plans to hand over the bodies of Ukrainian militants and servicemen found on the territory of the Azovstal plant to representatives of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.40am BST\n\n\n 9.22am  \n\nThere are some additional quotes from Latvia\u2019s prime minister Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 from Brussels this morning.

The assesment says:\n\nRussia\u2019s capture of Lyman supports its operational main effort, which likely remains the encirclement of Sieverodonetsk and the closure of the pocket around Ukrainian forces in Luhansk Oblast.\nHeavy shelling continues, while street fighting is likely taking place on the outskirts of Sieverodonetsk town.\nRoutes into the pocket likely remain under Ukrainian control. Russia has achieved greater local successes than earlier in the campaign by massing forces and fires in a relatively small area.

The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a \u201cremarkable achievement\u201d that would place \u201cmaximum pressure on Russia to end the war\u201d. The compromise excludes the Druzhba pipeline from the oil embargo and exempts deliveries arriving in Europe by pipeline, after Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n warned halting supplies would wreck his country\u2019s economy.\nThe latest sanctions package also includes removing access to Swift payments for Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against \u201cindividuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine\u201d.\nEuropean Council president Charles Michel addressed speculation of disunity within the EU in the days leading up to the agreement. \u201cIn the recent hours and recent days there was speculation about a lack of European unity,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe do not underestimate all the difficulties. We know that we needed a few weeks before we were able to take a decision.\u201d\nUkraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier lamented the delay in EU leaders imposing heavier sanctions against Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe pause in agreeing on new sanctions in Europe has been too long,\u201d he said.\nThe European Council added it is ready to grant Ukraine \u20ac9bn to aid in its postwar reconstruction. The Council will \u201ccontinue helping Ukraine with its immediate liquidity needs, together with the G7\u201d European Council President Charles Michel said late on Monday night. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that Ukraine needed \u20ac5bn a month just to maintain basic services and \u201c \u2026 to give Ukraine a fair chance to rise from the ashes\u201d.\nZelenskiy claims that Russia is blocking the export of 22m tons of grain from Ukraine\u2019s ports and warned it posed a threat of famine. \u201cRussia\u2019s blockade of our exports is destabilising the situation on a global scale,\u201d he said in his latest national address. Zelenskiy added that Russian forces \u201chave already stolen at least half a million tons of grain\u201d and \u201care now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere\u201d.\nThe situation in Donbas remains \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, Zelenskiy said, adding that Russian troops shelled Kharkiv again on Monday. \u201cThe territory of our Sumy region was also shelled across the border between Ukraine and Russia,\u201d he said.\nRussian tanks and troops begun advancing into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held by Ukraine, bringing fighting to the streets on Monday. The regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, described \u201cheavy battles\u201d and said the fighting was \u201cvery fierce\u201d.\nRussian president Vladimir Putin spoke with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, saying if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could \u201cexport significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products\u201d.\nJoe Biden has said the US will not supply Ukraine with long-range rockets capable of reaching Russia. Ukraine has asked for multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) with a range of about 300km (185 miles) to offset Moscow\u2019s increasingly effective use of long-range artillery.\nFrance is set to boost military aid to Ukraine. Foreign minister Catherine Colonna said France will \u201ccontinue to reinforce arms deliveries\u201d while visiting Kyiv on Monday.\nBelarus will conduct military mobilisation exercises in June and July in the Gomel region, state news agency BelTA reports.\nRussia will stop supplying gas to the Netherlands as of tomorrow after the government-backed trader GasTerra refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. About 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures.\nThe Georgian breakaway region of South Ossetia has scrapped plans to hold a referendum on joining Russia which had been scheduled for 17 July. The Moscow-controlled enclave\u2019s president Alan Gagloev warned of the \u201cuncertainty of the legal consequences of the issue submitted to a referendum,\u201d according to a report from Agence France-Presse.\nFrench journalist, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclerc-Imhoff, 32, has been killed after an armoured evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in the city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian and French authorities have said. France has called for an investigation into the reporter\u2019s death as Zelenskiy offered his \u201csincere condolences\u201d to his colleagues and family.\nThe first alleged case of rape by a Russian soldier has been sent to court, the prosecutor general of Ukraine said. The serviceman will be tried for the alleged murder of the victim\u2019s husband and \u201csexual violence against his wife\u201d, Iryna Venediktova said.\nThe Eurovision song contest winners Kalush Orchestra auctioned off their trophy to raise money for the Ukrainian army.The band, whose song Stefania was triumphant in Turin earlier this month, said they raised $900,000 (\u00a3713,000) by auctioning off the glass microphone and a further $370,000 by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh Psiuk wore during the performance.\n\n\n\n"

But before we go, let\u2019s recap the big stories:   The Australian Energy Market Operator suspended the spot market for electricity nationally for the first time, and New South Wales residents were asked to reduce power in the evening if safe. The RBA boss, Philip Lowe, announced inflation could hit 7%. Sarah Hanson-Young said Australia was being \u201cheld hostage\u2019 by energy companies. Bill Shorten highlighted the wider economic benefits of NDIS. Derryn Hinch confirmed he will run for parliament in Victoria. Brisbane says it will increase council rates on short-stay rental properties to help address housing crisis. The Fair Work Commission ruled on 5.2% increase to minimum wage, which was welcomed by the ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, welcomed the increase while the chamber of commerce boss said wages should be flexible and \u201cdriven by the market\u201d. Consumer sentiment plunged towards historic low, according to a Westpac survey. Blackstone\u2019s takeover of Crown Resorts approved by federal court.  Thank you for spending today with us \u2013 we will be back again tomorrow!   Updated at 10.31am BST    10.07am    Plans to rewild captive koalas in New South Wales A new project aims to \u201crewild\u201d captive koalas by gently releasing them into larger sanctuaries, AAP reports. The plan is to house the endangered marsupials at a breeding site near a NSW national park before releasing them into a safe, 1,500-hectare wild sanctuary in the state\u2019s north. The goal is to equip the animals with the necessary skills to flourish in a wild environment \u2013 called \u201cwild translocation\u201d. Conservation groups WildArk and Aussie Ark aim to launch the project in 2023 once facilities are built, predators and weeds are removed, and protective fencing is in place. The organisations are partnering with ice-cream brands Connoisseur and NUII to realise the project. The federal government in February uplisted the conservation status of koalas from vulnerable to endangered, as recommended by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. In May, the NSW government also listed koalas as endangered.  Updated at 10.19am BST    9.55am    Victorian energy minister says state has sufficient reserves After a big afternoon Peter Hannam has clocked off but he wanted me to share this last thought with you:  \u201cIf Vivid Sydney goes dark, what do you get? Livid Sydney?\u201d We also have a statement from the Victorian minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio.   Aemo have advised that we continue to have sufficient energy reserves and that the suspension is to protect energy users and put certainty back into the market.  We have been engaging very regularly with Aemo and understood they were considering a range of options, including suspending the National Energy Market. It is disappointing that energy generators were potentially gaming the system and not utilising the options available to them \u2013 this behaviour is unacceptable and will be investigated.  We continue to push for reforms that put the needs of Victorians ahead of big company profits.   Victorian households and businesses continue to be in a better position than those in the other eastern states due to our nation leading investments in renewables. This investment is delivering cheaper energy prices for Victorian households and businesses, while we work towards net zero emissions by 2050.

Updated at 9.46am BST    9.27am    Victorian Greens convener criticised for past comments about trans people The newly elected Victorian Greens convener, Linda Gale, co-authored a 2019 document which has been described as \u201cinconsistent with Greens values\u201d.  Senator Janet Rice says Gale\u2019s position is \u201cuntenable\u201d unless she distances herself from the comments that have been labelled transphobic. Read the story here:   Updated at 9.47am BST    9.16am    Greater gliders get new homes after fires Greater gliders that lost their tree-trunk homes in the black summer bushfires have been given new hi-tech digs with great insulation, top-notch security and killer views, AAP reports. The world\u2019s largest gliding marsupial was already considered vulnerable to extinction before ferocious bushfires wiped out almost a third of its habitat. Experts quickly realised they were facing a housing crisis, with the flames destroying mature, hollow trees the gliders use for shelter. Their minds turned to nesting boxes as a stop-gap measure. But standard models with their thin walls and lack of thermal protection were unsuitable for gliders, which won\u2019t eat if they get too hot. That\u2019s a recipe for death within days because gliders have low fat stores and rely on low-calorie eucalypt leaves for both food and water. \u201cThey are just like us,\u201d Dr Kara Youngentob, from the Australian National University, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like a big meal when we\u2019re hot and neither do they. But their food isn\u2019t full of energy and fat. \u201cThey also get all of their water from their leaves. So when they\u2019re not eating as much they get dehydrated.\u201d  Updated at 9.45am BST    9.00am   Sydney residents asked to reduce power usage  The NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, has called on residents in his state to reduce their power consumption this evening to help the grid cope with a lack of supply. As it stands, the crunch time will come about 8.30pm, according to Aemo\u2019s latest alert for NSW.   If there is an opportunity to reduce their energy usage, like not using their dishwasher until they go to bed, that would help.  A number of coal-fired power stations that were expected to be working tonight have not come online, Kean said. Vivid will still go ahead, he said. Earlier, Kean welcomed the decision to suspend the wholesale power market across the five eastern states and the ACT \u2013 the first time the proverbial plug has been pulled on the whole scheme.  This decision will help prevent energy companies from putting energy reliability at risk by unnecessarily withdrawing supply. I expect power companies to do the right thing by their customers and the country. We will continue to work closely with the federal government and other states as well as the independent market operator to navigate the situation in the Nem.   Updated at 9.20am BST    8.53am         8.43am    Richard Marles to attend Commonwealth meeting in Rwanda The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, confirmed he would be representing Australia at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda next week.  He is also set to visit to India next week to reinforce ties with the country.  Updated at 8.45am BST    8.37am    Anthony Albanese meets Nadesalingam family On Twitter, the PM said he had met with the Nadesalingam family.    Updated at 8.39am BST    8.26am    Richard Marles speaks of greater cooperation between Australia and Japan in the Pacific The defence minister, Richard Marles, has also spoken about the potential for \u201cgreater cooperation between Australia and Japan in the Pacific\u201d. Marles said the issue came up during the meeting with Japan\u2019s defence minister, Nobuo Kishi, in Tokyo today. Marles told reporters:  The Pacific is obviously a part of the world which is deeply critical for Australia, but it\u2019s also a part of the world where Japan has had a long engagement. And I\u2019ve seen that first-hand in the work that I\u2019ve done in Pacific island countries. Japan\u2019s reputation amongst Pacific Island countries for the provision of infrastructure is unsurpassed. They do a wonderful job.  Today, they [Japan] talked about doing more port visits to countries in the Pacific, including Solomon Islands. That\u2019s a really important initiative that we welcome. And earlier this year, Australia and Japan worked together in terms of the provision of assistance to Tonga after the tsunami.   Asked about joint ventures on infrastructure in the Pacific, Marles said partnering with Japan was \u201cfundamentally a good idea\u201d and \u201cthe more we do that, the better\u201d.  When we combine resources, we can do so much more. Japan acknowledges Australia\u2019s proximity to the Pacific, the fact that the Pacific is an area where we seek to lead in the context of other countries\u2019 engagement in the Pacific. We talk in terms of earning the right that we seek to do to be the natural partner of choice of the countries in the Pacific. Japan supports that and welcomes that. But there are things that Japan can do in the Pacific which greatly add to our joint capability and one of those is infrastructure.  Ahead of foreign minister Penny Wong\u2019s visit to Honiara this Friday, Marles said the new Australian government wanted to send a message to Solomon Islands \u201cthat we intend to make the Pacific an absolute focus of our foreign policy\u201d.  We want to revitalise our relationships in the Pacific \u2013 we are going to do the work.     Updated at 8.34am BST    8.19am    Richard Marles asked about meeting with Chinese counterpart The defence minister, Richard Marles, was also asked about his meeting on Sunday with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, in Singapore and whether the trade tensions had been part of that discussion. Marles confirmed that he had raised China\u2019s security agreement with Solomon Islands in Sunday\u2019s meeting. Marles said there were other discussions that he would not disclose publicly, but added:  The meeting with Minister Wei began and more importantly ended with a desire on the part of both of us to try and put the bilateral relationship [between China and Australia] into a better place, not just in terms of the area of defence, but generally.   Marles reiterated that it was \u201conly the first step\u201d and there was \u201ca long way to go\u201d. (The trade minister, Don Farrell, has not been able to secure a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of a World Trade Organization conference in Geneva this week.)  Updated at 8.27am BST    8.11am    Japan and Australia are the very best of friends, deputy PM says in Tokyo Richard Marles has spoken to reporters in Tokyo. The defence minister and deputy prime minister said the relationship with Japan was \u201cfront and centre in terms of our national interests\u201d. He said today\u2019s meeting with his counterpart, Nobuo Kishi, was \u201cof real substance\u201d. He said in the 1980s commerce was at the heart of the Australia-Japan relationship. That element remained, he said, but now the building of the defence and security relationship was \u201cat the heart of the work we are doing together\u201d. Marles said the pair had used today\u2019s meeting to \u201cput the meat on the bones\u201d of a defence deal \u2013 the reciprocal access agreement \u2013 that was reached under the former Morrison government. That agreement sets up a legal framework for their forces to train in each other\u2019s territory:  It allows our defence forces to operate in each other\u2019s countries and I think what we will see is more of that. We take this a step at a time.   Marles said that Japan would, for the first time, send aircraft to participate in the Royal Australian Air Force\u2019s Exercise Pitch Black in August. He said that was \u201cemblematic of the kind of activity that we can both engage in going forward\u201d.  From the perspective of Australia, we obviously see Japan as being really important to our strategic future. But what\u2019s been so gratifying about this visit is that that feeling is reciprocated. It\u2019s very clear that from the perspective of Japan, they see their relationship with us in Australia as being one of the highest order. That presents such an enormous opportunity for us to take the relationship forward and we were very pleased to be able to take steps in doing that today.  This all comes days after Marles met with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, in Singapore on Sunday, ending a diplomatic freeze of more than two years. Marles\u2019 trip to Japan appears to be designed, in part, to assert that Australia is not changing its fundamental foreign policy and defence settings. Marles said:  It is really clear that when times are tough, friends come to the fore. And today, Japan and Australia are the very best of friends.   Updated at 8.19am BST    7.57am    NSW treasurer Matt Kean to speak on electricity market The NSW treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, will address the media at 5.15pm following the decision to suspend the electricity market. We will bring you that when it comes.   Updated at 8.05am BST    7.50am    Union calls for review of \u2018broken\u2019 national electricity market The Electrical Trades Union is calling for an independent review of the entire national electricity market (Nem) following the unprecedented decision by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) to take over national energy supplies. The union\u2019s acting national secretary, Michael Wright, said:  The ETU has been sounding the alarm about the Nem for years. This vindicates our long-held concerns that the market is broken and beyond repair. The experiment in synthetic markets, trying to deliver essential public services through profit-motivated, tax-avoiding multinational energy corporations, has failed shockingly.  Gas and coal companies prioritising the export market is just a symptom of a problem, not the cause. The cause is complete regulatory failure.  Prime minister Anthony Albanese and energy minister Chris Bowen now have a clear mandate to step in and order an urgent review of the entire national electricity market.  Even if Aemo\u2019s unprecedented intervention gets us through this acute phase of the crisis, we cannot return to the status quo. There is a serious question of whether the Nem should ever be allowed to resume.  A national review must consider how to remove the dead wood of rampant financialisation and short-termism that now dominates the Nem, which is placing a huge brake on the energy sector\u2019s capacity to improve productivity and efficiency.   Updated at 8.03am BST    7.39am   AEC confirms South Australia Senate results  The Australian Electoral Commission has confirmed the Senate results in South Australia, with three Liberals, two Labor and one Greens senator elected.  As expected, Simon Birmingham, Andrew McLachlan and Kerrynne Liddle will represent the Liberals, with ministers Penny Wong and Don Farrell for the Labor government, and Barbara Pocock for the Greens. The first five senators on the AEC list were all expected to be elected for some time, but the only possible wildcard was the small possibility of One Nation grabbing the final seat \u2013 but that went to Liddle and the Liberals. It\u2019s also now confirmed that former Senate powerbroker Nick Xenophon has again missed out, after another unsuccessful bid for office. You might remember he quit the Senate in 2017, in a bid to run for the South Australian state parliament, but that didn\u2019t pan out. He announced a late bid to return to the federal Senate shortly before the election, but that too has now been confirmed as unsuccessful. Xenophon congratulated the winners in a video posted to Twitter.   Updated at 7.45am BST    7.34am    Westerman says other states not affected by market suspension Westerman is asked if any other states are facing blackouts \u2013 he says they are mainly worried about New South Wales.  Reporter: \u201cAre there any other states that could be facing blackouts?\u201d  What I\u2019m saying is that in NSW in particular, we are concerned about the supply and demand balance for this evening, potentially tomorrow we would urge consumers in NSW only, to conserve energy where it is safe to do so. We are doing everything we can to make sure we have sufficient generation on tap to meet supply.  He said other factors adding to this include: \u201cThe effect of the international crisis on gas, coal, availability of coal plants.\u201d Reporter: \u201cHow... do we not get into this situation in the future?\u201d  That is a question for policymakers. It is a policy question, what I\u2019m focused on is making sure we have sufficient electricity to meet customer needs.    Updated at 7.38am BST    7.31am    Westerman: market will restart when generators co-operate Westerman says by suspending the market they are creating one simple place where generators can put all their availability and it can be dispatched in a methodical way.  We will restart the market once we are confident the market will co-operate. What we are doing today is suspending the market because we see it is impossible to operate the market under current circumstances, and we will reassess that every day. Once we are confident we can operate it and not see generators withdrawing their availability then we will restart the market.   Updated at 7.33am BST    7.27am    Westerman: electricity prices won\u2019t rise as result of market suspension A reporter has asked if prices will go up because of this \u2013 but Westerman says they won\u2019t.   Under market suspension rules we have worked off a pricing schedule reflective of prices over a trailing period, generators will be receiving compensation based on prices over the past month. We will have to check that. So, it\u2019s not true to say that prices would go up under this market suspension mechanism.   Updated at 7.31am BST    7.25am    Westerman: NSW residents should conserve energy if safe to do so Westerman is asked if Australians can use normal heating tonight \u2013 he said he is asking NSW residents to conserve their energy where it is safe to do so.  Reporter: \u201cIs this the sign that the national electricity market is challenged?\u201d  We are seeing very challenging times, right now we see the market is not able to deal with all the factors thrown at it, frankly those factors are quite extreme, ranging from generators that are both planned and unplanned outages, very high demand, a confluence of factors at hand.   Updated at 7.34am BST    7.23am    Westerman: generators will have clear process to recover costs Reporter: \u201cIs this the best possible option?\u201d Westerman:   We have seen a large amount of generators pull availability from the electricity market facing higher cost, we have faced high demand profiles due to the cold weather, input costs have increased due to the international factors, we have had a few transmission line outages which has resulted in a price rise.  Reporter: \u201cWill generators still be compensated?\u201d Westerman:  By suspending the market we are putting in a simple process to put in their input and have a clear process to recover their cost.   Updated at 7.35am BST    7.20am    Aemo boss: first time national market has been suspended Journalist: \u201cHow long do you envisage the suspension to last for?\u201d Westerman:   We will reinstate the market once we are confident we can operate it, we will reevaluate that on a daily basis.  He is asked how unprecedented this move is:   We suspended the market in Tasmania and South Australia last year so it is a process familiar to market participants. This is the first time it has been done nationally.   Updated at 7.22am BST    7.18am    Market suspension best for consumers, Aemo says Westerman says this will deliver the best outcome for Australian consumers.   The suspension of the market is a temporary measure and will be reviewed daily. We will return the market to its normal state once Aemo is confident that we can operate the market again and not see generators withdraw their availability. Practically, this means we are creating one simple process where generators can put their availability and have a simple, clear process for them to recover their costs. Prior to suspending the market today, Aemo had issued over 5,000 megawatts of directions and that is roughly 20% of demand.  And it is simply not possible to operate the market in this way. These actions today, we are confident will deliver the best outcome for Australian consumers.   Updated at 7.22am BST    7.16am   Aemo press conference on electricity market situation  Daniel Westerman says today, Aemo has suspended the national electricity market.  This decision was made because it was impossible to operate the system under current conditions while ensuring reliable, secure supply of electricity to Australian homes and businesses. By suspending the market, we are creating a simple process where Aemo has true visibility of which generators are available and when in advance, rather than relying on last minute interventions.  That visibility will help us to manage the system in real-time as well as to understand the balance of supply and demand in the period ahead. Despite this, conditions remain tight in the coming days, in particular in New South Wales where we would urge consumers to conserve energy where it is safe to do so.    Updated at 7.19am BST    7.14am    We are going now to Adelaide where the chief executive of the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), Daniel Westerman, is speaking ...  Updated at 7.17am BST    7.08am    Peter Dutton says Chris Bowen has to fix electricity problem ...  No word yet from the political leaders about the big energy story this afternoon. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the energy minister, Chris Bowen, are in Gladstone. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who\u2019s in Perth, has got to the microphone first. \u201cI worry it is going to be tough under Labor,\u201d he says.  Dutton says the Coalition kept electricity prices low \u2013 but that was for about a two-year period, and they left most of the mess facing Albanese, it would seem. \u201cBowen\u2019s aged 20 years\u201d since he\u2019s been in the job, Dutton says. \u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \u201cThis a problem of Chris Bowen\u2019s making, and he\u2019s got to fix it.\u201d  That seems a tad tough on a minister who\u2019s barely had a fortnight in the job, but there you go. As for energy, you can read more of our report here:  Even though the market has been suspended, we\u2019re still getting updated lack of reserve notices, which is slightly confusing. Will they keep sending these, showing the forecast shortfall for New South Wales?   Updated at 7.13am BST    7.02am    We are expecting the press conference from Aemo any time now ...      6.42am    Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister will meet the prime minister of Solomon Islands in Honiara on Friday, attempting to mend ties after the Pacific country signed a security agreement with China.      6.32am    Trade minister wants free trade agreement with EU by end of year The trade minister, Don Farrell, has spoken to Sky News from Geneva, where he has been attending a World Trade Organization conference.  Farrell hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to meet his Chinese counterpart but reiterated that Australia would be happy to meet any time to discuss the removal of trade sanctions against Australian export sectors. Farrell said he would meet the French trade minister later today \u2013 the latest sign of improving ties after the Aukus-fuelled rift under the former government. Farrell said he was hopeful for the early resumption of negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement.  I\u2019d like to think we could get a free trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year.  Narrator voice: Farrell hereby joins the great tradition of politicians setting end-of-year deadlines for trade talks. Farrell adds:  Relationships are being repaired, not just in Asia but right around the world with this new government.

The spokesperson confirmed it was the first time the entire market had been suspended. It was not caused by a single event but rather a build-up over the past few days when an ever-growing number of forecast shortfalls were emerging.The last main interruption was linked to the \u201cSA black\u201d event in 2016, when tornados knocked over key transmission lines and a bunch of windfarms exceeded their settings, and were turned off (but they were NOT the main problem). Suspending the market does not mean we\u2019re about to get blackouts. \u201cHopefully, this [suspension] will bring more stability to operations,\u201d the Aemo spokesperson said. The planned meeting of regulators with generators did NOT go ahead as planned, the Australian Energy Regulator has just let know.  Aemo\u2019s market suspension rendered such a meeting redundant, it seems.

Updated at 5.59am BST    5.41am    NSW disaster agencies defend flood response New South Wales disaster management agencies have defended their rescue and recovery response to the record-breaking floods which claimed 13 lives earlier this year, AAP reports. The NSW resilience commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, the State Emergency Service boss, Carlene York, and the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Rob Rogers, appeared on the final day of hearings before an upper house committee on Wednesday. The inquiry is examining the authorities\u2019 ability to save lives and property during the catastrophic floods and is separate to the government\u2019s own investigation. The committee chairman, Labor MP Walt Secord, said communities in the state\u2019s north were angry that Resilience NSW had treated the \u201cfourth worst natural disaster\u201d in modern Australian history as a \u201cnine-to-five job\u201d. But Fitzsimmons vigorously defended the agency\u2019s conduct in reaching and supporting flood evacuees.  We\u2019re not a 24-hour organisation. We don\u2019t have thousands of personnel. We\u2019re active and engaged but we\u2019re only a couple of hundred people. We don\u2019t have the scale or resourcing during the response phase of these events.  York said 13 lives were lost from late February until early April across the state, with the town of Lismore in the Northern Rivers region hit the hardest. The SES was dispatched to more than 2,200 flood rescues and responded to in excess of 33,400 requests for help.   Updated at 5.47am BST    5.31am    Minimum wage increase \u2018pitiful\u2019, Antipoverty Centre says The Antipoverty Centre has released a statement in relation to the wage increase \u2013 saying the daily pay rise would not even cover the cost of iceberg lettuce.  Jay Coonan, an Antipoverty Centre spokesperson, said:  The Antipoverty Centre is relieved that some low paid workers will soon get a pay rise, many of whom do not earn enough to get above the poverty line. But $1 an hour is a pitiful increase that maintains the status quo and does not meaningfully improve lives \u2013 it won\u2019t even buy an iceberg lettuce for a day\u2019s work.  We are disturbed by the decision to delay the increase for workers in aviation, tourism and hospitality. There is no justification for prioritising businesses over the wellbeing of the workers they rely on.  Announcing the wages decision the Fair Work Commission president said \u2018low paid workers are particularly vulnerable\u2019 \u2013 so what does that make the five million people who rely on poverty-level Centrelink payments? Our payments are becoming worth less with each day, and so far we\u2019ve heard nothing but repeated commitments from the new government to keep it that way.    Updated at 5.40am BST    5.19am   Aemo suspends spot market for electricity  After all those notices about shortfalls in the wholesale spot electricity market serving eastern Australia, it looks like the Australian Energy Market Operator has blown a whistle, and the game is suspended ...  More on this soon.  Updated at 5.31am BST    5.09am    Energy generators meet to discuss electricity market Eastern Australia\u2019s generators are sitting down with the members of the Energy Security Board to chat about how the electricity market is going. They will no doubt be discussing why generators are withdrawing capacity and then being asked to supply it by the regulators. And presumably they will discuss how to avoid worrying the public about possible electricity supply shortfalls. Take New South Wales, for instance, where the projected \u201clack of reserve level 3\u201d (LOR 3) implies a lot of gaps need filling, particularly one at 8pm tomorrow evening with 4,000 megawatts needed. (At present, NSW as a whole is using about 6,100MW.)  It can be hard to keep up, since Victoria also has a bunch of LOR 3s, including tomorrow at 6.30pm when 2,000MW of supply needs to be found. These gaps are being closed, but sometimes the regulator has to intervene and tell a lucky generator it\u2019s time to switch on, as happened earlier today in Victoria.  Queensland and South Australia have also been in the mix today as far as projected shortfalls. The SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, this morning told RN Breakfast the market was an \u201cembarrassment\u201d.  Given we might have a few weeks or longer to go before the supply risks subside, we might want to consider how the messaging can be tweaked. Otherwise we might not be ready when a real crisis looms ...    Updated at 5.16am BST    4.58am    Encrypted apps must be regulated to curb far-right extremism, inquiry told From AAP:  The federal government needs to take action against encrypted messaging apps like Telegram to curb the rise of far-right extremism, a Victorian inquiry has been told.  Far-right extremists initially shared hateful content on mainstream sites like Facebook and Twitter but are increasingly being deplatformed, Swinburne University\u2019s Dr Belinda Barnet told Wednesday\u2019s hearing.  The groups are now moving to spaces like Telegram where they can share their ideas without censure or detection from the authorities, which is dangerous, Barnet said. These apps are also allowing the far right to draw in people from the \u201cfringes of society\u201d, Swinburne University\u2019s Associate Prof Christine Agius told the parliamentary inquiry.  They often share grievances around perceived entitlement \u2013 that society has changed too much, feminism has gone too far, and minority groups are taking what\u2019s rightfully theirs.  Updated at 5.05am BST    4.45am    Erickson: \u2018There\u2019s a lot to reflect on\u2019 about the media during the campaign Jumping back to the National Press Club, Erickson was asked about the media:      Updated at 4.58am BST    4.36am    Joel Fitzgibbon appointed to forest industry board From AAP:  Former Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon says the forest industry has a strong role to play in climate mitigation and jobs provision. The former minister and MP for the New South Wales seat of Hunter has been appointed to the Australian Forest Products Association board as an independent non-executive director. \u201cAs the former minister and shadow minister for forestry, I have met many of AFPA\u2019s members and have seen firsthand the countless benefits the industry provides to Australia\u2019s economy and the livelihoods of Australians,\u201d he said in a statement on Wednesday.  \u201c[The] industry is passionate about the role it can play in climate mitigation, building our regional communities by providing meaningful and secure jobs and delivering the millions of fibre-based products we often take for granted \u2013 from timber for houses, to paper and tissue products. \u201cI look forward to working with my board colleagues and AFPA management as we look to the future of forest industries.\u201d The AFPA chair, Greg McCormack, said Fitzgibbon would bring to the board passionate support for forest industries. \u201c[And he] understands intimately how we can assist the new Albanese government deliver both greater climate change initiatives and more timber for our builders and renovators,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cJoel\u2019s vast experience in both strategic vision and policy development will provide valuable input for the AFPA board and in dealings with all levels of the government and the public service as we all try to deliver on the more than $300m in new initiatives Labor committed to during the election, along with key policy changes.\u201d  Updated at 4.50am BST    4.26am    Labor not concerned about rise of independents and Greens, Erickson suggests Paul Karp: \u201cI note the seats that you had climate swings to you \u2013 Bennelong, Chisholm, Higgins and Boothby. Only one of them had a high-profile independent and none of them were top-tier Greens targets. So my question is: how worried are you that those will be the next to fall to a growing crossbench if Labor doesn\u2019t lift its ambition on climate?\u201d Erickson:   I\u2019m confident of the four members that were elected in those seats that they\u2019ll do an excellent job over the next three years. I think if we look at the teal seats, the issues that were in play in those seats were the electorate\u2019s dissatisfaction with Mr Morrison\u2019s performance as prime minister, and anger at the Liberal party over climate, over the treatment of women and over integrity. The 2022 election and the contest between the Liberals and the teals played out with those issues and on the terms that we saw. So I don\u2019t think that you can extrapolate from that much, if anything, about what the next election might look like and what it means for the Labor government.  Erickson: Greens \u2018seek to divide Labor\u2019s base in a manner that doesn\u2019t help progressive politics\u2019 On the Greens, Erickson says:   I think there\u2019s in doubt that the Greens are an effective campaign machine and they do have a very successful strategy that they have honed over 20 years, which is to always position yourself two steps to the left of Labor, minimise our successes, give zero credit for any of the progressive gains that Labor governments make, constantly criticise and seek to divide Labor\u2019s base in a manner that doesn\u2019t help progressive politics.  That\u2019s what Adam\u2019s entire adult life has been about.    Updated at 4.37am BST    4.20am    Erickson: \u2018The test is not whether you can run a mistake-free campaign. The test is how do you respond when new challenges emerge\u2019 David Crowe from SMH and The Age: \u201cWhat are your reflections on the mistakes, if any, in that campaign?\u201d Erickson:   No campaign is perfect. The experience of every campaign is the challenges are constantly thrown at you and things go wrong. The test is not whether you can run a mistake-free campaign. The test is how do you respond when new challenges emerge, when events throw unexpected dynamics at you, or when mistakes happen.  It was even more so the case in this campaign because of Covid. We were constantly having people get sick. I missed a week, the leader missed a week, the president, the assistant national secretary, I think around half of the cabinet.  So it was just constantly coming at us. And so the way I think to deal with that is as a campaigner is just to maintain that focus on what is your strategy, what are you trying to do? And that\u2019s how we dealt with and grappled with challenges as they came along.   Updated at 4.29am BST    4.16am    Labor can continue to build support and lift primary vote, Erickson says Greg Brown from The Australian asks if the days of 40% primary votes are over. Erickson:   No, no, I think there are lots of examples around the world and through Australia\u2019s history of a government like this one coming into office in circumstances like this and then building its support and building its support through good government and by delivering on what it promised.  I think we have seen, you know, the Ardern government in New Zealand is a good example in terms of looking at their result in 2017, and then their re-election, there have been examples at a state level here in Australia in the recent history of state Labor governments. And that\u2019s the challenge that\u2019s in front of us.     Updated at 4.39am BST    4.14am    \u2018We did win in our right\u2019: Labor national secretary Phil Coorey from the AFR: \u201cWhat is it in your view that Labor needs to do over the next three years to get that primary vote up and to win it in your own right without the factors that helped you last time?\u201d Erickson:   We did win in our own right. And don\u2019t agree with the proposition that my speech or my remarks have made an argument that we didn\u2019t win it and they lost it.  I think in my remarks I set out how we thought about the election and that we felt that we had two arguments we had to make. First, how would Australia be different under a Labor government led by Anthony Albanese? And we set that case out.  We set it out in principle in terms of Anthony\u2019s leadership style and we set it out in detail on issues like climate, childcare, health and wages and the cost of living.   Updated at 4.23am BST    4.11am    Erickson denies misleading voters on cashless debit card Labor national secretary Paul Erickson is now taking questions at the National Press Club.  Anna Henderson from SBS: \u201cLabor was accused during the election campaign of misleading voters in relation to the cashless debit card and paid advertising suggests it was going to be expanded to all age pensioners. On reflection, was that a lie?\u201d Erickson:   Absolutely it was not a lie. We campaigned against the cashless debit card and pointed to the Liberal government and Anne Ruston the former minister\u2019s own words and we have now taken steps as we committed to abolish the cashless debit card.    Updated at 4.21am BST    4.06am    And with that, I will hand the blog over to the wonderful Cait Kelly for the rest of the day. Thanks for reading.   Updated at 4.16am BST    4.02am         4.00am   Labor campaign director's eight reasons why the Coalition lost the election  Paul Erickson has summarised why the Coalition lost in eight key points:    One, a pathological refusal to take responsibility for anything which comes from their small government mindset.  Two, incompetent management of the Federal Government\u2019s responsibilities during the pandemic.  Three, cabinet-wide partisan attacks on state and territory governments throughout Covid which particularly alienated voters in Victoria and Western Australia.  Four, incompetent budget management.  Five, an incompetent and incoherent response to the cost of living crisis.  Six, incoherent engagement with our allies in our region.  Seven, a lack of awareness or interest in women\u2019s experiences across the economy and society. Eight, a decades long failure to take climate change seriously.  Scott Morrison may have come to personify these failures but they are institutional and collective, not individual. They\u2019re actively prosecuted by senior cabinet ministers and all Coalition leaders, including the two men then seen as the only likely successors to Scott Morrison \u2013 Josh Frydenberg and Peter Dutton.    Updated at 4.16am BST    3.55am    Paul Erickson says Coalition\u2019s \u2018all out assault\u2019 on states amid Covid was \u2018galling\u2019  Paul Erickson makes particular point of discussing the gendered approach the Morrison government often took to particular issues, including the response to Covid.  Erickson first pointed out the Coalition\u2019s \u201cgalling\u201d choice to engaging in an \u201call out assault\u201d on state and territory Labor governments:   It was odd and then galling to watch the Liberals commence an all out assault on state and territory Labor governments in the second half of 2020 over the Covid response.  This began with the passive cynicism of Morrison reducing his daily media appearances as second wave outbreaks in New South Wales and Victoria took off, leaving it to the premiers to front the bad news. It started at the top, but this strategy was pursued with enthusiasm by the entire Coalition led not just by Morrison but by the whole of the cabinet.  This was followed by Morrison\u2019s recklessly partisan [criticism] of the Andrew\u2019s government roadmap back to normal, which the media establishment outside of Melbourne misunderstood in my judgement. Morrison\u2019s cynical criticism of the Palaszczuk\u2019s government border closure in the lead-up of the state election was beneath any prime minister. And of course the Liberals backed Clive Palmer\u2019s failed high court challenge to the WA border closure.  Morrison showed he had a \u2018failure to understand women\u2019, Erikson says Erickson then points out two interesting points: the first, that the Morrison government put forward its network of cabinet ministers and advisors \u201cshaping government policy\u201d, and 13 of the 14 were men. Next, Erickson points out the Morrison government ended free childcare, as well as going back over his response to Australia reckoning with \u201cworkplace culture and bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault in parliamentary and political workplaces\u201d.   Women suffered the most during the pandemic, yet the Liberal response demonstrated either a lack of awareness or a lack of interest. Scott Morrison\u2019s strange inability to comprehend life outside his own experiences had already been on display. . I\u2019m not here to offer any partisan conclusions about the culture of Parliament House, but in the context of this year\u2019s federal election I would make this observation: two of Scott Morrison\u2019s comments from that period continued to come up in our research right up until the election day as indicative of his failure to understand women.  First, that it wasn\u2019t until he considered these issues as a husband and a father that he was able to reflect and listen.  And secondly, that women who marched outside Parliament House were lucky not to be met with bullets.   Updated at 4.14am BST    3.44am    Labor national secretary says voters rejected Coalition and \u2018more of the same\u2019  Labor\u2019s national secretary and election campaign director, Paul Erickson, is addressing the National Press Club now, discussing the context behind Labor\u2019s victory at the federal election.  Erickson credits Anthony Albanese\u2019s offering of a \u201cbetter future\u201d as opposed to three more years of Scott Morrison as the \u201cpowerful argument\u201d that secured the party victory.    Labor won the election because we talked about the future and we offered the country an alternative to more of the same. After two years of Covid ... and nearly a decade of Coalition neglect, Labor offered Australians the chance to elect a prime minister who would show up, who would take responsibility and would work with people to solve problems \u2013 an opportunity that Australians took.  The biggest barrier Labor had to overcome was not voters\u2019 evaluation of our proposition or a counter offer from the Coalition. It was a widespread and deep sense of fatigue, anxiety and aversion to risk after some of the most difficult years that we have endured.  Normally these sentiments would drive fence sitters decisively back to the government of the day and weigh heavily against an effort to build a majority for change.  Yet we had a powerful argument \u2013 we assert that the alternatives of this election were not the devil you know or a leap into the unknown, instead it was a clear choice between a better future under Anthony Albanese or three more years of a Morrison government.  In the 18 months leading up to polling day, the Coalition refused to talk about the future and refused to put forward anything resembling a positive case for their own re-election.   Updated at 4.35am BST    3.37am           3.33am    Victorian government confident it has enough power supply Senior Victorian minister Jacinta Allan told reporters earlier today the state was not in danger of any blackouts, saying it has sufficient energy supply and that it has no plans to change its position on the permanent ban on coal seam gas exploration.   There is undoubtedly pressure on our energy supply but the advice from Aemo is that Victoria has adequate power supply.    Updated at 3.40am BST    3.26am   Tony Burke says era of wages being kept \u2018deliberately low\u2019 is over  Bowen is followed by the minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, who takes credit for the increase to the minimum wage, and blasts the former government for not pushing for an increase earlier:   The era of wages being kept deliberately low by the Liberal and National parties effectively came to an end today. It came to an end for people on the minimum wage. It came to an end for cleaners, for shop assistants, for people in the care economy. A wage increase that the Liberal and National Party never would have advocated for. People will be seeing in their bank accounts what the change of government means. People will be seeing in their bank accounts a wage increase that never would have happened back when we had a government committed and determined to keep wages deliberately low. For the first time in nearly a decade, we\u2019ve had a government argue for a real wage increase and now it\u2019ll be delivered.    Updated at 3.34am BST    3.24am    Chris Bowen says energy system \u2018under pressure\u2019 Next up is the energy minister, Chris Bowen, who says he is so far pleased that the country has avoided blackouts, but says the system is under \u201cpressure\u201d and that the government supports Aemo to manage the situation:    I\u2019m very pleased that we have been able to avoid so far any significant load shedding events or of course blackouts. I am also pleased that Aemo advises me that that will likely continue to be the case, that we will be able to avoid any load shedding events or any blackouts. Of course that is subjected to any unexpected outages in the system.  As I\u2019ve said repeatedly this week, the system is under pressure. We have administered pricing (controls) in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria and that is leading to market outcomes which are requiring Aemo to intervene very heavily into the market.  And yesterday, Aemo directed more than 5,000 megawatts into the market using their powers. They directed generators to bid into the market and to generate more than 5,000 megawatts across the national energy market.  As I said, Aemo advises that the situation continues to remain that load shedding and blackouts are unlikely, but continues under very active management.  I\u2019ve made clear to Aemo that the government supports any action they choose to take to effectively manage the situation in the best interests of Australian consumers, whether they be big industrial consumers or residential consumers.    Updated at 3.38am BST    3.23am   Albanese 'absolutely' welcomes increase to minimum wage  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has welcomed the Fair Work Commission\u2019s increase to the minimum wage, and referenced a key moment from the election campaign:    At the heart of the election campaign, I was asked whether I would welcome a decision by the Fair Work Commission to increase the minimum wage by just $1. And today, they have done just that. And when I was asked, Would I welcome a decision? I said, Absolutely.  And I absolutely welcome today\u2019s decision of a 5.2% increase granted by the Fair Work Commission to all those who are on the minimum wage. That lifts the minimum wage up by just $1.05 an hour or $40 a week. It makes a difference to people who are struggling with the cost of living.  The Fair Work Commission, having assessed the impact on the economy, having made an assessment based upon all the submissions, has chosen 5.2% \u2013 which is why we didn\u2019t put a precise figure on it. We just said we didn\u2019t want people to go backwards, and I welcome that. The truth is that many of those people who are on the minimum wage are the heroes who saw us through the pandemic. These workers deserve more than our thanks, they deserve a pay rise and today they\u2019ve got it.   Updated at 3.29am BST    3.19am    The prime minister Anthony Albanese has just stepped up for a press conference.   Updated at 3.24am BST    3.14am    Aemo warns of power shortfalls in South Australia The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued a warning for South Australia, where power shortfalls are being anticipated in a few days time.  In a statement, the Aemo says people in South Australia could see interruptions to their power on Friday morning and evening.  From 8am to 9.30am on Friday, the maximum load forecast to be interrupted is 359 megawatts, while from 5pm to 9.30pm that evening the maximum load forecast to be interrupted is 382 megawatts.   Aemo has not yet estimated the latest time it would need to intervene through an Aemo intervention event. Aemo is seeking a market response.   Updated at 3.22am BST    3.08am         3.05am   Blackstone\u2019s takeover of Crown Resorts approved by federal court  The federal court has approved US private equity group Blackstone\u2019s takeover of Crown Resorts, paving the way for the troubled casino group to de-list from the stock exchange. Justice Stewart Anderson gave the takeover scheme approval after a brief hearing this morning. It\u2019s not quite right to say he rubber-stamped the deal \u2013 these days, the court\u2019s seal is applied digitally. The pathway to the courthouse was cleared over the past week when state-based gambling regulators approved Blackstone as a fit and proper operator of the casinos they oversee. Blackstone is now able to pay shareholders, including James Packer, for their stakes in the company and take full control. You can expect it to be de-listed from the ASX quite quickly. The takeover comes after a torrid period for Crown, with multiple inquiries into allegations of money laundering and links between the junket operators who brought in high-rolling gamblers and organised crime, sparked by a 2019 expose in Nine Entertainment\u2019s newspapers and on its flagship current affairs show, 60 Minutes. Crown facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos and junket operators were indeed linked to organised crime, the first of the inquiries, in NSW, found.

The retail giant has decided to freeze the prices of flour, sugar, canned tomatoes, frozen peas, chicken tenders, laundry powder and dishwashing liquid. In an email that will be circulated among customers on Thursday, Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said:  We know this is a significant portion of weekly household budgets. As we all lean into the challenges of inflation, rest assured the whole team at Woolworths is committed to making sure you can always Get your Woolies worth.    Updated at 3.14am BST    2.48am   AEC declines recount in seat of Gilmore  The Australian Electoral Commission says it will not conduct a recount in the federal seat of Gilmore, after Liberal candidate Andrew Constance requested one yesterday. \u201cI can confirm that a recount will not be directed. The request was considered carefully,\u201d an AEC spokesperson said.  The counting process was undertaken in line with the Electoral Act and there was sufficient checking and re-checking of ballot papers during the scrutiny period (including the fresh scrutiny process).  The declaration of the poll for Gilmore is being reset with a time and location to be updated on the AEC\u2019s website shortly.   Constance said his scrutineers in the ultra-marginal seat had \u201craised concerns in relation to certain aspects of the process, particularly the scrutiny of informal votes\u201d, claiming there were \u201cstrong grounds for a recount\u201d considering the close result. Constance came up just short, recording a 2.44% swing but ending up behind Labor on a two-party margin of 50.17\u201349.83, according to the AEC\u2019s official results.  The Labor MP Fiona Phillips was due to be declared the winner in Gilmore on the NSW south coast at 2pm on Tuesday, but the declaration was delayed due to the request.The AEC said on Wednesday it would officially declare the result in Gilmore at a date soon to be confirmed. Phillips welcomed the news in a tweet, saying \u201cAndrew Constance\u2019s application for a recount in Gilmore has been denied\u201d. We\u2019ve reached out to Constance for comment.

It was announced yesterday that Wong would be heading to New Zealand for meetings with her counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, tomorrow. And Wong has just announced that she will then head to Solomon Islands on Friday:  On Friday, I will visit Solomon Islands, where I will meet Prime Minister the Hon Manasseh Sogavare and a number of his Cabinet ministers. I also look forward to engaging with the local community, including women leaders. We are committed to deepening our cooperation with Solomon Islands, as we work together to face shared challenges and achieve our shared goals, including on climate change. I look forward to discussing the ways we can continue to make progress on pandemic recovery, economic development and labour mobility priorities, and addressing our shared security interests.  This will be Wong\u2019s third trip to the Pacific since being sworn in last month. Wong also said her statement that New Zealand was \u201can indispensable partner in our ambitions for a stronger Pacific family\u201d.  Wong said she and Mahuta would \u201cconsider ways we can work together, to make the most of the new energy and resources the Australian Government is bringing to the Pacific\u201d. Wong said there were \u201cnew possibilities for collaboration with New Zealand in support of regional security and on climate change\u201d and she looked forward to \u201cdrawing on New Zealand\u2019s experiences as Australia develops a First Nations foreign policy\u201d   Updated at 3.09am BST    2.38am    Aged care sector welcomes wage rise but urges federal government to lift funding The aged care sector has welcomed today\u2019s minimum wage increase, but has warned it needs a funding increase from the federal government to help struggling providers remain viable. Industry peak body Aged &amp; Community Care Providers Association said it was clear that aged care workers needed a \u201csignificant\u201d pay increase.  But the association\u2019s interim chief executive Paul Sadler said that without additional government support, aged care providers would continue to face an impossible choice between investing in quality and finding savings to keep the doors open.  A significant wage increase for our workforce is essential to attract new people and improve quality of care to older Australians, but when two-thirds of providers are already running at a loss year-on-year, we need the wage increase to be funded by the federal government.   Separate from this morning\u2019s case, the Fair Work Commission is also exploring aged care pay through its aged care work value case, which Labor promised to fully fund if it won government. But that aged care work value case is unlikely to conclude until early next year.  In its findings, the aged care royal commission said the government\u2019s current funding indexation process was inadequate, and had failed to keep up with the increased costs faced by providers.  The royal commission recommended that short-term indexation changes be made to improve funding levels in the next few years, until a new independent pricing process, designed to advise government on the cost of aged care services, can begin its work.  That recommendation was not accepted by the previous government. Sadler said:  If we don\u2019t see urgent action the aged care workforce crisis is simply going to translate into other serious problems like increased closures, or offsets in other areas such as training or investment in facilities.   Updated at 2.52am BST    2.29am    Ai Group says wage rise will \u2018add fuel to the inflation fire\u2019 Reactions to the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision continue to pour in, with the head of the national industry association Ai Group saying the increase will \u201cadd fuel to the inflation fire\u201d. Innes Willox, chief executive of Ai Group, said the minimum wage increase could increase inflation and lead to even higher interest rates:   There is a major risk that the 5.2% per cent increase that has been awarded to the National Minimum Wage, with increases of between 4.6% and 5.2% to award rates, will fuel inflation and lead to even higher interest rates; even more hardship for people with mortgages, personal loans or credit card debts; and add substantially to the risk of unemployment and underemployment - particularly for unskilled employees.  The cost increase will be difficult to absorb for businesses that are already struggling to cope with big increases in material and energy costs, interest rate rises, supply chain disruptions and labour shortages.   Updated at 2.35am BST    2.14am   Minimum wage rise a 'risk to the economy', chamber of commerce head says  The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Andrew McKellar, has responded to the minimum wage decision, warning it is a \u201crisk to the economy\u201d and would add $7.9bn to employers\u2019 costs. But even more interesting than the usual complaints about costs was McKellar\u2019s proposal to excise 2.5 million award-reliant workers from the annual wage review, leaving it for the 180,000 lowest paid workers on the national minimum wage. McKellar told reporters in Canberra:  What this highlights is that frankly this national wage case process, the way it feeds into the modern awards, it\u2019s an antiquated process, it\u2019s a process that\u2019s had its day, it\u2019s not compatible with the internationally competitive economy that needs to operate in a flexible way and responding to the circumstances, the competitive challenges and need to drive productivity.  Asked what the alternative is, he said:  You must have [centralised wage fixing] for minimum wages, fine, for the 180,000 people on the lowest wage safety net. But when it flows through to the modern award system it needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. We need to get back to much more effective enterprising bargaining, flexible wage setting driven by the market.  This proposal is interesting. It either means that the Fair Work Commission should run separate reviews of minimums in awards on a case-by-base basis, or, that if you\u2019re on an award and want a pay rise you should turn to enterprise bargaining with your employer. McKellar didn\u2019t clarify the comments after the press conference, but reiterated that the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach of one wage case deciding the pay of 2.6 million workers \u201cisn\u2019t flexible\u201d and alternatives should be on the agenda at the Albanese government\u2019s employment summit.   Updated at 2.21am BST    2.08am    Consumer sentiment plunges towards historic low, Westpac survey says As today\u2019s 5.2% minimum wage increase decision by the Fair Work Commission ripples through the economy, Westpac and the Melbourne Institute have released their latest consumer sentiment survey that points to ongoing falls.  Bill Evans, Westpac\u2019s chief economist, said the 4.5% drop in the index to 86.4 took the gauge towards historic low. It followed the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision last week to hike the cash rate by 50 basis points to 0.85%. \u201cThis read is even weaker than we had expected,\u201d Evans said.  \u201cOver the 46-year history of the survey, we have only seen Index reads at or below this level during major economic dislocations.  \u201cThe record lows have been during COVID-19 (75.6); the Global Financial Crisis (79.0); early 1990s recession (64.6); the mid-1980s slowdown (78.7) and the early 1980s recession (75.5),\u201d he said.  \u201cThose last three episodes were associated with high inflation; rising interest rates; and a contracting economy \u2013 a mix that may be threatening to repeat.\u201d Also worrying is the drop in homebuyer interest, which is close to the lowest in more than a decade, during the GFC.  If sentiment is dimming now, though, imagine what it will look like if investors are right about the near-term future track for the RBA\u2019s cash rate.  If the 1.5% rate by 5 July is right, the 65 basis point increase would be the most by the RBA since 1994.  Updated at 2.14am BST    2.00am         1.54am    National wage case process \u2018antiquated\u2019, chamber of commerce head says McKellar has gone on to call the national wage case process \u201cantiquated\u201d when asked if he is concerned about future pay rises:    It certainly adds to that pressure at a time when labour is intensely difficult to access. We are seeing record levels of vacancies out there in the work place at the moment. One of the things that this decision highlights, and the commission has tried to really nuance, it is a very complicated decision and there is a number of different elements to it.  What this highlights is that, frankly, this national wage case process, the way it feeds into the modern awards, it is an antiquated process. It is a process that\u2019s had its day, it is not compatible with the needs of a modern internationally competitive economy that needs to be operating in a flexible way and responding to the circumstances.   Updated at 2.00am BST    1.51am    Chamber of commerce boss says wages should be flexible and \u2018driven by the market\u2019 So, what does chamber of commerce boss McKellar propose as an alternative?    For minimum wages, fine, that is the 180,000 people on the lowest wages, the wage safety net. When it flows through into the modern award system, this needs to be looked at on a case by case basis. We need to get back to much more effective enterprise bargaining, flexible wage settings, driven by the market.   Updated at 1.59am BST    1.48am   Key event  Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry laments minimum wage increase Now we are jumping into a press conference with the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, who says the increase to minimum wage is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to economy:   It veers very much towards the upper end of the range of possible outcomes that we could have expected to have seen today. In particular, this adds very significant costs to the Australian economy and to business.  By our calculation, this will add $7.9bn in costs to the affected businesses over the year ahead, so that will be a very considerable burden that those businesses will either have to take to the bottom line, or pass onto their customers.  It comes at a time when inflation is emerging as one of the most urgent challenges facing the Australian economy and if we are to address that, if we are to remain competitive, then, clearly, this is not a decision that will help in those circumstances.   Updated at 2.16am BST    1.46am    \u2018People will actually be able to buy the food they need for their families\u2019: McManus McManus is next asked what difference the wage increase will have for households on minimum wage:    For a household on minimum wages, we are talking about an extra $40 a week. That is going to make a significant difference. If you consider the basics.  If you are are on the minimum, all of your wage is spent on the basics. Your grocery bills, your rent, that is your transport costs and your energy costs.  That amount per week is going to mean that people will actually be able to buy the food they need for their families as opposed to having to cut back on that.    Updated at 1.56am BST    1.45am    McManus: \u2018We have always been very mindful of not adding to inflation\u2019 McManus is asked whether the increase will stand the test of time, especially with inflation set to reach 7%. Will another wage crisis hit again?  We were always concerned about what future inflation would be and this moved around the whole time of this annual wage review. It was only yesterday that the reserve bank governor said he thinks inflation will get to around 7% around Christmas.  That is halfway through the pay increase. We were mindful of that problem which is why we were asking for a 5.5% increase and we thought that was reasonable. We don\u2019t know what is going to happen into the future, in terms of inflation, whether or not it is a spike that will quickly come off or whether or not it is going to be something that continues longer than a year.  If it continues longer than a year, obviously, we will need to make sure workers do get pay rises that mean they keep their heads above water. We have always been very mindful of not adding to inflation, that is why we have never asked for a pay increase that is more than inflation and productivity.    Updated at 1.51am BST    1.37am   ACTU secretary Sally McManus welcomes minimum wage increase   We think it is going to make a significant difference to the pressures that low-paid workers are under with cost of living rising.  The union movement fought so hard for this increase across pretty heavy cross winds. We also had to oppose what the employers were arguing for which was very significant real wage cuts at a time when their profits are up 20% and productivity is up as well as unemployment being low.  This decision is one that is reasonable and it is fair. It means that for low-paid workers like Jordan who is with me, he will have a better ability to pay rent and pay for the groceries and to pay for energy bills as well. The union movement is happy and proud that we have fought for this increase and that it is going to make a big difference for so many workers.   Updated at 2.22am BST    1.31am         1.28am    Fair Work boss says rise will not have significant negative impact on economy Ross continued, saying the approach of the commission was one balanced between the needs to address the difficulties faced by people on low wages, with the needs of the economy:   We accept that the approach we have adopted will result in, albeit minor, compression in relativities.  But that consideration is to be balanced against the need to provide greater relief to low-paid workers in the context of rising cost of living pressures. Given the current strength of the labour market, the adjustments we propose to make will not have a significant adverse effect on the performance and competitiveness of the national economy.   Updated at 1.45am BST    1.22am    Some award employees will still have a real wage cut despite rise, Ross says Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross:  In our view, awarding an increase in modern award minimum wages of the magnitude proposed by ACCER, some 6.5%, and the ACTU - 5.5%, would, in the present economic circumstances, pose a real risk of significant adverse effects to the national economy. We acknowledge that the increases we have determined will mean a real wage cut for some award reliant employees. This is an issue that can be addressed in subsequent reviews.   Updated at 1.36am BST    1.16am    Minimum wage rise delayed until October for aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross has revealed the increase in the minimum wage will be delayed to 1 October in the aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors. Ross said:  Absent exceptional circumstances, the Act provides the variations to a national minimum wage order and to modern award minimum wages are to operate from 1 July in the financial year following the review we are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist, such as the warranty or delayed operative date for certain modern awards. These awards are in the aviation tourism and hospitality sector. The variation determinations in respect of [those] modern awards ... will come into operation on 1 October 2022. In respect of the remaining modern awards, We have not been persuaded that there are exceptional circumstances, such as to warrant a delayed operative date in the variation determinations arising from this review.    Updated at 1.45am BST    1.13am   Fair Work Commission rules on 5.2% increase to minimum wage  The Fair Work Commission has ordered the national minimum wage to increase by 5.2%, lifting the national minimum wage from $20.33 to $21.38 an hour. That is a $40 per week increase. Modern award minimum rates will go up 4.6% \u201csubject to a minimum increase of $40 per week\u201d. Justice Iain Ross:  In effect, modern award minimum wage rates above $869.60 per week will receive a 4.6% adjustments wage rates below that level will be adjusted by $40 per week.  The decision sets the pay of at least 2.7m workers on the national minimum or award minimum wages. Ross said the \u201cmost significant changes\u201d since last year\u2019s decision was \u201ca sharp increase in the cost of living and the strengthening of the labour market\u201d. He noted the low-paid are \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to high inflation, which \u201cerodes the real value of workers wages\u201d. Ross said:  At the aggregate level, labor market performance has been particularly strong. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9% compared to 5.5% in April 2021. At the time of the last review, measures of underemployment have also fallen. The improvement in the labor market is forecast to continue in the period ahead. There has also been a sharp rise in the cost of living since last year\u2019s review at the time of last year\u2019s decision, the consumer price index and the underlying measure of inflation. Both stood at 1.1%. The comparable figures now standard 5.1% for the CPI and 3.7% for the trimmed mean or the underlying inflation rate. There is also a marked difference in the inflation forecasts.  Ross said these figures weigh in favour of a higher increase, because employers\u2019 groups\u2019 calls for a moderate increase of about 2.5% would result in real pay cuts.  Updated at 1.16am BST    1.11am      Updated at 1.15am BST    1.10am    Fair Work Commission handing down decision on minimum wage The president of the Fair Work Commission Iain Ross has been speaking now, laying out the context behind the decision he will (soon) announce:    The key differences in economic indicators between last year and this year are set out in table four in our decision. The most significant changes since last year\u2019s review decision have been the sharp increase in the cost of living and the strengthening of the labour market. At the aggregate level, labour market performance has been particularly strong. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9%. Compared to 5.5% in April 2021, at the time of the last review. The improvement in the labour market is forecast to continue in the period ahead. There has also been a sharp rise in the cost of living since last year\u2019s review. At the time of last year\u2019s decision, the consumer price index and the underlying measure of inflation both stood at 1.1%. The comparable figures now stand at 5.1% for the CPI and 3.7% for the trimmed mean, or the underlying inflation rate. There is also a marked difference in the inflation forecasts.    Updated at 1.17am BST    1.08am   Generators under pressure  The Australian Energy Market Operator has taken a little time this morning to update its forecast electricity shortfalls. The aim is to highlight the gap and then nudge the generators to fill it. Here\u2019s the one for Queensland, a so-called level 3 \u201clack of reserve\u201d notice.  NSW is forecast \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 to have a bigger gap, also in the evening:  There are a bunch of other LoR\u2019s, although they are at level 1 and 2. These include Victoria and South Australia, so we\u2019ll be keeping a beady eye on those too.  Updated at 2.07am BST    12.56am   Brisbane council to increase rates on short-stay rental properties  Brisbane property owners who list their homes as short-term accommodation will face a 50% increase in rates amid the state\u2019s housing crisis.The announcement is expected to come on Wednesday as the lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, hands down the Liberal National party\u2019s $4bn budget. Schrinner told ABC Radio Brisbane the council wants homeowners to put their properties back into the long-term rental market rather than listing them on sites such as Airbnb.  What we see is renters are being affected with rents going up significantly, and then those that are wanting to get a rental property are having real difficulty at the moment getting access to anything. If owners had these properties in the market for short-term, overnight stays \u2013 that is their choice, but what they\u2019ll be facing now is a 50% increase in their rates.  Schrinner said the rate hike will not affect owners who only rent out a single room, granny flat or shared accommodation.  Updated at 1.00am BST    12.46am    Another day of monitoring energy flows within and between states.  One thing, though, needs to be cleared up. The Australia Energy Regulator, along with other members of the Energy Security Board, will be meeting with generators to discuss the strained market.  Energy ministers are NOT expected to take part, an AER spokesperson has just clarified with the Guardian. (Clare Savage, AER\u2019s chair, made comments on radio this morning which may have implied ministers would be tuning in, but that\u2019s not the case \u2013 for now at least.)  Meanwhile, in the market itself, there are no updates yet of the status of level 3 lack of reserve warnings for each of the five states within the National Electricity Market from the Australian Energy Markets Operator. First thing this morning, Aemo said it had \u201csuccessfully directed generators, which hadn\u2019t bid into the market, to be available\u201d.  In another hint of the arm-twisting going on, the regulator said today:  Today, AEMO continues to encourage generators across the NEM through our lack of reserve (LOR) notices in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to bid their availability into the market, rather than being directed to do so.  (The underlining was in the original statement, to underscore the point, presumably.) Anyway, ahead of today\u2019s regulators and generators\u2019 meeting Electrical Trades Union has blasted \u201c10 years of regulatory neglect\u201d and called for an immediate review of the regulatory frameworks that make up the Nem.ETU\u2019s Queensland state secretary Peter Ong said \u201cthese warnings of blackouts and supply shortages are symptomatic of private energy companies gaming a system thathas for years had plenty of acronyms and boards but very little actual regulation\u201d. (He\u2019s right they do have a lot of acronyms.) Ong said:  Australia is one of the world\u2019s leading coal and gas producers, yet we have the absurd situation where we are held to ransom by multinational, tax-avoiding, gas companies who export massive amounts of gas at exorbitant prices while withholding supply to maximise profit in eastern Australia. While we also have coal companies exporting large quantities overseas rather than providing it to generate power. We urge [Queensland energy minister Mick] de Brenni to call on the federal government to undertake an immediate review of Australia\u2019s broken National Electricity Market that is responsible for this ongoing crisis. Secondly, we call on the state government to use the upcoming budget and energy lan to accelerate construction of public-owned renewable generation and storage assets.

The 78-year-old founder of Derryn Hinch\u2019s Justice party confirmed the news on Twitter on Tuesday night. \u201cYes ... it is true,\u201d Hinch tweeted in response to a question about his run.

Updated at 12.05am BST    11.57pm   Head of energy regulator says price cap not to blame for energy crisis  In what I assume will be an ongoing theme for the day, Clare Savage, chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, has refuted claims the price cap is to blame for generators choosing to withhold energy from the grid.  Savage was on ABC Radio Melbourne and said she would meet with generators today to encourage them to bid to market if they have generation available.    There is a process to make sure that generators can recover their costs. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an excuse.  If generators have supply available they need to be bidding it into the market. They will receive the $300 which is the price cap and if they have costs in excess of that, they will be recovered.  Savage conceded that the regulator would consider lifting the cap beyond 300 megawatts per hour, but added it was no excuse for generators not to bid. She also said the volatility of the wholesale market would not likely affect consumers.   I think it\u2019s really important to distinguish between what is a wholesale market. There\u2019s a lot of difficulty in the wholesale market right now \u2026 but retail customers are largely protected from that.    Updated at 12.00am BST    11.41pm    Bill Shorten to highlight wider economic benefits of NDIS NDIS minister Bill Shorten will today address the Where to From Here? national disability conference, with the Sydney Morning Herald reporting he will announce his focus will be to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the NDIS\u201d. Shorten says there is \u201csignificant\u201d opportunities to improve the system, with an eye on employment outcomes, adding that people usually take \u201ca narrow view of sustainability.\u201d   If the NDIS is effective, there\u2019s a huge return on our investment in years to come. Not only does this return include stronger meaningful social and economic connections for people with disabilities, there\u2019s also a financial return to governments ... including reducing health, employment, social security, housing and justice costs.    Updated at 11.47pm BST    11.24pm   Sarah Hanson-Young says Australia 'held hostage' by energy companies  Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has told ABC News energy producers are \u201cgaming the system\u201d, adding that Australia was being \u201cheld hostage\u201d due to a \u201cbroken\u201d system.  Hanson-Young called for a greater government response to reform regulations, which she implied were being manipulated by corporations that are holding energy supply to profit from schemes encouraging them to produce more energy.    It\u2019s quite clear that the rules are broken, the market is broken. This whole system needs to be reviewed.  They\u2019re effectively \u2026 withholding supply, waiting for the energy agency to beg them to bid into the market, only then to get more money through compensation. This is highway robbery by these big corporations, and it\u2019s time they were pulled into line.It\u2019s polluting, it\u2019s dirty fuel that\u2019s getting increasingly expensive, most of it is foreign-owned, the profits go overseas, and they don\u2019t pay too much tax. Australians are sick of it.    Updated at 11.30pm BST    11.13pm   SA premier urges federal intervention in east coast energy crisis  South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas is urging the federal government to intervene in the energy crisis gripping the east coast, saying the situation is a result of a \u201cmarket failure on a grand scale\u201d. Malinauskas was speaking to the ABC and said his government were investing $600m into a hydrogen power plant to ensure the state has a \u201cstable and secure\u201d energy source.   We are witnessing market failure on a grand scale \u2026 across the national electricity market in a way that I think a range of policymakers should be deeply ashamed of. We are in a first-world country that is energy rich, and the fact we\u2019ve now got Australians being told to turn porch lights off to keep the system going, I think that is somewhat of an embarrassment.    Updated at 11.18pm BST    11.01pm   RBA boss says inflation could hit 7%  Last night the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, was on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 giving a rare insight into his thinking.  Lowe said he was determined to ensure inflation is returned to 2-3%, while warning it might reach 7% by the end of the year, well above the 6% forecast by the bank only a couple of weeks ago.    We\u2019ll do what\u2019s necessary to get inflation back to 2-3%. It\u2019s unclear at the moment how far interest rates will need to go up to get that. I think by the end of the year inflation will get too close to 7%, and we need to chart a course to bring it back down.   Lowe stressed that interest rates had been at \u201cemergency levels\u201d in response to the pandemic, and that the situation needed to \u201cgradually return to normal\u201d.   I say that because the midpoint of our inflation target is 2.5%, so an interest rate of 2.5% in inflation-adjusted terms is really an interest rate of zero, which in historical terms is a very low number. How fast we get to 2.5%, indeed whether we get to 2.5%, is going to be determined by events.    Updated at 11.04pm BST    10.46pm   Energy boss says price cap 'incentivising' generators to withhold power  Australian Energy Council chief executive Sarah McNamara says the price cap might be \u201cincentivising\u201d generators to withhold power. McNamara was on RN Breakfast this morning and she blamed the price cap of $300 per megawatt hour \u2013 which she said is \u201csignificantly below\u201d the wholesale cost of electricity for most generators \u2013 for the energy crisis.   Some generators have responded by preferring in some cases to withdraw supply and wait to be directed on the market operator. There is sufficient capacity in the market but the situation is tight. The price has the effect of incentivising some generators to sit on the sidelines and await direction from the market. That\u2019s because those generators are being squeezed between the price cap and their high input costs. Now, either way, because we\u2019re in an administered pricing situation, there is a compensation regime available, and the industry is in conversations with the regulator and the market operator about how these things work. But the truth is, we\u2019re in a unique situation, and we\u2019re deep in the weeds of market rules that hadn\u2019t been engaged with before by many of the market participants. So it\u2019s really an unprecedented set of circumstances .   Updated at 10.51pm BST    10.27pm   Mask mandates to ease at airports  Mask mandates are set to be eased in airport terminals across Australia after health officials found the rule was \u201cno longer proportionate\u201d, just days before Anthony Albanese meets with state and territory leaders. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) said in a statement issued late on Tuesday that it was proposing mask wearing in airport terminals \u201cno longer be mandated\u201d from as early as this Friday night:  The AHPPC notes that all states and territories have relaxed mask mandates in most settings within the community and considers that it is no longer proportionate to mandate mask use in airport terminals. The AHPPC proposes that mask wearing in airport terminals no longer be mandated from as early as midnight 17 June 2022.   Despite the proposal to no longer make them compulsory, the AHPPC said it \u201ccontinues to strongly recommend continued mask wearing in airport terminals and other indoor settings, especially where physical distancing is not possible\u201d. The body said masks minimised Covid-19 and influenza transmission and protected \u201cthose who are unable to get vaccinated and people who have a higher risk of developing severe illness\u201d. The federal government responded to the new advice, saying it anticipated the travelling public would \u201cnotice this change in the days following Friday as individual state and territory jurisdictions make the necessary changes to their public health orders\u201d. The health minister, Mark Butler, and the transport minister, Catherine King, thanked \u201cthe thousands of people who work in our airport terminals around Australia who have followed the rules to keep us safe\u201d and \u201cthe travelling public for continuing to comply with the ongoing regulations\u201d. The AHPPC brings together state, territory and federal chief medical and health officers. The prime minister is due to meet with state premiers and territory chief ministers at a national cabinet meeting on Friday.   Updated at 11.09pm BST    10.27pm   Good Morning  Good morning from bitterly cold Sydney, this is Mostafa Rachwani and I\u2019ll be taking you through the news today.  We begin with the Fair Work Commission, which will deliver its verdict on an increase to the minimum wage. The commission\u2019s expert panel, headed by president Iain Ross, will announce its decision at 10am, after the new government backed a 5.1% increase, in line with inflation.  Prime minister Anthony Albanese will be holding his first cabinet meeting in Queensland, in the manufacturing city of Gladstone, in a bid to reconnect with locals. The meeting will be paired with a lunchtime civic reception for local residents to ask questions of the MPs. Last night Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said in a rare interview that the RBA expects inflation to hit 7% by the end of the year, warning he\u2019d \u201cdo what\u2019s necessary\u201d to keep inflation down.  Meanwhile, all eyes will be on the energy crisis after each of the five states in the national electricity market (Nem) \u2013 from Queensland to Tasmania \u2013 had a forecast shortfall of electricity, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). Aemo has warned Victoria could next face blackouts this evening.  We\u2019ll keep you updated on that as well as everything else happening today.   Updated at 10.36pm BST "

                    "body": "\n 1.04am  \nSummary\n\nThank you for joining us for today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.\nWe will be pausing our live reporting overnight and returning in the morning.\nIn the meantime, you can read our comprehensive summary of the days\u2019 events in our summary below.\n\nUkraine\u2019s army said it had launched airstrikes on Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, causing \u201csignificant losses\u201d to Russian forces. The military\u2019s southern operational command said it had used \u201caimed strikes with the use of various forces\u201d on the island. The military operation \u201ccontinues\u201d, it added.\n\n\nThe military situation for Ukraine\u2019s defenders in the eastern Donbas is \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, officials say. Some 568 civilians are thought to be holed up in Sievierodonetsk\u2019s Azot chemical plant, as Russian attacks intensified in an effort to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said Lysychansk was getting shelled \u201cen masse\u201d. \n\n\nRussian forces have captured several settlements near the embattled eastern cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. The head of the Sievierodonetsk district military administration, Roman Vlasenko, said the frontline village of Toshkivka had not been under Ukrainian control since Monday. Russian forces also reportedly captured Pidlisne and Mala Dolyna, located southwest of Sievierodonetsk, and saw success near the Hirske settlement in Luhansk. \n\n\nAt least 15 civilians were killed in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region by Russian shelling on Tuesday, according to regional governor Oleh Synegubov.\n\n\nMass mobilisation is \u201cabout to happen\u201d in Russia with the Kremlin recruiting people in poorer regions to fight in Ukraine, according to western officials. Officials also said there was \u201cmore chatter\u201d about Vladimir Putin\u2019s health and \u201cmore speculation\u201d about who would replace him in Russia. However, there does not appear to be an \u201cimmediate threat\u201d to the Russian president\u2019s position from the elite or the general population, they said.\n\n\nA fire that broke out after Ukrainian forces allegedly attacked oil rigs in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea is approaching an oil well, according to a pro-Russian official. Three people were wounded and seven people are still reportedly missing. The Russian-backed leader of annexed Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, blamed Kyiv for the attack.\n\n\nRussia has demanded that Lithuania immediately lift a ban on the transit of goods on an EU sanctions list across its territory to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Patrushev, said the consequences of the ban \u201cwill have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania\u201d.\n\n\nThe US attorney general, Merrick Garland, visited Ukraine on Tuesday to discuss efforts to prosecute individuals involved in war crimes during Russia\u2019s invasion, a justice department official said. Garland met with Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, and announced a War Crimes Accountability team that will work to identify and prosecute anyone who committed war crimes in Ukraine. \u201cThere is no hiding place for war criminals,\u201d Garland said.\n\n\nThe Kremlin has said that two captured US volunteers are not covered by the Geneva conventions and could face the death penalty. Russian media claimed that two of three US volunteers missing in Ukraine have been captured and are being held by pro-Russian separatist forces. The Kremlin has denied it knows the location of the two men. \n\n\nGerman self-propelled howitzers have arrived in Ukraine in the first delivery of heavy weapons promised by Berlin. \u201cWe have replenishment!\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov announced. \u201cThe German Panzerhaubitze 2000 with trained Ukrainian crews joined the Ukrainian artillery family.\u201d\n\n\nTurkey should be cautious about delivering more weapons to Ukraine, the head of Turkey\u2019s weapons production agency said. Remarks by Ismail Demir to the Wall Street Journal show how Ankara is increasingly playing both sides of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in contrast to other Nato allies, just months after Turkish-made drones played a critical role in Kyiv\u2019s defence against Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n\nTurkey\u2019s military delegation will travel to Russia this week to discuss a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea to export Ukrainian grain, according to Turkish presidency sources. A four-way meeting between Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and the United Nations will be held in Istanbul in the coming weeks, possibly with the participation of Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the sources said.\n\n\nEuropean countries are united in their support for granting Ukraine the status of European Union member candidate, Luxembourg\u2019s foreign affairs minister said. Jean Asselborn told reporters: \u201cWe are working towards the point where we tell Putin that Ukraine belongs to Europe, that we will also defend the values that Ukraine defends.\u201d\n\n\nThe UK government is \u201cdetermined\u201d to impose further sanctions on Russia and will continue to do so until Moscow fully withdraws from Ukraine, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said. She told parliament that she would be travelling to Turkey on Wednesday to discuss options to help get grain out of Odesa. Prime minister Boris Johnson also warned of \u201cgrowing fatigue\u201d around the war and said any concessions to Russian president Vladimir Putin would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d.\n\n\nEstonia summoned the Russian ambassador on Tuesday to protest an \u201cextremely serious\u201d violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter. The Estonian foreign ministry said the helicopter had flown over a point in the south-east without permission on June 18.\n\n\nRussia has blocked the website of the Telegraph for its reporting on the invasion of Ukraine. The newspaper said it had been accused of \u201cdisseminating false information about a special military operation by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n 12.29am  \n\nBritish prime minister Boris Johnson warned of \u201cgrowing fatigue\u201d around the war and said any concessions to Russian president Vladimir Putin would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d.\nJohnson promised the UK would be \u201csteadfast\u201d in supporting Ukrainians and vowed to ensure \u201cfresh political, military and financial support from the international community\u201d to the war-torn country, his official spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s concern is that it may not be at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds, because of ... some of those wider global challenges we\u2019re facing, not least on inflation around the world,\u201d according to the official.\n\nJohnson told Cabinet that \u201cwe must not allow anyone to believe that making concessions to Putin would lead to anything but disaster\u201d, as this could be \u201cperceived to be a reward for their unwarranted aggression\u201d and \u201cwould embolden not just Russia but their allies and have an impact on UK security and on our economy,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nAt the Cabinet meeting, Johnson also said Britain would work to \u201cdrain the grain from Ukraine\u201d as \u201cthe bombardment of cities and infrastructure and the blockade of ports is crippling Ukraine\u2019s ability to export its produce\u201d.\n\n\n\n 12.07am  \n\nThe United States has called it \u201cappalling\u201d for the Kremlin to suggest that two US citizens captured while fighting for Ukraine against the Russian invasion could face execution.\nJohn Kirby, a White House spokesman, spoke to reporters on Tuesday after the Kremlin spokesman said the two men are not protected by the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war. \n\nIt\u2019s appalling that a public official in Russia would even suggest the death penalty for two American citizens that were in Ukraine.\u201d \n\nKirby said the Kremlin was being at minimum reckless with the comments.\n\nWhether they actually mean what they\u2019re saying here, and that this could be an outcome, that they could levy a death penalty against two Americans that were fighting in Ukraine, or that they just feel that it\u2019s a responsible thing for a major power to do, to talk about doing this... either one of them is equally alarming.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 11.37pm  \n\nAmid Russia\u2019s brutal assault on Ukraine\u2019s eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, a few images capture a moment of quiet as Ukrainian service members help a small dog found in a destroyed building in the ruined city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.11pm  \nToday so far\n\n\nRussia has advanced in the Donbas, capturing the frontline village of Toshkivka earlier and continuing on to capture Pidlisne and Mala Dolyna later today. The twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk are sustaining heavy damages as the Russians intensify their attacks, with at least 568 civilians believed to be holed up in Sievierodonetsk\u2019s Azot chemical plant.\nThe Kremlin has not provided the US any additional details on the whereabouts of the two American military veterans captured in Ukraine, Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, who were volunteering to defend Ukraine against Russian invaders when they were captured by Russian forces. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, will be speaking with their families virtually tomorrow, as well as the family of US basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia since February for allegedly possessing hashish oil. In May, the US state department determined that Griner had been wrongfully detained and spokesman Ned Price reiterated today the department\u2019s commitment in securing her release. Her wife has accused Russia of holding her as a political pawn. \nDespite the state department\u2019s commitment to securing Griner\u2019s release, over the weekend, the US embassy in Moscow botched a phone call between Griner and her wife - the first phone call between the couple in Griner\u2019s four month-long detention. Price and the White House apologised for the mishap today and Price said the call has since been rescheduled. \nAt least 15 civilians were killed in the Kharkiv region today by Russian shelling.\nEstonia has summoned the Russian ambassador to protest the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on 18 June.\n\n\n\n\n 10.51pm  \n\nAntony Blinken, US secretary of state, will have a virtual conversation tomorrow with the families of both the American hostages and wrongfully detained abroad - that would mean the families of military veterans Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, who were volunteering to defend Ukraine against Russian invaders, as well as the family of US basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia since February for allegedly possessing hashish oil. Her wife has accused Russia of holding Griner as a political pawn. \n\n\n\n\n 10.34pm  \nRussia advances in eastern Ukraine\n\nEarlier today, Russia captured the frontline village of Toshkivka near the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region. Continuing on, Russian forces captured Pidlisne and Mala Dolyna, located southwest of Sievierodonetsk, and saw success near the Hirske settlement in the Luhansk oblast. \n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.01pm BST\n\n\n 10.06pm  \n\nA Russian mine detonated on a beach in the Odesa oblast, damaging one house. Local authorities reissued warnings to not visit beaches or swim during this time. \n\n\n\n\n 9.47pm  \n\nAt least 15 civilians were killed in the Kharkiv region today by Russian shelling, Reuters is reporting. \nSix people have died in and around Kharkiv, and another six in Chuhuiv, located to the southeast, regional governor Oleh Synegubov said. Three have died in Zolochiv, located to the northwest of the city.\n\n\n\n 9.30pm  \n\nHundreds gathered today in Lviv for the funeral of 27-year-old Artem Dymyd, who was killed defending Ukraine in the Donetsk region on 18 June. He was living in the US when Russian forces first invaded his homeland, and his first instinct was to immediately return and fight. \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.22pm BST\n\n\n 9.06pm  \n\nEstonia has summoned the Russian ambassador to protest the violation of its airspace by a Russian helicopter on 18 June. \n\n\n\n\n 8.42pm  \n\nThe Kremlin has not provided the US any additional details on the whereabouts of two Americans captured in Ukraine, according to Ned Price, a spokesman for the US state department. \n\u201cWe have no additional details beyond what\u2019s been reported in the media,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in direct contact with Russian authorities. We have not been provided, either by Russian authorities or by Russian proxy forces or any other entity, with additional details on the whereabouts of these Americans. We are pursuing every channel, every opportunity we have, to learn more and support their families in this difficult hour.\u201d\nAlexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh were two US military veterans volunteering to defend Ukraine against Russian invaders when they were captured by Russian forces. The Kremlin acknowledged in an interview with MSNBC yesterday that Drueke and Huynh were being held and were under investigation for \u201ccrimes\u201d, but would not say more about where they were being held. \nThe Interfax news agency today reported that they were in the Russian-backed separatist region of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, where Britons Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin and Morroccan citizen Brahim Saadoun - also volunteer fighters - were sentenced to death earlier this month. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said Drueke and Huynh could also face the death penalty. \n\u201cWe have both publicly as well as privately called on the Russian government and its proxies to live up to their international obligations in their treatment of all individuals including those captured fighting in Ukraine,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe expect and, in fact, international law and the law of war expects and requires, all those captured on the battle field be treated humanely and with respect consistent with the laws of war.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\nLysychansk in the eastern Donbas is getting hit hard, with Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region, describing it as the city getting shelled \u201cen masse\u201d. \nHere are some images of what life is like in the Lysychansk at the moment: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.52pm BST\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nThe US state department spokesperson Ned Price has responded to the botched phone call between the US basketball star Brittney Griner and her wife by confirming that the call has been rescheduled. \nHe reiterated that the state department has classified Griner as \u201cwrongfully detained by Russia and has been wrongfully detained for far too long and whose case we are working on assiduously to see her released as quickly as can be achieved\u201d.\n\u201cWe deeply regret that Brittney Griner was unable to speak to her wife over the weekend because of a logistical error,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt was a mistake. It was a mistake that we have worked to rectify. As we said before, the call has been rescheduled and will take place in relatively short order.\u201d\nGriner had dialled into the US embassy in Moscow 11 times \u2013 the embassy was then to connect her with her wife in Phoenix \u2013 but apparently nobody was working the desk where the phone rang on Saturday. Price attributed this \u201clogistical error\u201d to restrictions put in place on the embassy by the Kremlin. \n\u201cIt was a logistical error that was compounded in part by the fact that our embassy in Moscow is under significant restrictions in terms of its staffing,\u201d Price said. \u201cWhen we have issues with the telephone system there, for example, the technicians are not located on site, in fact they\u2019re not even located in Russia. They have to be located in a third country because of the onerous restrictions that the Russian federation has placed on our embassy and its operations.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.45pm BST\n\n\n 7.18pm  \n\nThe White House has responded to yesterday\u2019s report by the Associated Press that the US state department bungled a scheduled phone call between the US basketball star Brittney Griner, who has been held in custody in Russia since February over the possession of hashish oil, and her wife \u2013 the first phone call the couple would have had in the entirety of the four months of Griner\u2019s detention. \n\n\u201cThis was such a big moment because this would have been the first time where I truly could tell if she\u2019s OK,\u201d Cherelle Griner told the Associated Press. \u201cThis would have been the first time for me to actually just hear her in real time and to truly know if she\u2019s OK or to know if she\u2019s seconds away from not being in existence anymore.\u201d\nBrittney Griner had tried to call 11 times over a period of several hours, dialling a number she\u2019d been given at the US embassy in Moscow, which the couple had been told would then patch the call through to Cherelle Griner in Phoenix. But each time, the call went unanswered because apparently nobody worked at that specific desk at the embassy on Saturdays.\n\nUpdated at 8.42pm BST\n\n\n 6.59pm  \nSummary\n\nIt\u2019s 9pm in Kyiv. Here is where we stand:\n\nUkraine\u2019s army said it had launched airstrikes on Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, causing \u201csignificant losses\u201d to Russian forces. In a post on Facebook, the military\u2019s southern operational command said it had used \u201caimed strikes with the use of various forces\u201d on the island.

Some 568 civilians are thought to be holed up in Sievierodonetsk\u2019s Azot chemical plant, as Russian attacks intensified in an effort to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.\n\n\nRussian troops have captured the frontline village of Toshkivka near the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region. The head of the Severodonetsk district military administration, Roman Vlasenko, said the village had not been under Ukrainian control since Monday, adding that the battle for Donbas was \u201cnow in full swing\u201d.\n\n\nMass mobilisation is \u201cabout to happen\u201d in Russia with the Kremlin recruiting people in poorer regions to fight in Ukraine, according to western officials.

The Kremlin, however, denied that it knew the location of the two men. A US state department official said the US disagrees \u201cvigorously\u201d with the Russian position that captured Americans are not covered by the Geneva convention.\n\n\nThe sister of Brahim Saadoun, the Moroccan man who was captured while serving in the Ukrainian military, has said she feared he has been abandoned by his own government and has called on the international community to \u201cclaim my brother\u201d. \u201cI just want any authority, anybody who is willing to help, to come and help,\u201d Iman Saadoun said in an interview with the Guardian, describing being left in limbo while seeking government support for him.\n\n\nTurkey should be cautious about delivering more weapons to Ukraine, the head of Turkey\u2019s weapons production agency said. Remarks by Ismail Demir to the Wall Street Journal show how Ankara is increasingly playing both sides of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in contrast to other Nato allies, just months after Turkish-made drones played a critical role in Kyiv\u2019s defence against Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n\nTurkey\u2019s military delegation will travel to Russia this week to discuss a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea to export Ukrainian grain, according to Turkish presidency sources.

My colleague Vivian Ho will be here shortly will the latest from Ukraine. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. \n\nUpdated at 8.48pm BST\n\n\n 6.52pm  \n\nDrone footage released on 19 June obtained by Reuters shows artillery strikes on the Ukrainian village of Toshkivka in the Luhansk region.\nThe aerial images show columns of smoke rising over several burned out buildings as shells blast approaching armoured vehicles.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.03pm BST\n\n\n 6.43pm  \n\nTurkey\u2019s military delegation will travel to Russia this week to discuss a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea to export Ukrainian grain, according to Turkish presidency sources.\nA four-way meeting between Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and the United Nations will be held in Istanbul in the coming weeks, possibly with the participation of Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Reuters cited the sources as saying.\nThe sources said the plan included creating three corridors from Ukraine\u2019s port city of Odesa under Kyiv\u2019s supervision, and that both Ukrainian and Russian food products would be shipped from there.\nBetween 30 and 35 million tonnes of grain could be shipped from there in the next six to eight months, the sources said. \nAsked about the plan\u2019s outline, UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric said \u201cthe discussions on these issues are continuing\u201d, without further elaborating.\nRussian state-owned news agency Tass confirmed plans for the talks, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.\n\n\n\n 6.26pm  \n\nUkraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said German self-propelled howitzers have \u201cfinally\u201d arrived in Ukraine, in the first delivery of heavy weapons promised by Berlin.\nReznikov tweeted that the Panzerhaubitze 2000 \u201care finally part of 155 mm howitzer arsenal of the Ukrainian artillery\u201d and thanked his German counterpart, Christine Lambrecht. \n\nThe Panzerhaubitze 2000 is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles).\nGermany pledged last month to send seven self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, adding to five such artillery systems the Netherlands has promised.\n\nUpdated at 6.42pm BST\n\n\n 6.05pm  \n\nKalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian group who triumphed at the 2022 Eurovision song contest, are to perform at Glastonbury festival for their first ever UK concert.\nTheir winning song, Stefania, blended hip-hop with the intricate flutes and heartfelt vocals of their national folk music, and saw a huge response from the public, who swept them to victory in the Eurovision phone voting \u2013 a clear demonstration of solidarity with Ukraine during the war with Russia.\n\nThe sextet will appear at the Truth stage on Friday night (technically early Saturday morning, at 1.10am), in the festival\u2019s fantastical, highly politicised Shangri-La area.\nFrontman Oleh Psiuk said: \u201cThis is the perfect place for our first ever British performance and we hope it will be the start of many in the UK. We are very grateful for all the support we receive from the people of Britain, both for us and our country, and we are preparing a very special Ukrainian surprise for the fans at Glastonbury.

How can you do this if you send tens of thousands of weapons to one side?\n\nDemir\u2019s comments show how Ankara is increasingly playing both sides of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in contrast to other Nato allies, the paper reports. \n\nAsked if Turkey would continue to supply weapons including Bayraktar TB-2 drones, which were instrumental in Ukraine\u2019s initial resistance to the Russian invasion, Demir replied:\n\nThere are things going on, but I\u2019m not in a position to say, but we are much more careful.\n\nHe added:\n\nWe have to be able to talk to both sides, someone should be close enough to both parties, to build trust.

Russian media has claimed that two of three US volunteers missing in Ukraine have been captured and are being held by pro-Russian separatist forces. The Kremlin, however, denied that it knew the location of the two men.\n\n\nThe sister of Brahim Saadoun, the Moroccan man who was captured while serving in the Ukrainian military, has said she feared he has been abandoned by his own government and has called on the international community to \u201cclaim my brother\u201d. \u201cI just want any authority, anybody who is willing to help, to come and help,\u201d Iman Saadoun said in an interview with the Guardian, describing being left in limbo while seeking government support for him.\n\n\nA senior Ukrainian government official and a business leader have been detained on suspicion of being part of an alleged Russian spy network, Ukraine\u2019s security service (SBU) said.

Just under half of all goods that usually transit through Lithuania, including coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology, are covered by a ban on Russian exports entering EU territory.\nThere is a different enforcement date for many of the goods. On 17 June the prohibition on Russian steel and iron ore came into force. The Lithuanian state railways said they would no longer allow these goods to be carried on its tracks.\n\nIn response, the region\u2019s governor, Anton Alikhanov, said ferry services from St Petersburg would take the strain and that there was no need to panic. That led to panic.\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry accused Lithuania of breaking international law and a series of agreements on the facilitation of transit from mainland Russia that had been agreed in 2004.

Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania.\u201d\n\n\nThe European Union ambassador to Russia, Markus Ederer, was summoned to the foreign ministry in Moscow over the issue. He said he had asked Russia to resolve the issue through diplomatic means.\n\n\nRussia has gathered almost all of its forces to storm the settlements near the embattled eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, according to Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar. \u201cDecisive\u201d battles are taking place in the area of Sievierodonetsk with the Russian leadership aiming to reach the borders of the Luhansk region by the end of the week, Maliar was quoted as saying.\n\n\nRussian officials have accused Ukraine of launching missile strikes against three gas rigs in the Black Sea south of Odesa, in an apparent escalation of Kyiv\u2019s attempts to weaken Russia\u2019s maritime dominance. Seven people were reported missing and three injured after the strikes on Monday, according to the head of occupied Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov.\n\n\nThree people were killed and seven people were injured by Russian shelling on the Kharkiv region in the last 24 hours, according to governor Oleh Synyehubov.\n\n\nTwo Americans captured in Ukraine are currently in the Russian-backed separatist region of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the Interfax news agency has reported, citing an unidentified source.

Appropriate measures are being worked out in an interdepartmental format and will be taken in the near future. Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania.\n\nThe RIA Nostovi Russian news agency quotes him saying that \u201cthe blockade by Lithuania, at the suggestion of Western countries, in violation of the norms and principles of international law, of the transit through its territory to the Kaliningrad region of a large group of goods \u2026 shows that one cannot trust not only the oral statements of the west, but also written ones.\u201d\nAt the same time as Patrushev was in Kaliningrad, the European Union ambassador to Russia was summoned to the foreign ministry in Moscow.\nAfter the meeting, Reuters reports Markus Ederer said he had asked Russia to resolve the issue through diplomatic means. He said it was not a blockade by Lithuania, as the transit of non-sanctioned goods continues. Lithuania argues that it is only preventing the shipment of goods across its territory in accordance with new EU sanctions that came into force at the weekend.\nReuters notes that their report of Ederer\u2019s meeting was produced in Russia, where the law restricts their coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 10.43am  \n\nThe Baltic states have asked for more financial support from the EU to handle Ukrainian refugees, the Lithuanian president\u2019s office has said.\n\u201cWe must share the financial burden, which at the moment is unproportionally assigned to national budgets.

It will also strengthen interregional ties in various fields.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10.13am BST\n\n\n 8.18am  \nRussia: 'western regimes' and 'illegitimate sanctions' to blame for any global grain shortage\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry has issued an opinion by the press secretary, Maria Zakharova, about the global grain situation. She cites statistics claiming that grain production and trade levels are higher than previous years, stating that \u201cthere will be more grain in the world\u201d. Zakharova goes on to write:\n\nRepresentatives of the west are using every platform, including the UN, to accuse Russia of reducing the amount of grain available on the market through its actions, allegedly throwing a wrench in grain operations which, according to the West, has sent prices for wheat and other grains up. In reality, though, there\u2019s more grain on the market than in previous years, and trade is up as well.\n\nShe claims that the causes of rising prices and shortages are\n\n\u201cSystematic errors made by the west when making forecasts for its agricultural policy.\u201d\n\u201cGlobal inflation caused by short-sighted financial and monetary mechanisms that the west used during the pandemic.\u201d\n\u201cThe ill-conceived transition of Europe and North America to green energy based on the forced introduction of bio fuel technologies.\u201d\n\u201cIllegitimate sanctions that have disrupted the established commodity-money chains.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to say: \u201cWith regard to whether famine is a realistic scenario, experts increasingly foresee a pessimistic outcome. They believe that many nations will be impacted and even more will become destitute. The western regimes that instigate and cause destruction should be blamed for that.\u201d\nYesterday, the European Union\u2019s senior diplomat, Josep Borrell, described the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine as \u201ca real war crime\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 10.14am BST\n\n\n 7.55am  \n\nReuters reports the Georgian prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili, has said at an economic conference in Qatar that his country is committed to joining Nato, but must solve its territorial problems with Russia first.\nGeorgia is sandwiched between Russia in the north, with Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to its south. The breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are internationally recognised as part of Georgia\u2019s territory, although a handful of states, including Russia, officially recognise them.\n\nUpdated at 10.15am BST\n\n\n 7.47am  \n\nThree people were killed and seven people were injured by Russian shelling on the Kharkiv region in the last 24 hours, according to a post on Telegram by the governor of the area, Oleh Synyehubov.\nHe claimed that a fire at a gas processing plant in Izium is being fought after the strikes, and that an educational building in the Kyiv district of Kharkiv was 40% destroyed after the attacks.\nHe said that fighting continues in the Izium area, but that Ukrainian forces \u201crepel enemy attacks and hold their positions securely.\u201d\nThe claims have not been independently verified.\n\n\n\n 7.29am  \n\nSerhai Haidai, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Luhansk, has confirmed that the regular free evacuation train from Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine will run to Lviv via Dnipro this afternoon.\n\n\n\n 6.56am  \nRussian journalist auctions Nobel peace prize, sells for $103.5m\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize that Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov was auctioning off to raise money for Ukrainian child refugees has sold for $103.5m (\u00a384.5m), shattering the record for a Nobel.\nMuratov, who was awarded the gold medal in October 2021, helped found the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta and was the publication\u2019s editor-in-chief when it shut down in March amid the Kremlin\u2019s clampdown on journalists and public dissent in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nIt was Muratov\u2019s idea to auction off his prize, having already announced he was donating the accompanying $500,000 cash award to charity. The idea of the donation, he said, \u201cis to give the children refugees a chance for a future\u201d.\nMuratov has said the proceeds will go directly to Unicef in its efforts to help children displaced by the war in Ukraine. Melted down, the 175 grams of 23-karat gold contained in Muratov\u2019s medal would be worth about $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n 6.51am  \nUkraine claims first success with western-donated Harpoon anti-ship missiles: UK MoD\n\nUkrainian forces claimed their first successful use of western-donated Harpoon anti-ship missiles to engage Russian maritime forces, British intelligence says.\nThe target of the attack on 17 June was almost certainly the Russian naval tug Spasatel Vasily Bekh, which was delivering weapons and personnel to Snake Island in the north-western Black Sea, according to the latest UK ministry of defence report. \nThe destruction of the Russian vessel on a resupply mission \u201cdemonstrates the difficulty Russia faces when attempting to support their forces occupying Snake Island\u201d the report adds.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of Russian vessels, including the cruiser Moskva, to be damaged or destroyed by Ukraine during the conflict.\nUkrainian coastal defence capability has largely neutralised Russia\u2019s ability to establish sea control and project maritime force in the north-western Black Sea.\nThis has undermined the viability of Russia\u2019s original operational design for the invasion, which involved holding the Odesa region at risk from the sea.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.29am  \nDenmark declares \u2018early warning\u2019 over Russia gas supply worries\n\nDenmark\u2019s energy agency declared a first level \u201cearly warning\u201d alert over worries of its gas supply, due to uncertainty on energy imports from Russia due to the war in Ukraine.\nThe European Union has established a system to allow member states to flag up impending energy supply difficulties using three ascending levels of alerts - beginning with \u201cearly warning\u201d, followed by \u201calert\u201d, then \u201cemergency\u201d.\nThe system allows for mutual assistance from other EU countries, but could also mean a start to rationing supplies.\nOn Monday, the deputy director of the Danish Energy Agency, Martin Hansen, issued the first level warning.\n\u201cThis is a serious situation we are facing and it has been exacerbated by the reduction in supplies,\u201d Hansen said in a statement, as reported by Reuters.\nCurrently Denmark\u2019s gas stocks are about 75% full, \u201cand gas has been added in recent days\u201d, the agency added.\nThe declaration comes after Danish energy company Orsted announced at the end of May that delivery of Russian gas to the Scandinavian country would be suspended from June 1, after Orsted refused to settle the payment in rubles.\nRussia is one of the main sources of natural gas imports in Denmark, according to the Danish Energy Agency.\nThe Netherlands also announced Monday it will lift restrictions on coal-fired power generation, a day after Germany and Austria took similar steps to alleviate their reliance on Russian gas supplies.\n\n\n\n 6.21am  \n\nRussia is holding more than 1,500 Ukrainian civilians in prisons, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has alleged.\n\nMore than 1,500 civilians are being held in Russian prisons - they are in Rostov, Kursk, they are in jail, they are being held as prisoners of war, although they should not be prisoners of war... They should be released,\u201d Vereshchuk said during a televised briefing on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n 6.00am  \nMoscow to summon EU ambassador later today\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry is set to summon European Union ambassador to Moscow, Markus Ederer, later today over Lithuania\u2019s ban of the transit of goods under EU sanctions through Kaliningrad.\nVilnius banned the transit of goods under European Union sanctions through Lithuanian territory to and from the Russian exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland, citing EU sanction rules.\nAnton Alikhanov, Kaliningrad\u2019s governor, told Russian television late on Sunday. \n\nThis is, of course, a situation, that can be resolved by diplomatic means,\nAs far as I know, tomorrow Marcus Ederer, the European Union ambassador to Russia, will be summoned to the foreign ministry .... and he will be told of the appropriate conditions involved here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.48am  \nRussia threatens retaliation over goods transit ban\n\nRussia has threatened to retaliate over Lithuania\u2019s ban on the transit of some goods across its territory to the Russian Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad.\nThe move by the government in Vilnius was described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d in Moscow, where the Russian foreign office said they reserved the right to respond to protect their national interest.\nPutin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, further escalated tensions on Monday by threatening a response to what he said was an \u201cillegal move\u201d. \n\nThis decision is really unprecedented. It\u2019s a violation of everything. We consider this illegal. The situation is more than serious \u2026 We need a serious in-depth analysis in order to work out our response.\u201d\n\nWedged between Lithuania to its north and east, and Poland to its south, Kaliningrad is about 800 miles (1,300km) from Moscow and relies on much of its supplies coming in by rail.\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry said Vilnius must reverse the \u201copenly hostile\u201d move. \n\nIf cargo transit between the Kaliningrad region and the rest of the Russian Federation via Lithuania is not fully restored in the near future, then Russia reserves the right to take actions to protect its national interests,\u201d it said.\n\n\nLithuania\u2019s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said Moscow was spreading false information and that the state railway service was acting lawfully by merely implementing the EU\u2019s sanctions regime prohibiting the supply of steel or goods made from iron ore to Russia.\nLandsbergis said that under half of the goods usually supplied by transiting across Lithuania would be covered by the sanctions regime over time, with the ban on steel coming into force on 17 June.\n\u201cI think there was some false information, not for the first time, announced by the Russian authorities, but I\u2019m glad that we have a chance to explain this,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, about slightly less than half of goods that transit Lithuania are on the sanctions list, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all of them are under sanctions right now.\n\u201cBecause there are different wind-down periods, and some of it, for example oil, will be sanctioned just at the end of the year, starting from December, even though the authorities have announced it is sanctioned already, which is not true actually.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 5.38am  \nSummary and welcome\n\nHello it\u2019s Samantha Lock back with you as we continue to report all the latest news from Ukraine.\nThe Russian foreign ministry is set to summon European Union ambassador to Moscow, Markus Ederer, later today over Lithuania\u2019s ban of the transit of goods under EU sanctions through Kaliningrad.\nHere are all the other major developments as of 8am in Kyiv.\n\nRussia has demanded that Lithuania immediately lift a ban on the transit of goods on an EU sanctions list across its territory to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry demanded Vilnius immediately reverse what it described as an \u201copenly hostile\u201d move, warning Russia would respond to protect its interests. The ministry also said it will summon the European Union ambassador to Moscow, Markus Ederer, over the ban.\n\n\nRussia has gathered almost all of its forces to storm the settlements near the embattled eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, according to Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar. \u201cDecisive\u201d battles are taking place in the area of Sievierodonetsk with the Russian leadership aiming to reach the borders of the Luhansk region by the end of the week, Maliar was quoted as saying.\n\n\nRussian officials have accused Ukraine of launching missile strikes against three gas rigs in the Black Sea south of Odesa, in an apparent escalation of Kyiv\u2019s attempts to weaken Russia\u2019s maritime dominance. Seven people were reported missing and three injured after the strikes on Monday, according to the head of occupied Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov.\n\n\nA food warehouse in Ukraine\u2019s southern port city of Odesa was destroyed by a Russian missile attack on Monday, according to the Ukrainian military. The military said Russian forces fired 14 missiles at southern Ukraine during a three-hour barrage \u201cin impotent anger at the successes of our troops\u201d. No civilians were killed, it said.\nA Nobel peace prize won by Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov has sold for a record $103.5m at auction. Muratov sold the medal to raise funds for Ukrainian children displaced by the war.\nRussia\u2019s blockade of the export of millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain is a war crime, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said. \u201cWe call on Russia to deblockade the ports \u2026 It is inconceivable, one cannot imagine that millions of tonnes of wheat remain blocked in Ukraine while in the rest of the world people are suffering hunger,\u201d he said.\n\n\nTurkey said it does not consider next week\u2019s Nato summit as a final deadline for resolving its objections to Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance. Turkish presidential spokesperson, Ibrahim Kalin, reported no breakthrough in talks in Brussels but said discussions between Ankara, Stockholm and Helsinki will continue.\n\n\nAmericans captured in Ukraine have been described by Moscow as \u201cmercenaries\u201d engaged in illegal activities and should take responsibility for their \u201ccrimes\u201d. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the detained men were not covered by the Geneva conventions as they were not regular troops, according to Russia\u2019s RIA news agency.\n\n\nThe United States is in talks with Canada and other allies to further restrict Moscow\u2019s energy revenue by imposing a price cap on Russian oil, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe are talking about price caps or a price exception \u2026 that would push down the price of Russian oil and depress Putin\u2019s revenues, while allowing more oil supply to reach the global market,\u201d she said.\n\n\nThe former director of the British special forces said the UK must \u201cprepare for war\u201d as a deterrent against Russia. The comment by Gen Sir Adrian Bradshaw came after the new head of the British army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, told troops they must prepare \u201cto fight in Europe once again\u201d.\n\n\nPutin fears the \u201cspark of democracy\u201d spreading to Russia, according to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz who said the Russian president was trying to divide Europe and return to a world dominated by spheres of influence. \u201cThe Russian President must accept that there is a community of law-based democracies in his neighbourhood that is growing ever closer together. He clearly fears the spark of democracy spreading to his country,\u201d Scholz told the Muenchner Merkur newspaper.\n\n\nThe upcoming decision whether to grant Ukraine candidacy for membership to the EU is making Russia \u201cvery nervous\u201d, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address on Monday night. \u201cWe are moving towards the main decision of the European Council, which will be adopted on Friday. As I predicted, Russia is very nervous about our activity.\u201d\n\n\nPalaces, yachts and vineyards reportedly provided to Vladimir Putin by friends and oligarchs can now be linked to what appears to be an informal network holding assets worth more than $4.5bn (\u00a33.7bn). A digital paper trail appears to suggest an array of holiday homes and other assets reportedly used by the Russian president are linked through a common email domain name, LLCInvest.ru.\n\n\nRussia\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Andrey Kelin, is to be banned from the parliamentary estate in Westminster \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, according to a message sent out by the Commons Speaker and the Lord Speaker this morning. The ban, which also applies to all other accredited Russian diplomats and officials in the UK, was confirmed in writing for the first time.\n\n\nThe editor of the Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta auctioned his Nobel peace prize medal, which sold for $103.5m (\u00a384.5m). The proceeds will go to helping children displaced by the war in Ukraine. Dmitry Muratov, whose 23-carat gold medal will go on sale in New York on Monday, said the sale was \u201can act of solidarity\u201d with the 14 million Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion, which he called \u201ca tragedy\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.59am BST\n"

                    "body": "  9.18am   The day that was, Wednesday 8 June  That is where we will leave the live blog for Wednesday. Here\u2019s what happened:  Federal, state and territory energy ministers have agreed following an emergency meeting to allow the Australian energy market operator to store gas to combat price spikes, and to give regulators more power over the energy market to provide more transparency. The ministers have also agreed to advance a national transition plan. ANZ, NAB and Commonwealth Bank all followed Westpac and passed on the full rate rise announced by the Reserve Bank yesterday. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has vowed to review the former government\u2019s decision to lease Port of Darwin to a Chinese company. The Nadesalingam family left Perth on their way back to the regional town of Biloela in Queensland after the new Labor government granted them bridging visas. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be given more resources to deal with the massive rise in passport applications and the associated logjam it has created. The high court ruled that laws allowing dual nationals to be stripped of their Australian citizenship for suspected terrorist activities are unconstitutional. The high court also ruled that the detention of an Aboriginal non-citizen was not unlawful, because he was detained before a landmark decision that found they were beyond the reach of the aliens power. The chief executive of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), Martin Hoffman, resigned. Tasmania announced plans to raise the age of detention from 10 to 14. There were 59 Covid-19 deaths reported across Australia.      9.13am   A name change for the Murugappans  You might have seen the family heading home to Biloela \u2013 the Nadesalingam family \u2013 previously referred to in our reportage as the Murugappan family. The family was known as the Murugappans for a number of years in Australia. We\u2019ve asked the family, and they have asked to be known now, collectively, as the Nadesalingam family. There are four people in the family: Nadesalingam Murugappan (known as Nades), Kokilapathmapriya Nadesalingam (known as Priya) and their two Australian-born daughters, Kopika and Tharnicaa.  Murugappan is Nades\u2019s second name. It is common for Tamil families to use a patronymic naming convention, with the father\u2019s first name taken as a second name by other family members.  Updated at 9.35am BST    9.12am    On whether the capacity market mechanism includes coal, Bowen says he supports new technologies, particularly storage technologies and renewables. He says the system will be expert-led and designed by the energy security board, which will have a draft out in the near future. He says having Aemo have some national gas storage would have helped alleviate the issues faced last week. He says the crisis is the result of poor planning under the previous government and if the new government implements its policies, he doesn\u2019t accept that it\u2019s inevitable that these crises will continue.  Updated at 9.16am BST    9.05am    Bowen: lack of planning led to crisis in energy market Bowen says ministers will work towards the national transition plan in the lead-up to the July meeting, saying the reason the crisis in the energy market has emerged is that there hasn\u2019t been enough planning about the changes necessary. He said:  We need more transmission, we need more renewables, we need more storage. Now we have the integrated systems plan in Australia. Which is a world\u2019s best practice document in relation to energy to electricity transmission, about poles and wires and big transmission across the country. That\u2019s a world class document.  He said the integrated systems plan will become a national transition agreement.  I stress this meeting was never designed to solve all the problems in one go, but it does give us more tools, gives the regulators more tools, to do the work that is necessary. We received very important and useful briefings from the regulators about the tools they would like. And we agreed to give them those tools. And also we made those other agreements that I\u2019ve referred to.    Updated at 9.13am BST    9.03am   Energy minister press conference  Energy minister Chris Bowen is speaking after the emergency meeting of state and territory energy ministers. He says they have received briefings from the regulator, the energy market operator, and the chair of the Energy Security Board. The ministers agreed that they would work to enhance the powers of the regulators to ensure that they have full transparency particularly in the gas market, and to ensure that all behaviour is in the best interest of the market and consumer at all times. He said there was \u201cno silver bullet, no magic answers\u201d. The Australian Energy Market Operator will be given powers to procure and store gas in situations such as the one faced last week. He said:  There\u2019s storage facilities around the country. We agreed to work to give AEMO that power and to give them that power expeditiously. Again, that won\u2019t work today, but it will give us the capacity and the tools necessary to manage this crisis going forward. And to avoid crises like this into the future.       8.41am    Albanese vows to review low voter turnout in NT at last election The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has promised to review the Northern Territory\u2019s low voter turnout at the last election, AAP reports. Albanese blamed the former Coalition government, saying it had restricted the electoral commission from enrolling voters in the territory\u2019s two seats. \u201cThere was a deliberate policy of the former government to restrict people voting in the territory,\u201d he told reporters in Darwin on Wednesday. \u201cThey ripped resources out of the electoral commission.\u201d Just 66.79% of eligible voters cast a ballot in the seat of Lingiari, which covers most of the territory, at the 21 May election.  The voter turnout was higher in Darwin, with the urban seat of Solomon recording a 79.48% turnout of eligible voters. However, it was still well below the national average of 89.20% according to data from the Australian Electoral Commission. Albanese said the former coalition government \u201crestricted\u201d the number of AEC workers enrolling voters. \u201cIt was an outrage what occurred and then there was a lack of resources to enable people to vote. That was a part of the former government\u2019s design,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was straight out of the right-wing Republican playbook. \u201cMy government will look at what we can do to make sure that every Australian, every Australian, no matter where they live, no matter who they are, have equal right to be on the role and equal right to vote.\u201d The AEC has previously been accused of excluding some Indigenous Territorians from the electoral process because it won\u2019t automatically enrol people without a postal address, saying it can\u2019t send a written notice to them. The policy affects residents in remote Indigenous communities where homes don\u2019t have mailboxes and most residents rely on a central postal address. The AEC estimates 85.8% of the NT\u2019s eligible population are enrolled to vote.  Updated at 8.52am BST    8.36am    The energy ministers\u2019 meeting has run a bit over time.   Some reaction, though, from participants include, the vibe of the meeting was \u201cvery different\u201d, and \u201cvery collegiate\u201d, and \u201ca huge change of tone\u201d. The comparison is with the previous very irregular and infrequent meetings when Angus Taylor was the energy minister (and for reducing emissions and industry).     8.24am    New immigration minister \u2018being briefed\u2019 on options for Murugappan family The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, says he is thinking about how to resolve the Murugappan family\u2019s plight. They\u2019ve been put on bridging visas which allowed them to return to Biloela, but that is not permanent. Giles - who has the power to determine the next stage - says he is \u201cbeing briefed on the options available\u201d to allow the family to rebuild their lives in Biloela and will make a decision as soon as possible.   Updated at 8.36am BST    8.06am    Labour shortage and biosecurity among priorities for new agriculture minister The new agriculture minister has outlined the labour shortage, biosecurity and \u201cskyrocketing\u201d input prices as short-term priorities in his new portfolio, AAP reports. In his first major address as minister Murray Watt told a horticulture conference in Brisbane that climate change, sustainability and improving agriculture\u2019s value were his longer-term concerns. \u201cI already can see that workforce, biosecurity and input costs are probably the three most serious short term challenges ... We\u2019re onto it ... and I\u2019m up for any ideas,\u201d Senator Watt said on Wednesday. He said he recognised farmers are on the front line of climate change and can take advantage of opportunities in agriculture \u201cto make a buck out of making adjustments to deal with climate change\u201d. He told more than 1000 producers while he\u2019s not a farmer, \u201cfarming is in my blood\u201d and his family had a long connection with agriculture. \u201cI\u2019d like to think myself as someone who is as comfortable in the city as I am in the country,\u201d he said. The Queensland senator told the packed audience he realised the current labour shortage was a huge concern for the horticulture industry. \u201cIt\u2019s arguably the single biggest challenge facing hort in particular in our country at the moment,\u201d he said. Prior to the election. Labor committed to dumping the coalition\u2019s \u201cagriculture visa\u201d in favour of expanding the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme. Watt said feedback from stakeholders had been that the expansion of PALM is welcome but more is needed to attract skilled and semi-skilled workers to agriculture. \u201cI\u2019ll be frank with you. There\u2019s more that we could be doing around that as the new government ... to solve those challenges,\u201d he said. He wants to prioritise the training and employing of Australians in agriculture. \u201cI am very much open to discussion with the industry about what else we can do around skilled migration in particular to meet some of the challenges that we have,\u201d he said.  Updated at 8.14am BST    7.50am    Clean energy makes up more than a third of national market, report shows As the energy ministers huddle for their emergency/crisis/urgent (take your pick) but routine meeting this afternoon, Hugh Saddler, a well-regarded energy analyst, has released a monthly energy report with the Australian National University.Quite a few handy charts, including this one showing how the share of clean energy in the national electricity market (which should really be called the \u201ceastern Australian grid\u201d) has increased to more than a third.  It\u2019s notable, too, how renewables change over the season. Not surprisingly, there\u2019s not a lot of solar in winter.  Among the mainland states, South Australia is by far the most reliant on renewable energy.  The report also notes how rising gas prices and the falling reliability of coal-fired power has sent prices in the national market soaring.  \u201c[O]ver the 12 months from May 2021 to May 2022, monthly median spot wholesale prices increased by over five times in Victoria and South Australia, six times in Tasmania and New South Wales, and seven times in Queensland,\u201d the report said. \u201cAverage prices rose steadily for the whole period up to March 2021 and have increased drastically since then.\u201dFinally, here\u2019s the chart showing the availability of coal plants in the NEM.  As the units age, they need more maintenance, and it probably won\u2019t be surprising to see the time offline increasing over time, particularly as the schedule closure date approaches. Next to shut will be AGL\u2019s Liddell power station in NSW\u2019s Hunter Valley. One of the 1680 megawatt plant\u2019s four units shut permanently in April, while a second unit had a \u201cmalfunction\u201d three weeks ago and is not expected to return to service until the second half of July. The whole plant remains scheduled for permanent closure next April.  Updated at 8.02am BST    7.38am   Stuart Roberts says Biloela family \u2018not deserving\u2019 of protection  The shadow assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, has spoken to Sky News about the Murugappan family\u2019s return to Biloela. Robert said:  [The family] were found not to be owed protection by every court in the land. So on what basis is Mr Albanese very proud of his decision to give them [permanent residency]? What advice did he receive? Or did he just, under weight of public opinion, decide to sweep aside every court judgment and make this decision? And what impact will have this on the people smugglers networks?  Noting here Robert said \u201cPR\u201d for permanent residency, but the family has only been given bridging visas so far. Robert said he \u201cunderstands compassion \u2013 we should have enormous compassion \u2013 our hands should be filled with grace\u201d but he was concerned the government may have made the decision without proper advice. Somehow, despite all the grace and compassion, Roberts settles on the formulation that \u201cevery court in the land\u201d found the family were \u201cnot deserving of protection\u201d \u2013 as if the fact it wasn\u2019t owed as a minimum legal obligation is the beginning and end of the moral conversation about whether residency should be granted. Robert was also asked if Peter Dutton\u2019s reshuffle had punished backers of Scott Morrison such as himself. He said:  No, Mr Dutton has made that very clear that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m joining Angus [Taylor] on the economic team as shadow assistant treasurer and shadow financial services minister, a role I\u2019ve held in government. I\u2019m looking forward to working with a great colleague, Angus, in that economic team. Peter and I are very close, as two of the most senior Queensland MPs in the state and we get on well.   Updated at 7.58am BST    7.33am   NAB last of big four banks to pass on RBA rate rise  The National Australia Bank has become the last of the big four to announce they are raising their variable home loan rates after the RBA cash rate decision.   Updated at 7.37am BST    7.27am    Karen Andrews suggests high court decision on citizenship-stripping power is a test for Labor The Coalition has responded to the high court ruling striking down the home affairs minister\u2019s powers to strip dual nationals of Australian citizenship for engaging in suspected terrorist activities. Remember, Labor members of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security warned these powers were likely unconstitutional before the Coalition passed them.A spokesperson for the shadow home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said:  The Coalition has never backed down from doing what is necessary to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism. How Labor responds to this will show if they can walk the walk or if they are all talk on national security.  So the high court overturning Andrews\u2019s decision to strip Delil Alexander of citizenship is a test for Labor?    Updated at 7.46am BST    7.17am   ANZ passes on RBA rate hike in full  ANZ has become the third of the big four banks to raise home loan rates by the full RBA increase of half a percentage point. In a statement, the bank said the increase will be effective from 17 June and applies to all its variable interest home loan rates. On a $450,000 loan balance, monthly repayments will increase by $115 a month, ANZ said. The bank said it was reviewing the rates it offers from savings accounts, which in general across the banks have not kept up with the RBA\u2019s increases, but will offer a new 2.25% rate for 11-month term deposits from next Monday. ANZ\u2019s head of retail banking for Australia Maile Carnegie said:   We know rate changes affect customers differently and some may be looking for support as they reorganise their household budgets, particularly if they haven\u2019t experienced many rate increases before.  With Westpac, CBA and now ANZ having jacked up rates, all eyes are now on NAB.  Updated at 7.21am BST    7.13am    Labor to bring forward bill to allow territories to pass assisted dying laws, minister says  The new local government and territories minister, Kristy McBain, is on ABC Afternoon Briefing and has been asked about whether the Albanese government will give the ACT and NT the power to pass assisted dying laws, through the repeal of laws that restricted territory rights. She says she is looking forward to working with an expanded crossbench to bring forward a private member\u2019s bill or private senator\u2019s bill to repeal the laws. She said she has had initial discussions with ACT chief minister Andrew Barr and is hoping to have a discussion with NT chief minister Natasha Fyles. When it comes to a vote, she says it will be a conscience vote for Labor:  But when that allows territories to make decisions which may be against the faith of some of our members, you can see how they end up conflicted, and that\u2019s why if that private or private member\u2019s or senator\u2019s bill comes forward the Labor party would allow a conscience vote so it doesn\u2019t go against somebody\u2019s personal, religious or cultural beliefs.  She says she isn\u2019t sure of what the numbers in either chamber would be like but given the number of states that have already passed voluntary assisted dying laws she expects there would be enough to pass the law. McBain says she would vote in favour of the bill:  My mum worked in aged care for the last 15 years of her career and I\u2019ve had grandparents who have had terminal illnesses who have had to go through probably a difficult end to their lives and I think at the end of your life when you have a terminal illness you should be able to make a decision about when that ends for you.    Updated at 7.29am BST    7.00am   Dfat to get more resources to process passport applications  The assistant foreign affairs minister, Tim Watts, says the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be \u201curgently increasing numbers of processing and call centre staff as quickly as staff can be recruited and trained\u201d to deal with the delays in passport applications. There will be 35 call centre staff added this week, another 35 next week, and a minimum of 250 additional staff added over the next six weeks, Watts said. He said:  Before the pandemic, there were around 7,000-9,000 applications per day. Recently, that has increased to around 10,000-12,000 per day, with many applications that weren\u2019t lodged during the pandemic being lodged now. Yesterday, the number of applications reached a daily record of 16,417. This problem was predictable and is the result of the previous government dropping the ball and failing to properly plan for the surge in passport applications when borders re-opened. It shouldn\u2019t be Australians who suffer the consequences of these failures. While it will take some time to get back on track, we will continue to work with DFAT to make sure the required resources are delivered.  I urge Australians who are preparing to travel again to check the latest travel advice on Smartraveller.     Updated at 7.17am BST    6.50am    Labor warned over religious discrimination bill The peak body advocating for LGBTQI+ people has urged the federal government to strengthen protections for the community when it introduces laws to guarantee religious freedom, AAP reports. It comes after attorney general Mark Dreyfus told the ABC on Wednesday that draft legislation will be brought to parliament, but did not give a timeframe. \u201cAt its core, there is ... an appropriate structure of anti discrimination law, bringing in a prohibition on discriminating against people on the grounds of their religious belief,\u201d he said. Equality Australia\u2019s chief executive Anna Brown warned Labor against repeating the same \u201cmistakes\u201d of the Morrison government, which she said would have \u201cwound back protections\u201d for LGBTQIA people. The group says the government in its first 100 days should remove \u201coutdated\u201d exemptions it says are used by religious schools against gay teachers and students. \u201cLabor must first act swiftly to fill gaps in protection for LGBTQ+ students and teachers in religious schools and extend those same protections to all staff working in any faith-based organisations, and LGBTQ+ people accessing services from religious providers,\u201d Brown said.   Updated at 6.59am BST    6.38am   CommBank passes on RBA rate rise in full  The Commonwealth Bank has become the second bank to pass on the RBA rate increase in full, after Westpac. The CBA increase will come into effect in just over a week.   Updated at 6.43am BST    6.33am    Energy ministers to discuss supply shortages and soaring prices Energy ministers gather at the top of the hour for their first conference (albeit on video) since the new federal government took office. It\u2019s fair to say this time last week was a bit of scramble to secure energy supplies, particularly for gas. This afternoon, meanwhile, things are a bit more settled, with Queensland\u2019s wholesale prices bouncing around a bit but were recently at zero cost:  We look here at some of the key issues on the agenda of today\u2019s meeting, including the case for a domestic gas reservation (likely to be promoted by Victoria), and also the Energy Security Board\u2019s update on post-2025 market designs.  The ESB\u2019s presentation will likely discussion about a potential \u201ccapacity market\u201d, for which new federal climate and energy minister Chris Bowen set some key tests last October.  Bowen, though, has made a point since being sworn a week ago that he\u2019s not in favour of \u201cad hocery\u201d or \u201cknee-jerk responses\u201d. Let\u2019s see whether the market avoids the types of spasms (think blackouts) that might prompt such a move.   Updated at 7.31am BST    6.26am   Free solar panels for 30,000 NSW homes under state scheme  Thirty thousand NSW homes will receive free solar panel systems or be able to upgrade their appliances to energy-saving models in a bid to tackle rising energy prices, AAP reports. About one million low income earners in NSW, including concession, health care and DVA Gold Card holders, are already eligible for a scheme that provides $285 rebates on their annual power bills. Under the state government\u2019s new $128m \u201cenergy bill buster\u201d scheme, they will now be able to apply to trade in their rebates for a solar system to be installed at their homes. The government says solar power will save consumers $600 on power bills annually. People who can\u2019t have solar panels installed, such as those living in apartments, can instead swap the rebates for up to $4,000 to upgrade their appliances. \u201cThis energy bill buster package is all about sending (Russian president Vladimir) Putin\u2019s power prices packing,\u201d NSW treasurer Matt Kean told reporters on Wednesday. There were a number of factors driving up the cost of power in the state, and the war in Ukraine was a significant factor in driving up gas prices, he said.  Unscheduled outages at coal-fired power plants, along with the rise in gas prices, meant there was no cheaper alternative fuel source to fill the gap.  Premier Dominic Perrottet said the opportunity to invest in green technology would ease the pressure on household power bills, while also being good for the environment.  \u201cWe want to use the NSW budget to help families budgets and set up a brighter future for the people of our state.\u201d The scheme will initially be rolled out to 30,000 households, and further funding of the scheme will be considered depending on the uptake. The Labor party said the government had failed to meet its promises on solar batteries made in the lead up to the last state election, creating a shortfall of more than 19,600 batteries.    Updated at 6.38am BST    6.12am    Girl dies after allegedly falling from moving vehicle in NT A seven-year-old girl has died after she allegedly fell from a moving vehicle in a remote part of central Australia, AAP reports. The girl was travelling with her father about 4pm on Sunday near Harts Range, northeast of Alice Springs, when the incident occurred, Northern Territory police said. \u201cDuring the journey it is alleged she fell from the moving vehicle suffering serious head injuries,\u201d a police spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The girl was flown to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for Women and Children where she died from her injuries on Monday. Major crash detectives have travelled to the area to investigate. The town of Harts Range and the neighbouring Indigenous community of Atitjere are located 215km from Alice Springs at the base of the Harts Ranges.  Updated at 6.32am BST    5.58am    United Airlines will fly direct from San Francisco to Brisbane International Airport three times a week from late October in a major aviation deal for the state. The Boeing 787 Dreamliners will offer around 40,000 international seats a year. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was the first time the airline would fly to Queensland.    The airline ... is the largest and longest-serving US carrier in the Australian market. This airline route is also of strategic importance for Queensland when it comes to growing our share of the international tourism market. San Francisco is a major hub for United with direct connectivity to 80 North American cities. By securing these flights, Queensland becomes an easy choice for thousands of visitors throughout the US.      5.44am   Chalmers: rising rates will put \u2018significant pressure\u2019 on federal budget  Just some more on treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 earlier comments on aiming to hand down his first budget on 25 October, via AAP. Chalmers told a conference hosted by Sky News and the Australian he expected interest rate rises would dampen activity in the economy while affecting house prices and savings. They would also disproportionately affect the lowest income earners, he told Australia\u2019s Economic Outlook 2022 conference on Wednesday. \u201cAll of this will flow through to the budget. They will put significant pressure on a budget that already has its share of difficulties, including a relatively significant structural deficit, and now with those higher borrowing costs,\u201d Chalmers said.  His comments came after the Reserve Bank of Australia raised the cash rate by a larger-than-expected 50 basis points at its monthly board meeting on Tuesday, and warned that further increases would be needed to contain inflation. Chalmers also warned there wouldn\u2019t be \u201cautomatic upgrades\u201d to the budget. \u201cCommodity prices are helping but some of the other upgrades are not necessarily eventuating,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got a lot of pressures that weren\u2019t in the budget that we inherited, like some of the ongoing costs with Covid-19.\u201d Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said budget repair is important, as this allowed the government to respond to Covid. \u201cBut we have got to do that in a way that\u2019s about growth,\u201d she told the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t think you cut your way out of this, you have got to grow your way out of this.\u201d  Updated at 6.49am BST    5.35am    Australian courts may not be able to enforce an order that Google pay John Barilaro more than $700,000 in defamation damages because of free speech protections in US law, legal academics say.      5.27am    Matt Kean says claims of political deal over NSW koala policy \u2018absolutely untrue\u2019 NSW treasurer Matt Kean has denied claims from an outgoing Liberal colleague that he did a political deal that she claims \u201cvirtually condemns NSW koalas to extinction\u201d, AAP reports. NSW Liberal MP Catherine Cusack posted a series of tweets on Tuesday allegedly showing her and former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian arguing over text message about the government\u2019s proposed koala policy in 2020. \u201cI am posting these messages to prove I had no knowledge of the disgusting deal @Matt_KeanMP did with the Nationals that virtually condemns NSW koalas to extinction,\u201d Cusack wrote in a follow up tweet. Kean, the former environment minister, says the claims are \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d. \u201cEveryone knows that I fought to protect koalas,\u201d he said on Wednesday, citing the $193m funding package for the endangered species he secured while environment minister.\u201d  \u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of public record that my relationship with (former NSW Nationals Leader) John Barilaro nearly broke the government over the stance I took to protect koalas.\u201d Cusack also said her requests to meet with Dominic Perrottet in recent months had been rebuffed, however the premier said the pair met on Wednesday morning. \u201cCatherine has some concerns in relation to bills and the like,\u201d the premier said. \u201cThat\u2019s only a natural thing and when people get into parliament they have different views on things and I think that\u2019s important.\u201d  The government spent four years developing its koala SEPP (State Environmental Planning Policy), and while trying to pass the legislation endured a bruising stoush that threatened to destroy the Liberal-National coalition. It was defeated when Cusack crossed the floor, telling the parliament the policy \u201chas zero to do with protecting koalas\u201d. The text messages appear to show a lengthy exchange with Berejiklian urging Cusack to support the bill. Berejiklian allegedly later texted that Ms Cusack\u2019s lack of support meant the koala protection policy had been quashed and later informed her she had lost her role as parliamentary secretary. Greens MP Cate Faehrmann is scheduled to introduce a Great Koala National Park bill into parliament on Wednesday. She urged the Labor Party to support the bill but tweeted \u201call indications are they won\u2019t vote for it\u201d.  Updated at 6.17am BST    5.21am    The new shadow minister in the NDIS policy area, Michael Sukkar has responded to the CEO\u2019s resignation by demanding communications or discussions minister Bill Shorten had about the CEO role be made public.      5.11am    Ukraine war should not distract Quad from focus on Indo-Pacific, Indian high commissioner says India\u2019s high commissioner to Australia says the Quad \u2013 which also includes the US and Japan \u2013 must remain focused on the Indo-Pacific rather than be distracted by the war in Ukraine. Manpreet Vohra, the high commissioner to Australia, also said he hoped the interim trade deal between Australia and India \u2013 which was agreed before the election \u2013 would be ratified by the Australian parliament in coming months. Speaking to reporters in Canberra, Vohra said India had no reason to doubt the new Australian government\u2019s commitment to the Quad. He said prime ministers Anthony Albanese and Narendra Modi had a \u201cvery warm, very productive\u201d meeting in Tokyo shortly after the new Australian government took office.  It\u2019s quite clear from even before the elections and our interactions with the Labor party, that there is very strong bipartisan support for further deepening the India-Australia relationship, to the support for the comprehensive strategic partnership and all the different pillars of that, all the new areas that we believe India and Australia can get together to improve things for themselves, as well as for the region. And that has been on display since the election of the new government.  India, which has had long-standing ties with Russia, has been the Quad partner most reluctant to condemn Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether it was a strength or weakness of the Quad that the grouping was able to accommodate those differences, Vohra said:  It\u2019s certainly a strength. I think the four Quad members are such good friends with each other, and collectively, that it allows you to, you know, understand differences that one might have in terms of policy positions, etc. So we explain, frankly, to them what we can do or cannot do, they do the same with us. And there is that understanding and appreciation of each other\u2019s constraints and abilities. And in any case, there is agreement by all four that the Quad cannot lose sight of the Indo-Pacific, which is its focus, and events in Europe, while they will have an impact, cannot distract us from our attention on the future of the Indo-Pacific region.   Vohra was speaking after an event marking the launch of the Australia-India Leadership Dialogue, to be held on 6 September in New Delhi. The dialogue will be co-chaired by Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and Australia India Institute chief executive Lisa Singh, who is a former Labor senator.   Updated at 5.29am BST    5.02am    Victorian transport company fined $490,000 after worker died in truck rollover A Victorian transport company has been slapped with $490,000 in fines after a worker died in a truck rollover in the state\u2019s southeast, AAP reports. The truck driver died while attempting to round a bend in a milk tanker at Leongatha in May 2018. An investigation into the company he worked for, Peter Stoitse Transport Pty Ltd, found it failed to give its drivers detailed information and training about how to drive the tankers, despite nine rollovers since 2009. An inspection at its Leongatha depot in July 2018 resulted in major defect notices for 80% of a fleet of prime movers and tanker trailers, meaning they had to be immediately taken off the road. In September 2018, the company did not notify WorkSafe about a separate truck rollover at Echuca. That incident left another driver hospitalised with a serious laceration. Peter Stoitse Transport pleaded guilty in the Latrobe Valley County Court on Wednesday to two charges of failing to provide and maintain a safe working environment, and one charge of failing to notify WorkSafe about an incident. It was hit with $490,000 in fines. The largest of $300,000 was for failing to provide a safe system of work. The company showed a clear disregard for its drivers\u2019 safety, WorkSafe health and safety executive Narelle Beer said:  Tragically, two workers have been killed in vehicle accidents so far this year and WorkSafe will continue to take strong enforcement action against those duty holders refusing to keep their workers safe on the road.

AAP reports the cost of living in the territory \u2013 the Consumer Price Index \u2013 jumped six per cent in the 12 months to December 2021, well above the national average of 3.5%, the NT\u2019s peak body for the social and community services sector said. \u201cTerritorians are doing it tough,\u201d NT Council of Social Service chief executive Deborah Di Natale said. \u201cWe need the commonwealth and NT government to recognise these increases for critical services like health, childcare and education, and for living costs such as housing, transport and food.\u201d  Darwin rents rose eight per cent compared to 0.4% nationally in the same 12-month period, according to the council\u2019s recently released annual cost of living report. Housing in Darwin - including utilities - also increased, up 15.9% compared to four per cent nationally. Darwin families were also hit at the petrol bowser, with automotive fuels rising 45.9% compared with 32.3% nationally. The increases were even more severe for people in remote communities, where the price of diesel is up to $2.75 per litre, according to Fuel Price Australia. Overall, it means Territorians living on low incomes or on income support payments are finding it tough to pay for everyday expenses. \u201cSignificant cost of living pressures have emerged or intensified for Territorians, and at an unsustainable and disproportionate rate in certain areas,\u201d Di Natale said in the report. \u201cThe implications of this for people\u2019s physical and mental health, and ability to participate in the workforce and in society is well known. This reality is preventable and should not be accepted.\u201d The council called on the federal government to increase social security payments, such as Jobseeker and the Remote Area Allowance, twice yearly. The council has also called on the NT government to extend concessions for electricity, driver\u2019s licences, prescription glasses, vehicle registration and bus fares.  Updated at 5.17am BST    4.30am   Tasmania set to raise minimum age of detention from 10 to 14  The Tasmanian government has announced it will raise the minimum age of detention from 10 to 14 as part of its overhaul of the youth justice system in Tasmania.  Minister for education, children and youth, Roger Jaensch said:  We know that detention does not support rehabilitation or reduce the likelihood of reoffending for younger children. Early exposure to a detention environment can also further traumatise young people, expose them to problem behaviours of older detainees and increase criminal networks. There will always be a need for secure detention as a last resort for a very small minority of young people who commit the most serious offences, and to ensure community safety.  This change will help ensure that the detention of young people in Tasmania is truly a last resort.  The powers for police to arrest, search and hold young people 10 and over will remain for the purposes of investigating crime.  Legislation will need to pass through parliament, which Jaensch said will be part of a suite of legislation overhauling the youth justice system, anticipated to occur near the end of 2024. Age of criminal responsibility is being considered through the national meeting of attorneys general, seeking national consistency. Change the Record welcomed the commitment, but said the age of criminal responsibility should also be raised to 14. Cheryl Axleby, co-chair of Change the Record said:   Children belong at home, in school and with their families \u2013 not in handcuffs, courtrooms or prison cells. It is a relief to hear the Tasmanian government commit to keeping tiny children out of prisons, but they must do more to protect and support our children in community and give them the opportunities they deserve to thrive. This announcement stops short of the reforms we need \u2013 not just to keep children out of prison cells, but to ensure children under 14 are never arrested, handcuffed or put in police lockup but are instead supported with therapeutic and age-appropriate services when they need our help.   Updated at 4.37am BST    4.24am    Consumer groups back government commitment to regulate buy now, pay later sector Consumer groups have welcomed the commitment by new financial services minister Stephen Jones, reported by Guardian Australia this morning, to regulate buy now, pay later (BNPL) services as credit. They\u2019re currently exempt from consumer protection rules due to a loophole in the law and consumer groups say a voluntary code set up by the industry has too many gaps. In a statement, Financial Counselling Australia, Choice, Anglicare Australia, the Consumer Action Law Centre (Calc) and the Financial Rights Legal Centre welcomed Jones\u2019s commitment. \u201cThis is fantastic news for consumers, giving them better protection and rights under the credit laws,\u201d said Fiona Guthrie, the CEO of Financial Counselling Australia. Alan Kirkland, the CEO of Choice, said:   Buy now, pay later is unregulated credit and is causing harm to consumers. We welcome closing this loophole as a priority for the new government. Governments in countries like the UK and New Zealand have recognised the need to protect people from these unregulated products. It is time for Australia to catch up.  Gerard Brody, the CEO of Calc, said:   The industry code has far too many gaps. It isn\u2019t mandatory and there are many BNPL companies that haven\u2019t signed up. There are only vague upfront assessment processes, that do not require the company to only provide loans that are affordable and suitable. Moreover, there is virtually no consequences for breaching the code \u2013 it does not contain sanctions or consumer rights equivalent to credit laws.

AAP reports the premier will visit local forestry sites and business leaders on Wednesday ahead of a community cabinet forum in Mount Gambier later in the day. That will give locals an opportunity to speak directly with cabinet ministers. On Thursday, there will be a formal cabinet meeting with Malinauskas to also visit the local TAFE college. \u201cThe Limestone Coast plays a vital role in the economic and social fabric of our state,\u201d the premier said.  The cabinet\u2019s trip to the southeast comes on the back of significant election promises from Labor which included $52.5m for the regional health system, $39m for a new technical college in Mount Gambier and $19m to support the state\u2019s forestry industry.

The prime minister was asked about Chinese company Landbridge Group\u2019s long-term lease over the port when he spoke with reporters in Darwin this morning. He said:  What I\u2019ve said is what I said prior to the election. And I will do what I said I would do on this and every other issue, which is we\u2019ll have a review of the circumstances of the port. The [Northern Territory] chief minister is conscious of the fact that we will do that. And we\u2019ll do that in an orderly way.   Let\u2019s step through the history of this contentious issue and where things landed during the previous term of parliament. The NT\u2019s then Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to Landbridge Group in 2015. Last year, the Morrison government announced a review of the arrangements at the Port of Darwin on national security grounds. For the record, we should add that Landbridge Group vowed to cooperate with that review while stating that it had struck the deal with the NT government \u201cin good faith\u201d.  On 1 April, then foreign minister Marise Payne dismissed a news report that Defence\u2019s review had found there were no national security grounds sufficient to recommend a government intervention to overturn the lease. She told Senate estimates the review was \u201cstill in process\u201d.  Basically, it sounds like Defence had completed its part of the review, but other national security agencies were also involved, and officially the review had never ended. During the election campaign, Albanese and his frontbenchers were highly critical of the lease arrangements. When asked on 26 April what a Labor government would do about the Port of Darwin, Albanese said it \u201cshould never have been sold to the Chinese\u201d. He said that decision was \u201cextraordinary\u201d because it was a strategic port, \u201cand it is something that I\u2019ve said we would examine if we were in government\u201d. Pressed on whether he would break the lease, then opposition leader Albanese told Radio 5AA:  Well, I\u2019ve said that we would examine those issues if we were, if we\u2019re successful, in May. There are issues that you would need to take advice on. Issues of sovereign risk and other issues that you need to take account of and they are not unimportant. But it is important that Australia is prepared to stand up for our national interest.  Given that the federal review never officially ended, it sounds like Australia\u2019s security agencies will pick up where they left off in the previous term of parliament.  Updated at 4.33am BST    4.06am    Striking public service workers rally outside NSW parliament over pay rise Thousands of striking public service workers have rallied outside NSW parliament to vent their displeasure over the government\u2019s promised 3% pay rise, AAP reports. Public Service Association (PSA) members ranging from prison officers, park rangers, school support staff, ServiceNSW workers and civilian police employees are striking for 24 hours. Union members marched up Macquarie Street in Sydney on Wednesday morning, but the crowd did not match the size of recent strikes by teachers and nurses. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping for a very good turnout,\u201d PSA general secretary Stewart Little said, adding he would love to see 30,000 members hit the streets in protest.  The strike comes after the PSA last week gave an ultimatum to the government to commit to a pay rise. Premier Dominic Perrottet on Monday announced the 2.5 % annual cap on public sector wage rises would be increased to 3% next financial year, with an additional 3.5% the following year, depending on productivity gains. PSA senior vice president Juliette Sizer told members a fair pay rise \u201cstarts at 5.2%\u201d, 0.1% above inflation. The government also announced frontline health staff would receive a $3,000 bonus in recognition of their work during the Covid-19 pandemic. Little said no one is more deserving of the bonus than health workers but it should include PSA members who work in the ministry of health. \u201cThe epidemiologists, the contact tracers ... stopping the pandemic overwhelming our community,\u201d he said. Teachers, prison officers and emergency service workers should also get the payment, he added. Unions have called for the wages cap to be raised further to at least reflect the rate of inflation, while some want it abolished altogether. Labor has also been pushing for changes to the bargaining process between unions and the government. Opposition leader Chris Minns has described it as \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d.    Perrottet said the wage rise was fair and responsible within the confines of the 21 June budget. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the public servants that are going through a challenging time, it\u2019s every person across NSW after coming through the pandemic,\u201d Perrottet said.

We need to bust a few myths. Some of the myths are that this country is running out of gas. It\u2019s not running out of gas. The problem is too much of what is being produced, certainly to the north of the country, is being exported overseas, and that\u2019s because of profits being made by the large producers.  She also flagged the potential \u201credesign\u201d of the so-called gas \u201ctrigger\u201d mechanism, which would force gas companies to supply more product domestically, but can currently only be activated from 1 January. Her comments come ahead of the \u201ccrisis meeting\u201d of Australia\u2019s energy ministers over the current power issues.   Updated at 4.14am BST    3.50am    Daily Mail\u2019s citing of student\u2019s gender and sexuality found to breach press code The Daily Mail has removed photos and references to a youth worker\u2019s gender identity and sexuality in an article after the article was found to be in breach of the Press Council code. The report referenced that the student is non-binary and queer in a story critical of an article they had written in a the Meanjin magazine regarding the Brereton report on alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. A complaint, not from the subject of the article, to the Press Council raised concerns that prominent references to the student\u2019s sexual orientation and gender identity were not relevant to the article. The Press Council found that in prominently referring to the student\u2019s sexual orientation and gender identity the Daily Mail failed to take reasonable steps to avoid contributing to substantial prejudice and that there was not sufficient public interest justifying doing so.  The council said it welcomed the amendment of the article to remove the photos and references.

Updated at 3.41am BST    3.29am    Dreyfus says \u2018no threat\u2019 to Australia after high court ruling on terrorism laws The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has released a statement in response to the Delil Alexander ruling in the high court. To recap, the high court has ruled powers used by the former home affairs minister to cancel the Australian citizenship of a dual national suspected of terrorist activities are unconstitutional. Dreyfus said:  The government notes the decision of the High Court of Australia in Alexander v Minister for Home Affairs [2022]. The government will examine the judgment and its implications in detail. It is important to note that there is no threat to Australia as a result of today\u2019s decision. The Australian government has a range of measures available to manage the risk posed to Australians by individuals offshore including the Temporary Exclusion Order regime which can prohibit an individual returning to Australia for up to two years.

Police have declared a crime scene and preliminary examinations indicate the remains are human. They will be sent for further scientific and forensic analysis including establishing gender.  Updated at 3.52am BST    3.17am   Court overturns order for Nine to hand over program drafts  The New South Wales court of appeal has thrown out an extraordinary order requiring Nine Entertainment to hand over copies of a 60 Minutes program about the Double Bay cosmetic surgeon Joseph Ajaka before it was broadcast. Last month Ajaka won a court order at the 11th hour preventing the broadcast, and the publication of articles in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age.  But the appeals court has ruled the order was a mistake and should be set aside because there was \u201cno such power, jurisdiction or authority\u201d for \u201cpreliminary discovery against a party or parties who were already defendants to proceedings\u201d. The court ruled that the orders \u201cmade by Justice Rothman on the afternoon of 13th May 2022 were not sustained by any jurisdiction in the court. Those orders must therefore be set aside\u201d. Nine has been approached for comment.  Updated at 4.20am BST    3.13am    High court says Love and Thoms precedent did not retrospectively apply to Aboriginal man\u2019s detention case We\u2019ve got a bit more detail on the case of Aboriginal man Brendan Thoms, after the high court found his detention by immigration authorities was lawful.  The judges unanimously followed a precedent that section 189 of the Migration Act can validly authorise detention of people who are \u201creasonably suspected of being unlawful non-citizens\u201d. The reasonableness is judged at the time of the detention.  The judges said the high court\u2019s prior decision in the 2020 case of Love and Thoms that Aboriginal could not be \u201calien\u201d to Australia did not retrospectively make that suspicion unreasonable. Thoms was detained because he was a New Zealand citizen whose Australian visa had been cancelled, which were objective facts that provided reasonable grounds for his detention.  Thoms\u2019s lawyer, Claire Gibbs, said:  Our client Brendan Thoms is very disappointed with this outcome. He spent more than 500 nights locked up in immigration detention. He deserves justice and accountability for the way he was treated and the ongoing harm it has caused.  The federal government now has an important opportunity to ensure that the findings of the historic Love Thoms case are upheld and followed, so that no First Australians will ever again be declared aliens and threatened with deportation.  The Morrison government appealed against the release of an Aboriginal non-citizen (Montgomery) to try to overturn the original Love and Thoms decision, a bid to restore commonwealth power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens. The Albanese Labor government is yet to say if they will pull the case.

Police say around 4pm on Sunday a seven-year-old girl was travelling with her father and several others in a vehicle around 25km east of Harts Range. Police allege during the journey she fell from the moving vehicle, suffering serious head injuries. The girl was taken to the Harts Range clinic and later the Royal Adelaide hospital for women and children but died from her injuries. Major crash investigation unit detectives travelled to the area to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident. Investigations continue.

In a statement, Wong also called on the UN Security Council to \u201crespond decisively to North Korea\u2019s continued violation of its legally binding resolutions\u201d. She said Australia would \u201ccontinue to strictly enforce\u201d those resolutions and would \u201cencourage all countries to do likewise\u201d. She signalled that Australia would keep its autonomous sanctions against North Korea under review. Wong said:  Australia strongly condemns North Korea\u2019s launch of eight ballistic missiles this week \u2013 which violates multiple UN Security Council resolutions and undermines the global non-proliferation regime. The test on 5 June is the latest demonstration of the regime\u2019s reckless and destabilising behaviour. North Korea has launched a total of 31 ballistic missiles so far this year, including six intercontinental ballistic missiles. Its apparent preparations to undertake a nuclear test are likewise gravely concerning and a threat to the peace and security of our region. Australia calls on the Security Council to respond decisively to North Korea\u2019s continued violation of its legally binding resolutions. We further urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and return to meaningful dialogue with the United States and the Republic of Korea. Permanent peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula can only be achieved through dialogue.

Asked what drew the government agency to the attention of the unit, she said police were in \u201cearly stages of the investigation\u201d and were \u201clooking into all lines of enquiry\u201d.   At this stage we\u2019ve got two females who are deceased and we have no further information at this stage. We don\u2019t know the cause of death. We\u2019ll know more tomorrow once we\u2019ve had the post-mortem completed. The bodies have been there for some time. However I can\u2019t tell you how long. That will be a question for the coroner ... it\u2019s a very tragic scene when we go to any deceased persons, let alone two sisters who are deceased and unfortunately, at this stage, we don\u2019t know why.   Updated at 2.30am BST    2.17am   Bodies of two women discovered in a NSW unit, police say  New South Wales police are speaking now about the discovery of two bodies at a unit in Canterbury. The women haven\u2019t been formally identified but are believed to be 23 and 24 years old. They were located in their separate bedrooms.   About 9:30am, police attended an apartment in Canterbury Road, Canterbury, following reports that a body had been located by another government agency. Upon entering the premises, police located the bodies of two females.  A crime scene was established, and has been examined by specialist crime scene officers. There was no obvious signs of forced entry to the detectives from Burwood police area command and the homicide squad are investigating the circumstances under Strike Force Walbird. Detectives are still examining the crime scene.  Asked if police were investigating a murder, officer Claudia Allcroft said police were still in the \u201cinfancy\u201d of the investigation but the circumstances were suspicious and more would be known after a post-mortem examination is conducted tomorrow.  Updated at 2.21am BST    2.12am    NSW public servants walk off the job demanding pay rise About 30,000 public servants in New South Wales are walking off the job today demanding pay rises keep up with rising inflation.   It comes after the Public Service Association (PSA) union\u2019s demands of a 5.4% pay rise weren\u2019t met by the start of the week. Instead, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, offered a pay rise of 3%, with another 0.5% increase to the public service annual pay cap likely the following year. He also announced a one-off bonus of $3,000 for healthcare workers.  Union representatives said this amounted to a pay cut when Australia\u2019s inflation rate was factored in.  The PSA NSW general secretary, Stewart Little, said:  This offer is pure politics. Moving half a per cent and playing silly games with one-off bonuses for certain workers. It\u2019s a shameless attempt at dividing workers against each other.

Updated at 2.02am BST    1.51am    High court releases details of citizenship law invalidation The high court has released a summary of its decision invalidating laws that allowed the home affairs minister to strip someone of citizenship for repudiating their allegiance to Australia by engaging in proscribed conduct, such as foreign incursions of alleged terrorist recruitment. First, some facts about the plaintiff, Delil Alexander:  The plaintiff was born in Australia and acquired Australian citizenship by birth. He also acquired, and still holds, Turkish citizenship by descent. In April 2013, the plaintiff departed Australia for Turkey and, at some point, travelled into Syria. A qualified security assessment (QSA) provided by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to the minister in June 2021 stated that the plaintiff had joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which was a designated \u2018terrorist organisation\u2019, by August 2013, and that he had likely engaged in foreign incursions and recruitment by entering or remaining in al-Raqqa Province in Syria, a \u2018declared area\u2019, on or after 5 December 2014.  In July 2021, the minister made a determination pursuant to section 36B of the Citizenship Act, relying in part on the information provided in the QSA, that the plaintiff ceased to be an Australian citizen. The determination stated that the minister was satisfied that: the plaintiff had engaged in foreign incursions while outside Australia, which demonstrated a repudiation of his allegiance to Australia; that it would be contrary to the public interest for him to remain an Australian citizen; and that he would not become stateless by reason of the determination.  The law was judged invalid because some in the majority found in effect it amounted to retribution for conduct deemed so reprehensible as to be incompatible with the shared values of the Australian community because it deprived the plaintiff of his entitlement to enter and live at liberty in Australia.  Only courts can judge and punish criminal guilt, so the law was invalid.  Updated at 1.57am BST    1.44am    Daniel Andrews says Victoria can\u2019t \u201cgo it alone\u201d on gas reserve scheme This is the Victorian premier\u2019s take ahead of this afternoon\u2019s meeting on energy:   Meanwhile, the leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, is still yelling to the abyss about nuclear power:  Here is some analysis on the nuclear power question from climate and environment editor, Adam Morton:   Updated at 1.48am BST    1.38am    Energy ministers meet to discuss power price spikes State and federal energy ministers are holding a video conference late this afternoon, which is timely given the strain in the east coast markets lately, and the soaring wholesale prices.  The Australian Energy Market Operator yesterday lifted its imposed gas price caps for the Sydney and Brisbane markets that had been imposed after the exit of Weston Energy from the market triggered the first use of the \u201cretailer of last resort mechanism\u201d in about six years.  However, by another measure, Sydney\u2019s cumulative price threshold has been exceeded so the price cap of $40 a gigajoule remains. By the same approach, Victoria\u2019s wholesale gas prices remain at $40/GJ after the state hit the threshold on 30 May. There\u2019s a bit of discussion this morning around \u201cif only we\u2019d reserved some domestic gas when we opened up eastern Australia to global prices a decade ago\u201d. (Both the Coalition and Labor share the blame for waiving that decision through when it was clear local consumers would cop higher gas prices.) Western Australia has a 15% reservation policy and lower power prices. Today\u2019s meeting is not an emergency one although it does have some urgent issues to deal with. It\u2019s not expected to produce a major outcome although the current price spikes will be addressed. It will discuss the progress towards a \u201ccapacity market\u201d. This seems to be a key issue to watch in the coming years with the main question being, if we do have standby power plants what form will they take? WA (again!) has one, as do many markets overseas. Will ageing coal plants be kept going a bit longer, or as some states want, only new capacity so that we don\u2019t hinder the transition towards decarbonisation. An issue to keep an eye on.  Updated at 1.43am BST    1.30am   National Disability Insurance Agency boss resigns  The chief executive of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), Martin Hoffman, has resigned after continued speculation about his future. Hoffman, who took on the role in November 2019, was heavily criticised during his term by the new minister, Bill Shorten, who accused the NDIA leadership of losing the trust of the disability community.  Before the election, Shorten told Guardian Australia that \u201cyou have to question the whole leadership of the NDIS in the last few years\u201d and singled out Hoffman, as well as former chair Helen Nugent, blaming them for the abandoned \u201cindependent assessments\u201d proposal that riled advocates. Shorten had this week batted away questions about Hoffman\u2019s future.  The NDIA chair, Denis Napthine, said:  During Martin\u2019s leadership the NDIS completed the full transition from the old systems \u2013 and grew dramatically with now more than 520,000 participants benefiting from the scheme. He has also overseen significant participant experience improvements, with an emphasis on digital investment that will deliver further improvements in future. He led the agency with passion, grace and commitment, including managing through the impacts of the Covid pandemic.   Hoffman said:   It has been an absolute privilege to have served in this role for the last three years. I wish the scheme, and its participants, families, carers and providers all the very best for the future. I thank the amazing staff of the agency for their dedication and support.  Hoffman faced significant pressure over the independent assessments saga, during which several damaging internal leaks pointed to dissatisfaction with the agency\u2019s attempts to clamp down on increasing costs.  More recently the agency has been accused of wasteful spending on private lawyers to battle NDIS participants in the courts, while Hoffman himself apologised after Guardian Australia revealed his staff had compiled an \u201cintelligence report\u201d of a woman\u2019s social media posts as it fought unsuccessfully to deny her support.  Shorten has also been critical of the appointment of Napthine, a former Victorian Liberal premier, who was appointed by the Coalition earlier this year. Hoffman will leave the role on 2 July, with the deputy, Lisa Studdart, to serve in the position while a replacement is found.  Shorten has released a statement:   Updated at 2.03am BST    1.27am   Adam Bandt tests positive for Covid-19  The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has tested positive for Covid.  In a statement, he said:  It\u2019s finally caught up with me \u2013 I have returned a positive result for Covid-19. I\u2019ve got mild symptoms and will be isolating at home in Melbourne for the next seven days. I will continue some duties remotely, while also taking time to rest and recover. I send my sincerest thanks to all the nurses and healthcare workers who are about to enter another winter of flu and Covid cases \u2013 you deserve a pay rise.   Updated at 1.29am BST    1.24am   NT records 254 new Covid cases  The Northern Territory government has released today\u2019s Covid update. There have been 254 new cases reported and no further deaths. There were 121 cases recorded in the Top End, 55 in central Australia, 10 in East Arnhem, 19 in the Big Rivers region, three in the Barkly region and 46 are under investigation. There are 14 people being treated in hospital with the virus and none in ICU.    Updated at 1.27am BST    1.20am   Aboriginal non-citizen fails in unlawful detention claim  The high court has ruled that the detention of an Aboriginal non-citizen was not unlawful, because he was detained before a landmark decision that found they were beyond the reach of the aliens power. In February 2020, the high court ruled that Aboriginal Australians cannot be aliens, and therefore cannot be deported, a decision the commonwealth is currently attempting to overturn. Brendan Thoms, one of the original plaintiffs, brought a separate case arguing that his detention from September 2018 to February 2020 was unlawful, a move that could expose the commonwealth to compensation claims by multiple people who were released after the decision. On Wednesday the high court unanimously ruled that Thoms detention in that time was not unlawful.  Updated at 1.23am BST    1.16am   Stripping dual nationals of citizenship unlawful, high court rules  The high court has ruled that laws allowing dual nationals to be stripped of their Australian citizenship for suspected terrorist activities are unconstitutional. The laws were challenged by lawyers acting for Delil Alexander, a Turkish Australian man imprisoned in Syria whose citizenship was revoked in July 2021. On Wednesday the high court ruled that the home affairs minister\u2019s powers were invalid because they involved the exercise of an \u201cexclusive judicial function\u201d, that is, punishing criminal guilt. The court ordered that Alexander is an Australian citizen and the law purportedly stripping him of it is invalid.  Updated at 1.22am BST    1.13am    Penny Wong speaks with US secretary of state Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Penny Wong, continues her whirlwind entry into global diplomacy, holding a phone call with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on the way back from her visit to Indonesia with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. A readout of the call, from Blinken\u2019s office, said the pair spoke about \u201cour ongoing coordination on regional issues\u201d and the upcoming G20 meetings in Bali \u2013 which Albanese confirmed this week he would be attending, after questions over whether he would visit considering the participation of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Blinken\u2019s office said:  Secretary Blinken and foreign minister Wong also discussed our collective efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjust war of choice against Ukraine, including in multilateral institutions and bodies. The secretary and foreign minister reviewed the foreign minister\u2019s recent visits to Indonesia, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, and the secretary reaffirmed the United States commitment to strengthening economic opportunity, resiliency, and freedom across the Indo-Pacific through open and transparent work with partners and allies in the region.

He replies:  We need to do exactly what we said we would do which is to have a plan to ensure that we move to 82% renewables by 2030 as part of the national energy market. A 42% reduction. But we\u2019ll put in place the measures. We need to, as soon as possible, make sure that we fix transmission, it\u2019s the low-hanging fruit. It\u2019s critical and we\u2019ll do what we can to do that.

Anthony Albanese is pleased:  Isn\u2019t that good? Do you feel good about that? I sure do. Every Australian should.  What about other families or other situations? Albanese returns to the family:  The Bilo family were loved and wanted by their local community. This guy, Nades, worked at local meatworks. We import people to work in meatworks because we can\u2019t find enough workers. And here we grab this family in the middle of the night, took them down to Melbourne. Then took them to Christmas Island. Then they\u2019ve ended up in Perth after these little girls who were born in Australia got not just mental health issues, but physical health issues as well.  I\u2019m very proud we\u2019ve brought this family home. I\u2019m very proud. And the community will be as well. No people should be treated in that way, and I must say this as well. The cost, the cost to the Australian taxpayers is in the double figures of millions of dollars from this.   Updated at 1.06am BST    12.56am    Coal still part of Australia\u2019s energy mix, PM says Reporter:  Considering the way that the grid is now, though, are you open to using coal to make up for the gas shortfalls and supply-and-demand problems now?  Anthony Albanese:  Coal is a part of our mix right now.  The NT chief minister follows. She says it\u2019s a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d to work with a Labor government that believes in climate change and the need to shift to renewables on projects like the sun cable.  Albanese says he\u2019s had discussions with billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and others about how to maximise the cable\u2019s input.  Updated at 1.05am BST    12.54am    PM cites budget deficit Anthony Albanese dodges whether cabinet would consider vouchers for electricity prices and winter handouts for low-income households before the October budget, but reiterates that the government is $1tn in debt:  The former government has left us with $1tn of debt. There are measures, some measures are in place to alleviate some cost-of-living pressures and they\u2019re in place ... but we will, of course, always consider what can be done. But there is a fiscal context here.   Updated at 1.04am BST    12.52am    Energy grid must be made fit for purpose, Albanese says Reporter:  How uncomfortable is it for you as a new leader promising an extra push towards renewable energy, when you\u2019re in a situation where there\u2019s a fall back on coal-fired production with electricity?  Anthony Albanese:  Not at all. One of the problems that has occurred here is a failure of investment. Because the former government had 22 energy policies, and didn\u2019t land one. So, you haven\u2019t had the orderly investment that is needed ... You don\u2019t have a grid that\u2019s fit for purpose in the 21st century. That\u2019s why in my first budget reply, we had two big measures \u2013 childcare ... but rewiring the nation \u2013 to fix the energy grid based upon the Australian Energy Market Operator\u2019s integrated systems plan ... If you had a grid that was fit for purpose, where renewables were being plugged into the grid, just as households know that if you\u2019ve got solar panels on your roof, they\u2019re lowering your power bills. If that was across the economy for households and businesses with a grid that was fit for purpose, you would have a real alleviation on pressures that are in place right now.   Updated at 1.01am BST    12.50am    Energy market pressures have built up over nine years, PM says Anthony Albanese reminds journalists his government was just sworn in and says pressures on the energy market are a hangover from the previous government:  We\u2019ve been in government now for just a little bit over two weeks. These pressures have built up over nine years. And this, the former government, had a policy of deliberately keeping wages low at a time when cost of living and the price of everything was going up. My government does not have that policy. My government has a policy of doing what we can to assist cost-of-living pressures. At the same time, we\u2019re conscious of the fact that we\u2019re being left with $1tn of debt with not much to show for it.   Updated at 12.59am BST    12.48am    \u2018My government understands the pressure that working families are under\u2019 The PM is asked about what the government will do in the short term to ease cost-of-living pains in the wake of interest rate hikes announced by the RBA yesterday. He acknowledges the RBA decision will be \u201ca blow\u201d for families but it wasn\u2019t unexpected. He then reiterates the government\u2019s long-term strategies of childcare and renewable energy reform:  That doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t hurt people. We know that people are suffering from a cost-of-living crisis. With everything going up except for their wages. We have a plan to alleviate cost-of-living pressures by taking measures on childcare, by taking measures on electricity prices, which will have an impact.  Not immediately. It takes time to flow that through, but also by our position on wages, which is to have a plan to lift wages. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll have an employment summit coming through ... my government understands the pressure that working families are under and we\u2019ll be doing what we can to alleviate those pressures going forward.   Updated at 1.08am BST    12.45am    Jet interception occurred in international air space, PM stresses The prime minister is asked about accusations from the Chinese government that an Australian RAAF plane came near the airspace of the disputed Paracel Islands, known as Xisha in China, when it was intercepted by a Chinese jet. He replies:  This incident occurred in international air space. Full stop.   Updated at 12.55am BST    12.42am    Voice to parliament \u2018simply good manners\u2019, PM says Now to questions. Anthony Albanese is asked if he is confident he will have bipartisan support to implement the Uluru statement from the heart:  I\u2019m very hopeful that that will occur ... I want to work to bring people together. And what we know is that this will be just like the apology to stolen generations.  When it happens, people will wonder why it hadn\u2019t happened earlier. And that\u2019s what I want to do. This is just simply good manners in order to ask First Nations people what their view is when issues affect them. Whether it be their education, their health. Sometimes it\u2019s put as if this is just symbolic, and there\u2019s a difference between practical reconciliation and symbolism. The two are connected. If you don\u2019t give respect to people, then you won\u2019t be able to close the gap in health, in education, in housing, in life expectancy. In all of these issues in which we need to do that practical work. And I am up for reaching out and embracing as many people as possible, but I\u2019m absolutely committed to advancing this as well.    Updated at 12.51am BST    12.40am    NT chief minister celebrates \u2018new frontier\u2019 and thanks traditional owners  Natasha Fyles is up. She says it\u2019s \u201cwonderful\u201d to have the newly elected PM in the NT:  Showing to Territorians that he dares about more than the east coast. Here in the territory, and also our strong representation from my federal parliamentary colleagues, and I, too, acknowledge the Larrakia people and pay my respects.  It was amazing to be in east Arnhem Land last week looking at Nasa infrastructure on territory soil. I acknowledge the Gumatj and the work that they have done with ELA to get this project off the ground. We have backed it since its inception and it is showing that the Northern Territory is a key part of the future, particularly for investors in this new frontier. So it\u2019s an exciting project.   Updated at 12.52am BST    12.38am    Albanese hails Nasa rocket launches Anthony Albanese says the Nasa rockets, to be launched into space from the NT, will be an \u201cexciting project\u201d that will send a message to Australians of how important science is:  Australia\u2019s contribution to the space industry does date back to the 1950s. As a nation, we have to build on that legacy, and it\u2019s terrific to be here in Darwin today to declare Equatorial Launch Australia and Nasa go for launch right here in the Northern Territory.  The Australian government has granted regulatory approval for ELA to launch three scientific suborbital launches on behalf of Nasa between June 26 and July 12 at the Arnhem Space Centre. These three launches are important, they\u2019re for universities to do scientific research. These rockets will go some 250km north into ... well, up into the sky, to collect data on physics of the sun and its relationship with the Earth. We want the next generation to look at Stem as part of Australia\u2019s future and this is why this is an important project ... the idea Nasa is involved in Australia should be something of pride.   Updated at 12.48am BST    12.34am   Anthony Albanese press conference  The prime minister is speaking in the Darwin now alongside chief minister Natasha Fyles, on the Nasa agreement announced today:  We\u2019re both pretty new, at our respective jobs. But we\u2019ve both been around for a while and are good friends, and I look forward to working with Tash, including at the first meeting of the national cabinet that we\u2019ll hold in Canberra.  First of all, dinner at The Lodge on Thursday night next week and then a meeting to be held on Friday. There is much work to be done on federal and state relations and streamlining the way that our nation works.

Updated at 12.45am BST    12.28am   Tasmania to raise minimum age of detention from 10 to 14  The Tasmanian government will raise the minimum age of detention from 10 to 14 as part of reform of the youth justice system:   We know that detention does not support rehabilitation or reduce the likelihood of re-offending for younger children.  Early exposure to a detention environment can also further traumatise young people, expose them to problem behaviours of older detainees and increase criminal networks.    An Aboriginal-led push to raise the age of criminal detention from 10 to 14 in Queensland failed after the government and opposition refused to back calls from the Raise the Age coalition.   The ACT was the first jurisdiction in Australia to commit to raising the age of criminal responsibility - separate with detention - in line with UN standards.

She and her family are due to fly to Brisbane this morning, the first stop on their long-awaited journey home to Biloela. Murugappan expressed her gratitude to Perth Children\u2019s hospital, where staff cared for her four-year-old daughter Tharnicaa. The child was medically evacuated from Christmas Island with a blood infection caused by untreated pneumonia:  I\u2019m very grateful to the Perth Children\u2019s hospital. I have made great friends ... me and my family are very happy to start our journey back to my community in Bilo. Thank you to all in Perth \u2013 love you, Perth, thank you.   undefined  Updated at 12.58am BST    12.06am    Environment minister Tanya Plibersek has taken an early interest in independent MP Zali Steggall\u2019s seat of Warringah.       12.01am   NSW records 10 deaths, 7,825 Covid cases  NSW Health has released today\u2019s Covid update.

Updated at 12.21am BST    12.00am    Tackling inflation a key challenge, Katy Gallagher says Finance minister Katy Gallagher was on ABC Breakfast this morning discussing the RBA interest rate hike. She said \u201cevery commentator predicted\u201d there would be an increase:  Tackling rising inflation is a key challenge in the economy and I know it\u2019s going to be a really tough day yesterday for millions of mortgage-holders and households already under enormous pressure from rising cost of living, now rising interest rates and falling wages. It\u2019s a challenging set of circumstances.   Asked if the government would consider calls from Acoss to offer $1,000 energy relief payments for low-income households, Gallagher said there was already short-term relief in the budget announced by the previous government:  We\u2019re putting together a budget for October and as the treasurer has already foreshadowed, a cost-of-living lens will be placed over that budget ... we\u2019re not pretending that there are things, you know, that will solve these long-term challenges. If we look at energy, this has been building up many years.  It\u2019s a deliberate design feature of the previous government\u2019s economic architecture to keep wages low. In two weeks or in a month, these aren\u2019t going to be things that we can turn around but we are working hard and we will make sure that where we can make sensible or provide sensible solutions we\u2019ll make those sensible and responsible investments.   Updated at 12.20am BST    11.52pm   Investigation launched after two women's bodies found in Sydney home  Detectives have launched an investigation after the discovery of two women\u2019s bodies inside a unit in south-west Sydney. About 9.30am yesterday emergency services were called to a home on Canterbury Road after a concern-for-welfare report. The women are yet to be formally identified but are believed to be in their 20s. A crime scene was established and an investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths has begun.  Updated at 12.01am BST    11.47pm    Forecasts for next six months \u2018not pretty\u2019, economist says Chief economist at Rate City Sally Tindall appeared on ABC Breakfast this morning to discuss the RBA\u2019s decision to lift the cash rate to 0.85%. Tindall said the RBA clearly \u201cneeds to get the inflation genie back in the bottle\u201d:  And they\u2019re prepared to do what it takes to get the job done. You only have to look at other countries around the world, such as the United States, where inflation is well over 8%, to see how easily things can get out of hand. So we\u2019ve seen a 0.5% hike.  For the average borrower, $500,000 owing today, 25 years remaining on the home loan, that will see their repayments rise by $133 a month. If you combine it with the May hike from the month before, that\u2019s a total of $197 a month. And for larger loans, that\u2019s obviously more pain. For someone with a $1m loan, for example, they\u2019re looking at $265 a month just from this change yesterday.  Tindall said there was no disputing there would be further increases to come:  After the meeting, all four big bank economists updated their forecasts for the next six months, and let me tell you, it is not pretty ... it\u2019s certainly going to be a lot of money for many people out there. A lot, though, will have built up a bit of a buffer while we\u2019ve had the lower interest rates. But it\u2019s people that have had a change in circumstances that could struggle.    Updated at 11.59pm BST    11.40pm    Pundits tip that cash rate will top 3% by year\u2019s end As we noted yesterday evening in the blog, Westpac and CBA are among the banks to predict the Reserve Bank will follow up with another 50 basis point increase when its board next meets on 5 July. Westpac was also the first to move in lifting its rates, with more expected to follow within days.   The RBA must have pondered just hiking to a big round number like 1%, rather than 0.85%, but perhaps we\u2019ll get to 1.25%. (The last time the central bank raised by more than half a point was in 1994.) Investors, though, have also responded to the RBA\u2019s \u201cjumbo rise\u201d (most economists had tipped yesterday\u2019s move would be no more than 40 basis points \u2013 so the pundits were mostly caught out again). They\u2019re now tipping the cash rate will top 3% by the end of the year:  Many businesses are going to be pinched by the increase and, as one economist pointed out this morning, the media tends to overlook that part of the mix. Perhaps they have more of a chance to pass on the higher costs, but point noted.Meanwhile, among mortgage holders, the financial squeeze could be felt the most among first homebuyers, as we noted in this story today:   Updated at 11.46pm BST    11.33pm    AWU urges windfall tax in response to energy crisis The Australian Workers\u2019 Union is urging the federal government to implement a UK-style windfall tax in response to the energy crisis. AWU national secretary Daniel Walton said multinational gas exporters were using the global situation to \u201ccream astronomical mega-profits from Australians\u201d:  I\u2019ve had manufacturers telling me they are seeing their gas costs rise by as much $100,000 a day. It\u2019s insane and it\u2019s unsustainable. Without drastic action we\u2019re going to see thousands of Australian manufacturing jobs lost this year. The government should tell the gas exporters it\u2019s fine for them to generate record profits, but they also have to ensure some of those mega-profits are used to help the nation that owns the gas. At every stage in discussions the government should be holding a big stick with \u201cwindfall tax\u201d written on it. If the government refuse to pick up that stick now and get tough then gas exporters will bluster and delay and factories will close en masse.   Updated at 11.35pm BST    11.26pm    Don\u2019t prop up coal\u2019s \u2018dirty clunkers\u2019, Adam Bandt says Greens leader Adam Bandt has lashed out at coal producers before Chris Bowen\u2019s meeting with state and territory ministers. He says a subsidy to ageing coal power plants will slow the modernisation of the energy network after calls for coal-fired power stations to be brought online.  The ACT minister attending the meeting will be ACT Greens leader Shane Rattenbury, who led the territory\u2019s transition to 100% renewable energy.  Bandt:  Propping up coal-fired power stations is throwing good money after bad. No amount of patching up these dirty clunkers will fix the problem. We need accelerated investment in new wind, solar, transmission and batteries, not more money for coal. The lesson from the ACT could not be clearer: go 100% renewables, break up with fossil fuels and reap the benefits of cheaper, cleaner, reliable energy. The Greens took a comprehensive plan to the election to phase Australia out of coal and gas by 2030 through a big government build of renewables and grid upgrades and we\u2019re putting it on the table in this parliament.   Updated at 11.34pm BST    11.17pm    \u2018Carrier pigeon pulling balloons of gas?\u2019 Chris Bowen says the opposition are either \u201cvery naive or very dishonest\u201d to have suggested Labor could alleviate the energy crisis by getting on the phone:  The gas pipeline from Queensland to south-east Australia is currently working at 100% capacity, you couldn\u2019t get more gas into it if you tried.  How are they supposing to get extra gas into the pipeline? Bowen muses:  Telepathy? Carrier pigeon pulling balloons of gas?   Updated at 11.30pm BST    11.14pm    Bowen warns there are no easy fixes Energy minster Chris Bowen is appearing on AM with Sabra Lane. Asked if the meeting with state and territory leaders today will have any impact on the energy crisis, he replies:  The state and territory energy ministers will be making progress. There\u2019s no easy fixes here ... and one meeting isn\u2019t going to solve nine years of failed energy policy but we\u2019ve got some meaty issues to discuss.  Bowen says he has been in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the state and territories:  We\u2019ve been making progress all week and no doubt we\u2019ll continue talking about issues in the lead-up to the meeting. It\u2019s more important to make this transition to 82% renewables ... to get that right.  Asked if Bowen will consider handouts for people on lower incomes to deal with the blows, he says there will be cost-of-living relief in the budget and Labor will continue listening to \u201csensible suggestions\u201d across the board to deal with \u201cthis crisis we\u2019ve inherited\u201d.    Updated at 11.29pm BST    11.06pm    Queensland energy minister hails \u2018collaborative\u2019 approach  Queensland\u2019s energy minister has issued a statement before the state and territory leaders\u2019 meeting with Chris Bowen today. Mick de Brenni said he was taking to the meeting with a \u201csense of optimism\u201d: that the new federal government\u2019s \u201ccooperative and collaborative\u201d approach would yield better results than previously seen:  I will take to this meeting direct input from the Queensland energy industry, the conservation sector and energy consumers who will meet with me this morning to provide guidance on how to deliver the best outcome for Queensland.  De Brenni said greater investment in renewables would be the cheapest means to lessen the impacts of the global market and could deliver Australia energy independence:  Whilst all options are on the table for consideration at the EMM, Queensland would continue to promote policy responses that supported our record on delivering new, cheaper and cleaner generation into the market. The formula we are following to keep downward pressure on power prices focuses on connecting more renewables and back-up storage to our grid.   Updated at 11.28pm BST    11.02pm    China\u2019s warning to Australia  China has warned Australia to stop \u201cprovocations\u201d or face \u201cserious consequences\u201d after the federal government said a Chinese jet plane was intercepted, the AFP and Guardian staff report. China said yesterday the Australian P-8 anti-submarine patrol aircraft came near the airspace of the disputed Paracel Islands \u2013 known as Xisha in China. The aircraft \u201capproached for reconnaissance, ignoring repeated warnings from the Chinese side\u201d, defence ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said at a press conference. The People\u2019s Liberation Army organised naval and air forces to identify the military aircraft \u201cissuing a warning to drive it away\u201d, Tan said:  The Australian military plane seriously threatened China\u2019s sovereignty and security and the measures taken by the Chinese military were professional, safe, reasonable and legal.  Tan accused Australia of spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d and called the actions of the Australian pilots \u201cdangerous and provocative\u201d. China warned Australia to manage the actions of its naval and air forces or face \u201cserious consequences\u201d. Defence minister Richard Marles didn\u2019t reveal the exact location of the encounter at the time or exactly how close the planes came to each other \u2013 but he did outline further details at a press conference.   Updated at 11.26pm BST    10.57pm   Nasa rockets to be launched from NT  Nasa rockets will be launched into space from the Northern Territory this month and next under an agreement to be unveiled by the federal and NT governments tomorrow. Anthony Albanese and Northern Territory chief minister Natasha Fyles will confirm that three scientific suborbital sounding rockets will be launched between 26 June and 12 July 2022 from the Arnhem Space Centre, which is owned and run by Equatorial Launch Australia. The two governments say the looming event will be the first time that Nasa launches rockets from a commercial facility outside the US, and they will be the first Nasa rockets launched from Australia since 1995, when launches were conducted from the Royal Australian Air Force Woomera Range complex. Albanese:   We can trace Australia\u2019s celebrated connection to the space industry back to the 1950s and as a nation we have to build on that legacy.  Approximately 75 Nasa personnel will be in Australia for the launches. The two governments say the missions will investigate heliophysics, astrophysics and planetary science phenomena only observable from the southern hemisphere. The Arnhem Space Centre is located on the Dhupuma Plateau near Nhulunbuy, on the lands of the Gumatj people. The two governments say the traditional owners have been consulted as part of the approval process.

Almost all state and territory commissions have the power to hold sparing public hearings. They can potentially be very useful ... it\u2019s a way of building confidence in the activities of the commission if people can see it in operation ... it\u2019s something that prompts others to come forward, it brings out evidence if people hear of the investigation.  Dreyfus reiterates the bill will be introduced this year:  I\u2019m not going to set limits on this commission. It\u2019s independent ... it\u2019s not there to accept instructions from governments of the day.

I\u2019ve been repeatedly asked about pork barrelling ... and if such programs and this goes for any government program ... falls within the commission\u2019s view of serious and systemic corruption ... the ambit of the commissions responsibilities ... then that\u2019s going to be a matter which the commission can determine it will look at.

He said the government needed to pivot \u201creally quickly\u201d to accelerated investment into renewable energy, and to make fossil fuel companies pay their \u201cfair share\u201d of tax:  [The] climate imperative is sitting over the top of everything. I\u2019m happy to work with Labor in the short term around legislation absolutely ... alongside that we need support for people to go electric and invest in solar panels.  McKim said short-term measures like putting a cap on gas prices could be implemented alongside \u201cmeaningful investment\u201d to drive down power prices in favour of renewable energy:   We need a significant shift in thinking in this country ... [not the] same old last tired planet cooking thinking ... [We need to] break the nexus between political parties and the fossil fuel industry.   Updated at 10.35pm BST    10.25pm   Good morning  The energy crisis is continuing to dominate the agenda for the newly elected government. Energy minister Chris Bowen will meet his state and territory counterparts today to discuss possible solutions to the gas supply problems and power prices exacerbating cost-of-living pressures. Caitlin Cassidy is here to take you through it, and unfortunately, we\u2019re spare on good news this morning. The Australian Council of Social Services has written to Bowen warning it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the financial pressures on people with low incomes, while the Greens have warned a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in thinking is needed away from fossil fuels. Speaking of cost-of-living pressures, first homebuyers are likely to be hardest hit by the RBA\u2019s decision to lift the official cash rate to o.85% yesterday, the highest increase in more than 20 years. More increases have been flagged in coming months to curb unacceptable levels of inflation.  Westpac is the first major bank to pass on the full value of the interest rate rise to mortgage holders, with the other banks expected to make their decision today. We\u2019re not the only ones feeling the pinch. The World Bank has warned the nation is on the cusp of a situation similar to the 1970s oil price shocks as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, slowing economic growth and pushing up the prices of goods. In better news, Australia has kept its World Cup dream alive after defeating the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in a qualifier match in Qatar. The final, sudden-death playoff for a spot in the cup will take place next Monday against Peru.  There\u2019s much to get to, so let\u2019s get cracking.  Updated at 10.28pm BST "

                    "body": "  12.06pm   What we learned today, 20 April  Kapow! Biff! Bam!  Maybe not. The first leaders\u2019 debate is over. There was no knockout blow:  It ended with the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, winning 40% of the undecided voters\u2019 votes, Scott Morrison getting 35%, and the rest remaining undecided.  The furore over the signing of a Solomon Islands and China security agreement was a hot topic, as were cost of living questions. Listen to today\u2019s Campaign catchup to get across the issue.  Morrison will cop heat for saying he and his wife Jenny were \u201cblessed\u201d with their children (who don\u2019t have disabilities), while a terse exchange over boat turnbacks will also be dissected.  Aside from the debate, in late-breaking news, Julian Assange\u2019s extradition to the US has been approved.  The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, had to pull some election ads after claiming endorsement from Guide Dogs Victoria.  So far, 2022 has already seen more than twice as many deaths as the previous two years.  And today we are all a hot air balloon, crashing to earth in Melbourne.   Amy Remeikis will be back with you in the morning to continue dissecting the debate along with Katharine Murphy and the rest of the politics team. So long. Farewell!   Updated at 12.09pm BST    11.51am   Albanese wins 40% of audience vote at leaders' debate over Morrison's 35%  And a result! From the 100 undecided voters in the audience: 35% for Scott Morrison, 40% for Anthony Albanese, and 25% remain undecided.  Updated at 11.56am BST    11.33am    Penny Wong was up next. Asked why Labor has blamed a security deal between two sovereign nations on Scott Morrison and the Coalition, Wong responded:  It is true that the Solomon Islands is a sovereign nation. But that doesn\u2019t absolve Morrison of his responsibility as Australia\u2019s leader. And the fact is, this is the worst foreign policy blunder that we\u2019ve seen in the Pacific since World War II. And despite Mr Morrison\u2019s tough talk, on his watch our region has become less secure, and the risks Australia faces have become greater.   Asked what Labor would have done differently, Wong said the opposition wouldn\u2019t have reduced development assistance to the region, nor would she have mocked Pacific leaders \u201cby joking about water lapping at their doors, as Mr Dutton did with Mr Morrison standing next to him\u201d:  We would have been credible on climate. And we would not have mismanaged the Pacific Labour Scheme. All of this adds up to a failure of diplomacy, a failure of strategy, and a failure of leadership ... what you should expect from us if we are elected is more resources and more energy and more focus on securing our region.    Updated at 11.37am BST    11.32am    While Albanese and Morrison were battling it out in the marketplace of ideas, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and shadow minister, Penny Wong, were up on 7.30 as fallout over Solomon Islands\u2019 deal with China continues. Payne deflected any plan to jump on a plane and head to Solomon Islands right away as her predecessor Julie Bishop advocated for today, dismissing claims the deal demonstrates a failure of Australian leadership in the region:  We have carefully calibrated our approach on these issue and in fact across the Pacific. It\u2019s not just about engaging with the Solomon Islands. There are many of our counterparts with whom we have been discussing these issues.  And it is Australia, frankly, that has been at the forefront of these discussions about the geostrategic realities that we face in the Pacific ... over a number of years now.  Payne continued, citing concerns over the deal\u2019s lack of transparency:   I do think that it is important to note respectfully that countries will always make their own sovereign decisions. We have been respectfully very clear about our concerns of the challenges that this agreement poses.  We\u2019ve been very clear about our concerns on the lack of transparency that\u2019s attached to this agreement \u2013 unlike the bilateral security treaty between Australia and the Solomon Islands, which was openly published on the Australian Treaties website, there for all to see. This is not equally open and transparent. We think that that\u2019s important.   Updated at 11.36am BST    11.30am    Shortly we\u2019ll have the result from those voters in the audience, so stay tuned.      11.11am    And that was the first leaders\u2019 debate of the 2022 election. Let the analysis, the pulling apart, the factchecking, the bouquets and the brickbats begin!   Updated at 11.12am BST    11.10am   Albanese says as PM he would 'accept responsibility every day'  And the final word from Albanese:   I think the problem for this government is that they have been in office for almost a decade. They are shooting for a second decade in office and they haven\u2019t shown any plan ... about how you actually grow wages. How you have an economy that works for people, not the other way around.  I want an economy that sees wages being lifted. I want people to enjoy a higher standard of living. I want us to aspire and to be as optimistic as as we should be as a country.  I have two simple philosophies. One is that no one is left behind. That is, the Labor party will always look after the disadvantaged. That\u2019s why we do things.  We\u2019re the party of opportunity. We\u2019re the party that understands that if we\u2019re going to advance as an economy, then we need to have stronger education. And we see the economy is growing. The opportunity there is there to use clean energy, to drive high value manufacturing, to drive growth through the economy.  If I\u2019m prime minister, I\u2019ll accept responsibility each and every day. I\u2019ll work hard, and I\u2019ll accept responsibility, and not always seek to blame someone else.     Updated at 11.18am BST    11.07am   Morrison focuses on economic credentials in closing statement  Both say again they won\u2019t form a government with the independents. Morrison says \u201cof course\u201d Labor will with the Greens, which Albanese calls \u201cnonsense\u201d.  And here\u2019s Morrison\u2019s closing statement:  This election is a choice, and these processes are important to help people make their choice. But fundamentally, I really believe this election is all about the economy that you, and your family, and your communities will live in for the next 10 years.  It will determine your economic opportunities, your job, your wages, all of these things, and services \u2013 can Australia can afford to deliver the essential services that you rely on? It all starts with managing a strong economy. Our government has proven that with a strong economic plan that has been delivering unemployment falling to 4% ,a triple A credit rating, the biggest budget turnaround seen in 70 years, the future \u2013 we\u2019re heading in the right direction.  Now is not the time to turn back. So I thank you for your questions and I look forward to the opportunities Australia has, as we seize them, with the economic plan that we know is working, and will continue to work for you and your family, and the essential services you rely on.   Updated at 11.11am BST    11.04am    Morrison\u2019s blaming social media. He says it\u2019s \u201cterribly sad\u201d what happens online, and that the big tech companies have to take responsibility:  The way people engage on social media, I think, is incredibly dangerous.  It has its great advantages. Families stay connected in ways that we never could before. But at the same time what has happened with social media in our political debate over the last 10 years, it makes me terribly sad.  And I think young people have been most affected by that \u2013 there are things that people would never say to each other, but they will write it in a comment and hurtful and it\u2019s destructive.    Updated at 11.09am BST    11.03am    \u201cLucy\u201d has snuck in another question about diminishing support for democracy, about disillusionment and about stories about bullying and so on in parliament. Albanese says a figure Lucy mentioned of only 55% of 18 year olds being enrolled to vote was of real concern. He says:   We have such a proud history in this country, in terms of women\u2019s participation in the political system ... We need to do much better. We need to engage with young people, we need to engage on issues that involve them, because they are our future.  And I know that young people are particularly concerned about issues like climate change, making sure that the world ... is one that\u2019s at least as pristine as the one that\u2019s there at the moment. So I think it\u2019s a matter of us reaching out, engaging, working out new ways of participation, as well, in the political process.    Updated at 11.07am BST    11.02am    Albanese continues:  We need to look for areas of agreement, areas of consensus, areas in which the country can be united going forward instead of the constant argy bargy which does seem to dominate a lot of our politics and I think you\u2019re right, it\u2019s putting people off.   Updated at 11.05am BST    11.01am    Albanese goes first to a national integrity commission, and the need to look for areas of agreement and ways to unite the country:   We will do different things but I think it\u2019s also important to restore faith in politics ... and I want to unite the country. I want to not be a prime minister who\u2019s always looking for the wedge always looking for the division. Because if we\u2019re going to move forward as a country, we need to work out our common interests.    Updated at 11.05am BST    10.59am    Last question before closing statements is about how the leaders plan to restore trust in the democratic process.  Morrison says it\u2019s all about the economy:   Our economic plan is about helping Australians realise their big aspirations in life, have their kids, to raise them, to give them a good education, to buy a home, to save for their retirement, to run a business and to have choices.  Our economic plan is delivering that. Our economy now is one of the strongest in the world, of the advanced world, and that\u2019s giving Australians opportunities every single day. And what I\u2019ve learned from my years in politics, is that unless you can run a strong economy and manage money, maintain the triple A credit rating, change the economy moving forward, then your aspirations for so many of these other issues can\u2019t be achieved.  And that\u2019s why this election is very much about who can run the economy and who can manage money. And following through on those plans, doing what we said we would do, ensuring we said we would get more Australians in their own homes.    Updated at 11.04am BST    10.56am    Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, earlier called senator Zed Seselja a \u201cwoodchuck\u201d when he was sent to Solomon Islands. Albanese calls him a \u201cjuniorburger\u201d, and says:  This government have been complacent here. They cut aid to the Solomons. We should have been on top of this issue. We all agree. We all agree that China has been aggressive. The question is, how do you respond to it?     Updated at 11.03am BST    10.56am    Dialling back to Morrison\u2019s response on recent flooding events, and the prime minister reminds viewers he was actually in Brisbane during the floods:  $400 million in Queensland has already been directly paid out through the disaster recovery allowance ... the same payments made during the bushfires. I was here [in Brisbane] when it was occurring on that Sunday night ... we saw more defence force people turn out here in Brisbane quicker than they did during the floods of 2011. I was out ... that\u2019s just a fact, that\u2019s just true, the defence forces have done an amazing job.   Updated at 11.02am BST    10.55am    Albanese says it\u2019s \u201cnot so much a Pacific step up \u2013 it\u2019s a Pacific stuff up\u201d:  The truth is that we all know that China has changed. China has changed. It\u2019s more aggressive. It\u2019s more active in the region, and we need to understand that and respond to it. They\u2019re not really stepping up. This isn\u2019t so much a Pacific step up \u2013 it\u2019s a Pacific stuff up.    Updated at 10.59am BST    10.54am    And now he\u2019s accused Labor of taking China\u2019s side on this. (Wow.)  \u201cThat\u2019s an outrageous slur,\u201d Albanese says.      10.54am    Albanese says the disaster ready fund, if Labor is elected, will provide $200 million every year on disaster preparedness to better respond to the threat of climate change:  What we\u2019ve said is we\u2019ll have a disaster ready fund. $200 million every year will be spent on making sure preparedness is done for cyclones, for floods, for bushfires, for extreme weather events that we know from the science \u2013 climate change tells us that it\u2019s here. The government has acted, in our very strong view, too little, too late to provide that investment in the first place, and then the support. The government should have exercised its power to declare a national emergency, not just in New South Wales but in Queensland when the event happened \u2013 not wait until it was too late.   Updated at 10.57am BST    10.53am   China-Solomon Islands pact not a policy failure: PM  Now on the security agreement between Solomon Islands and China. How is that not a foreign policy failure, Gilbert asks Morrison.  Morrison says it\u2019s not a policy failure, it\u2019s because \u201cChina is seeking to interfere in the Pacific\u201d. He says Australia has done its bit:   This is a very serious issue and one that we\u2019ve been conscious of for a very long time. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve increased our Pacific step up funding to $1.8bn a year to be supporting our Pacific family.  He says he\u2019s been called \u201cracist\u201d for calling out China.    Updated at 11.03am BST    10.52am    Albanese criticises the Coalition\u2019s delay in declaring an emergency during the floods, and says Labor will have a disaster ready fund.  Morrison lists the money the government has spent on flood mitigation, and has a bit of a crack at the states on bushfires:  One of the things we want to see is greater transparency on the management of fuel loads, not just in the national parks, but in the forestry estates and the other areas where fuel loads build up. And when those fuel loads burn up, we know what happens. But we don\u2019t have any transparency at the moment from the states about how those fuel loads are being managed.    Updated at 10.54am BST    10.49am    Now on the flood response. Albanese says:   We have been critical of the Emergency Response Fund. That was created with our support \u2013 but it was created with the idea that $200 million would be spent every year, some of it on recovery, some of it on mitigation, on planning, [on bushfire and flood preparedness]. And yet it just stayed there. It stayed there as if it was a term deposit and it\u2019s grown now to $4.8bn.    Updated at 10.55am BST    10.47am    Morrison is defending lifting some of the emergency measures, saying they \u201cno longer apply\u201d.      10.46am    The same questioner outlines other ways he got left behind by the pandemic. Albanese says Labor supports the small business tax cut and changes to the asset write-off, and that low wages are one of the things a Labor government would tackle:   We think that in terms of taking pressure off your small business, what we need to do is to have a plan as well to lift wages throughout the economy.  One of the things that\u2019s happening is that if people haven\u2019t got enough money to spend, if they\u2019re struggling to get by, they can\u2019t afford to go to the local cafe, they cut back. And that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s holding back our economy.    Updated at 10.53am BST    10.45am    Moving back to the NDIS for a minute, Albanese\u2019s justification for prioritising NDIS funding was down to participation:   If you allow everyone to participate in society you\u2019ll get better outcomes - obviously better social outcomes, but also better economic outcomes.  Morrison replied with a rebuttal on money:  It\u2019s always the Liberals and Nationals who have to work out how to pay for these things ... this election is really about the economy ... one of the most important things I can do to ensure the NDIS is fully funded is we continue to run a strong economy.  Albanese jumped in:  It isn\u2019t just the NDIS. The PBS was another Labor initiative. Labor does the big things and we also do the big reforms. What the prime minister has attempted to do there is we have an issue for paying for things ... we just went through three consecutive decades of economic growth because of the Hawke/Keating government.  Albanese said while Labor implemented the NDIS and paid parental leave, the Rudd government also emerged from the global financial crisis relatively unscathed:   You can\u2019t be scared of the future, you have to shape the future, otherwise the future will shape you.    Updated at 10.51am BST    10.44am    A small business owner is up now, saying he and those like him were left out in the cold. What are the plans for small businesses?  Morrison says:  We\u2019ve cut taxes for small business by 25%. Second of all, we\u2019ve provided the instant asset write-off and what that means is ... if you go and spend on a new piece of ... equipment, a coffee machine, a fridge or a new machine in your tool kit, then you can write that off 100%. And so we\u2019ve lowered taxes for small businesses because it is tough. One of the key things that small businesses have to deal with is their cashflow. And in this budget, we provided 100% tax deduction for those who were training [people], but also on the investments you have to make.   Updated at 10.47am BST    10.42am    Jumping from the debate for a moment, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, is up now on 7.30 following Solomon Islands\u2019 deal with China. Leigh Sales asks if Payne has any plans to head to Solomon Islands in the wake of the deal. She deflects:   Leigh, as you know, the minister for the pacific and international development ... was there in the last week. Of course, I\u2019ve been in contact with my counterpart, the foreign minister ... the prime minister\u2019s been in contact with prime minister Sogavare. There\u2019s been extensive engagement across the government ...  We understand, though, that this is a very serious decision that Solomon Islands has made. We are, as we said today, deeply disappointed they have chosen to go down this path. Ultimately, it is a sovereign decision for the Solomon Islands.   Updated at 10.46am BST    10.41am    Morrison goes on to say jobkeeper saved many lives and hundreds of thousands of lives. He says:   It saved 700,000 jobs, and I believe many many lives because Australians were thinking \u2013 they were going to work that day on the day we announced it, and [they were thinking] it would be their last day in work ... and that the Australian economy would be ruined.  Albanese says whoever was in government would have had to put stimulus measures in place, and that it\u2019s the \u201cwaste\u201d he is protesting against. He says:   We have no problem with the economic stimulus in terms of the need for one. What we have a problem with is the waste. There was too much waste there. And this has been a wasteful government.  He also points out that the Coalition has doubled the debt levels from before the pandemic.    Updated at 10.45am BST    10.38am    Gilbert is now asking about debt and deficit, and asks Morrison if he\u2019ll turn his focus to budget repair if he wins.  Morrison says the budget has turned around by more than $100bn in the past year:   That is the single biggest turnaround in a budget in 70 years.  And the reason for that is we\u2019ve got people into work, off welfare and into work.  That is the major way you turn a budget around, as well as making sure you control your expenditure that has risen because it had to, because we all know when we went into the pandemic, we were facing the biggest crisis we had seen since the Great Depression.   Updated at 10.40am BST    10.37am    Albanese responds to that last comment from Morrison. He says Labor \u201cdoes the big reforms\u201d while \u201cthis government has held us back\u201d.  \u201cYou have to shape the future or the future will shape you,\u201d he says.    Updated at 10.39am BST    10.36am   NDIS a \u2018proud Labor reform that we will fix\u2019: Albanese  Albanese says Ethan\u2019s (Catherine\u2019s son\u2019s) story isn\u2019t an isolated one.  The NDIS is a \u201cproud Labor reform that we will fix\u201d, he says, giving the example of someone who was told to reuse a colostomy bag. He says:   If we\u2019re sensible about this, and get it right, one of the things about the NDIS is that it is certainly isn\u2019t welfare. All of the analysis shows, if you allow everyone to participate in society, you will get better outcomes, obviously better social outcomes, but you\u2019ll also get better economic outcomes as well.  Morrison brings it back to the economy and says Labor may bring in such schemes, but it\u2019s up to Liberal governments to work out how to pay for them:   It\u2019s always the Liberals who have to work out how to pay for these things. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done over the last eight years. Now I make this point very importantly, because I said at the start that this election is really about the economy.    Updated at 10.39am BST    10.33am    Morrison continues, praising the NDIS:  The thing I love about the NDIS is it\u2019s not welfare \u2013 what it\u2019s designed to do is help people with disabilities live their best possible life, like my brother-in-law Gary, who has multiple sclerosis.   Updated at 10.35am BST    10.32am    A question now about the NDIS, and stories about people having their funds cut. What does the future of the NDIS look like? Morrison says he and Jenny have been \u201cblessed\u201d because their kids don\u2019t have disabilities.  And he pays tribute to former prime minister Julia Gillard for creating the NDIS. He says:   We are fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It\u2019s a difficult scheme to manage, because every single person who has a disability is different. There\u2019s no cookie cutter approach to the NDIS.  He adds:  It can be a very difficult system ... It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s more expensive than Medicare.  The questioner, Catherine, asks again about those funding cuts. Morrison says he\u2019ll look into the case she\u2019s talking about.   Updated at 10.39am BST    10.29am    Morrison says \u201cthey are being made here\u201d:   We\u2019re investing $22 billion between now and 2030 on ensuring that we\u2019re developing the clean energy technology, which includes batteries that will enable us to transition our economy \u2013 and not just ours, by the way, but the economies in our region as well, to ensure that they can get access to this technology.  Now, Anthony is right about critical minerals and rare earths. These rare earths and critical metals, particularly coming out of Western Australia, they are a major opportunity for Australia.  He adds:  I think Australia can be an energy powerhouse.    Updated at 10.32am BST    10.29am    A bit of back and forth now between Albanese and Morrison on boat turn backs. Morrison says Labor hasn\u2019t been consistent in its policy of turning back the boats. Albanese:  Why is it, Scott, you\u2019re always looking for a division, not looking for an agreement?  Morrison:   I\u2019m just looking for the accuracy and the truth.   Updated at 10.31am BST    10.28am    And now a question on electric vehicles.  Albanese says \u201cwe need to make more things here\u201d, including batteries. \u201cThis is a potential major industry here in Australia,\u201d he says:  We need to do more to create those high value jobs. I support exporting our resources, but where possible, we should be value adding here rather than seeing the value add somewhere else, and the jobs created somewhere else, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.  And he gets a crack in about Morrison predicting EVs would \u201cend the weekend\u201d.    Updated at 10.32am BST    10.26am   Albanese and Morrison clash on boat turnbacks  And now straight into border protection. Morrison says (I\u2019m paraphrasing) that he stopped the boats. He says:   It\u2019s not easy. And you have to believe in it. You have to understand it. You have to understand how to do it safely. You have to understand how it works with all the other areas of your border protection policy, which has temporary protection visas and offshore processing. Other countries around the world have said Australia got that right.   And some fire from Albanese when Morrison says he didn\u2019t support boat turnbacks.  \u201cThe truth is we support boat turnbacks, and we\u2019ll do it,\u201d Albanese says when Morrison asks if he did back in the day.    Updated at 10.30am BST    10.25am    Debate continues on the cashless debit card. Albanese says the Labor government would scrap it if they were to be elected:  The cashless debit card not only tells you what you can buy \u2013 it\u2019s who you can buy it from, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll get rid of it.  Morrison responds, saying the card assists people in \u201cvulnerable communities\u201d to \u201cget up on their feet\u201d:  The Labor party wants to get rid of the cashless debit card where ... what it works like is just like a debit card.  It\u2019s an electronic card that means people in vulnerable situations are able to manage their income better, which means they can get food on the table for their kids ... and [it is] giving vulnerable Australians the support they need to get up on their feet.   Updated at 10.27am BST    10.24am    And now we\u2019re on to the cashless debit card. Albanese repeats the pledge that Labor will get rid of it.  Morrison jumps in to say the Coalition will not apply the card to pensioners (this has been a matter of quite some debate and skulduggery). He says:   The commonwealth government \u2013 my government, our government \u2013 is not putting the cashless debit card on pensioners. It\u2019s not happening, not happening.   Updated at 10.26am BST    10.22am    Albanese goes on to say:   The government\u2019s model would have ministers determine whether they can be investigated or not. It needs to be independent, at arm\u2019s length. It needs to have the capacity to have public hearings if it deems that that is in the public interest. And it does need to have some teeth.      10.21am    Albanese is responding on the question of a federal integrity commission, and says \u201cthere\u2019s a stench\u201d with sports rorts, carpark rorts, abuse of taxpayers\u2019 money \u2013 so we need an anti-corruption commission with teeth. He says:  It\u2019s an issue where we need to restore faith in the political system. Now I think overwhelmingly, people go into politics for all the right reasons, whether they be Labor, Liberal or minor party people. But the truth is, there\u2019s a stench around a whole range of issues in Canberra.    Updated at 10.24am BST    10.19am    On aged care, Albanese says while the Coalition did implement some of the royal commission\u2019s recommendations, there was \u201cnothing there\u201d for addressing workforce shortages.  The missing pieces were all about workforce, there was nothing there but one off payments to aged care workers. One payment was supposed to happen in March, another in May, but it all ends as soon as people cast their votes. The royal commission found unless we do something about increasing wages we won\u2019t have a workforce ... that\u2019s why we need ... a plan for workforce, that\u2019s the missing piece, it just isn\u2019t there.   Updated at 10.23am BST    10.17am    The next question is about the \u201ctoothless tiger\u201d that is the Coalition\u2019s federal integrity commission plan. Morrison says that a federal commission would not be a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and would have a different scope to state versions. He says:   You\u2019re dealing with things like immigration decisions and tax office and things of that nature, so a different set of issues [to the states]. You\u2019re dealing with our proposal for a commonwealth integrity commission, which has 357 pages in legislation, and a budget of $60 million, which is in the budget.  We\u2019ve already spent $50m applying that to the Australian commission for law enforcement integrity, which they police, the Home Affairs Department, the federal police, these sorts of organisations that already exist to ensure that integrity is upheld in those important institutions.   Updated at 10.22am BST    10.16am    Morrison says Labor\u2019s plans to have 24/7 nurses in rural and remote facilities will close those facilities down.   We are training more nurses and we need to train more nurses. But aged care is complex and difficult. There are no simple solutions. You can\u2019t all of a sudden say that there\u2019s going to be all of these nurses to go in there, because if you make it a standard thing, you have to hold to that standard.  And if you applied that today, you\u2019d be shutting down aged care facilities right across the country.     Updated at 10.19am BST    10.14am    Morrison is paying tribute to aged care workers, and says he created the royal commission into aged care to ensure that all Australians can \u201cage with dignity\u201d.  He says there are complex and difficult problems:   We can\u2019t just make nurses all of a sudden fall out of the sky and be able to go and meet a 24/7 commitment to have a nurse in every single aged care [facility].    Updated at 10.15am BST    10.13am    Albanese also talks about getting the Maggie Beer Foundation in to help with aged care nutrition, and says:   They\u2019re literally starving. and we had cases like food being scraped up off plates, put in a blender and served the next day.   Updated at 10.15am BST    10.12am    And now a question on nurses, which both sides have been asked about.  Albanese is up first, talking about \u201cputting the nurses back into nursing homes\u201d. There\u2019ll be additional university places, he says:   We need to train up more nurses for the jobs that will become available, because we will need more \u2013 we\u2019ve got an ageing of the population, so we will need more care workers across the board.    Updated at 10.15am BST    10.10am    Morrison does go to foreign ownership, saying:   Not only have we toughened the laws on foreign ownership in this country for residential real estate, but more importantly, increased the resources for the Australian Taxation Office to make sure they\u2019ve been complied with.      10.09am    Albanese is focusing on affordable and social housing. He says:   It\u2019s a common story you hear all around Australia, people are worried about whether their kids will ever get into that great Australian dream that I was raised with of owning your own home. That was something that we took for granted.  Perhaps I grew up in public housing, where my mom lived in the same one house for all of her 65 years, but she drummed into me: when you get the opportunity, save for a deposit, buy your own home. But I know that it\u2019s just so tough now.   He talks about rental costs as well, which Morrison didn\u2019t really touch on.   Updated at 10.13am BST    10.08am    The first question \u2013 no big surprise \u2013 is on house prices, and on foreign ownership. Morrison says he gets it \u2013 it was tough 30 years ago when he and Jenny bought, and \u201cit\u2019s tougher now\u201d. He says the Coalition is helping people into their own homes with a lower deposit thanks to their deposit guarantees, and other programs:  The home guarantee scheme, the home builder program ... gave people grants to support to build their own home, and there was also the national housing finance and investment corporation that was loaning to community housing organisations so they could build more affordable dwelling units.    Updated at 10.13am BST    10.05am    Albanese:   Scott and I agree that Australia\u2019s the greatest country on Earth, but I believe we can have a better future if we have a better government.  You all know that the cost of everything is going up but your wages aren\u2019t. That\u2019s why we need to lift wages. We need to plan for cheaper childcare, cheaper electricity, we need to plan for housing affordability. We need to make sure we have a strong economy with secure work. And we need to make more things here using cheap, clean energy to drive manufacturing again.   The government hasn\u2019t learned from its mistakes, he says, and we can do better \u2013 with a federal integrity commission.    Updated at 10.08am BST    10.04am    Morrison thanks everyone for joining \u201cafter everything we\u2019ve been through as a country over these last few years\u201d.  He says:   I am incredibly optimistic about Australia\u2019s future. Australians are incredibly resilient ... and now we\u2019re in a very strong position despite the many challenges we continue to face, our economy today is one of the strongest in the advanced world. Two years ago, we were told unemployment would go to 15%, but today it\u2019s at 4%.  [This election] is a choice between a stronger economy and a weaker economy. A stronger future and an uncertain one.    Updated at 10.07am BST    10.01am    The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, shake hands and grin for the audience and camera, and the PM is off with his opening statement.   Updated at 10.03am BST    10.01am    And now we\u2019re over to host Kieran Gilbert. He\u2019s welcoming that audience of 100 undecided voters to the Gabba.   Updated at 10.03am BST    10.00am   Leaders' debate begins  There\u2019s applause from the audience at the people\u2019s forum, and laughter, but unfortunately the Sky News talking heads mean I can\u2019t actually see what\u2019s happened ... anyway, we\u2019re about to start!   Updated at 10.03am BST    9.54am    Our politics team has pretty solidly covered the important stuff about tonight\u2019s debate, but here\u2019s another succinct guide from the ABC. And of course, we\u2019ll be covering the highlights (and lowlights) tonight and tomorrow (and if they\u2019re particularly high or low, they may continue to ripple through the election campaign).   Updated at 9.57am BST    9.32am         9.29am    As we barrel towards the leaders\u2019 debate (or the people\u2019s forum, as Sky News styles it), it\u2019s worth taking another look at the latest Essential poll.  Seven per cent of voters are undecided. That is more than enough to swing an election (insert all disclaimers here about the lumpiness of the vote spread, the unknowables about preference cascades, and the margins of error).  Sky promises the 100-strong audience for tonight\u2019s debate is all undecided voters, which should up the spice content. Katharine Murphy has all the latest poll numbers here:    Updated at 9.33am BST    9.20am         9.06am    Josh Butler has herded a lot of cats today to bring you this campaign briefing:       8.57am    And Anthony Albanese dons the hi-vis:     Updated at 9.40am BST    8.53am    A couple of pics from Scott Morrison\u2019s swift visit to Adelaide this morning from AAP:     Updated at 8.58am BST    8.41am    NSW treasurer Matt Kean is on Sky News trying to discuss nuanced issues about transgender people with Chris Kenny. Yikes.  Kean called for Liberal Warringah candidate Katherine Deves to be disendorsed and Kenny ... doesn\u2019t agree.  (PS: apologies, I prematurely published this just before!)   Updated at 8.43am BST    8.18am    Need a quick refresher before tonight\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate? Jane Lee and Sarah Martin have your back with the Campaign catchup:       8.14am    Is my maths right? This would mean about six in 10 tests in the past 24 hours came back positive (the rate was about half that yesterday):    Updated at 8.15am BST    8.10am    For some essential reading before the debate, Paul Karp\u2019s latest fact check is out. Labor is warning that a return of the Coalition\u2019s omnibus industrial relations bill will mean changes to the better off overall test, allowing pay cuts. Scott Morrison has dismissed this as \u201canother scare campaign\u201d following on from Labor\u2019s claims about aged pensioners being put on the cashless debit card. Read the verdict here:      7.55am    Kate Palmer, the former CEO of the Australian Sports Commission, is on the ABC talking to Fran Kelly. Palmer says that since guidelines on the inclusion of transgender and gender diverse people in sport were released in 2019, it has been heartening to receive messages from trans women saying thank you, and providing examples of welcoming sports communities \u2013 often in Australia\u2019s regions.  Asked \u201chow big an issue\u201d the inclusion of transgender people in sport is, Palmer replies \u201cit\u2019s not at the top of our list\u201d and says language used in the public sphere hasn\u2019t been appropriate.  There are many more critical issues to deal with and it puts sport in a really difficult position because sport is doing a terrific job of including people in their organisations ... This is putting them off track, so for me, it\u2019s not an issue that they need to deal with critically.  Palmer says she intends to focus on what matters for women in sport \u2013 which means \u201cmore investment, more infrastructure, equal opportunity\u201d.  Updated at 8.05am BST    7.46am    Meanwhile, the prime minister has gotten his head in the game before tonight\u2019s debate with a swim at a Brisbane pool.  \u201cGood to get in a few laps,\u201d he remarks.       7.34am    The fallback is to fear, Hugh Riminton writes:       7.22am   Zed Seselja on Joyce's Solomons warning: 'We are a long way from that'  In case you missed it earlier, here was deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce\u2019s contribution to the discussion. He said:   Solomon Islands is a sovereign nation. They\u2019ve decided to have a pact with China, dual purpose, which means China is able, if they follow through, to set up a military base there. That will be, absolutely, that\u2019s a very bad day for Australia. We don\u2019t want our own little Cuba off our coast.  Asked about those comments, Seselja says: \u201cWe are a long way from that,\u201d before making it about the opposition:   We have an opposition who make claims that are false, [that are] for their own political ends.   Updated at 7.49am BST    7.17am    Pacific minister Zed Seselja is on the ABC, talking to Greg Jennett. Jennett asks if there\u2019s any plan to send foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, to Solomon Islands after they signed that security agreement with China (Labor has criticised her for not going, and for Seselja going in her place). He says that\u2019s not the fundamental issue: \u201cThe fundamental issue is how we can continue to engage at every level with the Solomon Islands government.  We have a disagreement on this, as friends and a Pacific family [we] will continue to express that. We will ask for the Solomon Islands government [that] they be transparent about what is in the agreement.  That\u2019s very important going forward [that] the entire region can see what it is, because we\u2019ve had assurances which I think are good assurances in relation to the fact that there will never be bases and Australia will continue to be the first port of call and security partner of choice.\u201d Catch up on the back story here:    Updated at 7.31am BST    7.12am   First Dog on the Moon  OK, just one more on the dog theme. But this is First Dog, and he is such a good boy:    Updated at 7.32am BST    7.02am    The video of today\u2019s hot air balloon crash is quite wild and comes with a profanity warning. The whole story is quite a gas, really. Caitlin Cassidy and AAP here:       6.53am    And now for some very different dog content. Khaled Al Khawaldeh reports on treasurer Josh Frydenberg pulling those election ads:       6.48am    It would have been somewhat surprising if prime minister Scott Morrison touched down anywhere else. Would love to get a sneak peek at how rehearsals go.       6.46am    A man got stuck headfirst in a septic tank in Sydney earlier today.  And then he was saved by a dog.  A border collie named Spot heard the man\u2019s cries, and the dog\u2019s 13-year-old human called authorities. AAP reports the man was rescued by intensive care paramedics and Fire and Rescue NSW. AAP reports:  The man was a contractor working on the property when he became stuck in the septic tank, commonly used where homes are not connected to sewerage. He had been trapped upside down and unable to free himself from the tank as the water rose. NSW Ambulance acting inspector, Charnan Kurth, said the four paramedic crews that attended faced a challenging scene as they worked to free the man. His extraction took about 40 minutes. \u201cHad the dog not heard the man\u2019s cries, it may not have been such a good ending,\u201d Inspector Kurth said.  Updated at 6.58am BST    6.37am    Hours after Albanese vs Morrison will be Macron vs Le Pen.  The French presidential debate between current leader, Emmanuel Macron, and his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen will happen late Wednesday France time, so early on Thursday for us here, as al Jazeera reports.  Macron will seek to portray Le Pen as untrustworthy. We\u2019ll see if \u201cI don\u2019t think, I know!\u201d gets another run.   Updated at 6.39am BST    6.20am    Western Australia premier Mark McGowan has had a negative result on a PCR test, but will isolate after a family member tested positive, AAP reports.  He says he\u2019ll work from home while isolating, but AAP says he\u2019s expected to be out in time for the federal Labor election campaign launch in Perth on 1 May. McGowan says:   Western Australians have done such a great job of doing the right thing and following the health advice to keep the spread of the virus to a minimum and reach the soft landing we all sought out to achieve.  WA changed the definition of a close contact last week, so only household members and intimate partners have to isolate. The state, which has had the strictest border controls throughout the pandemic, recorded 8,080 cases today.      6.15am         6.11am    Gilbert asks Chalmers what he\u2019ll say to Albanese in the green room before he takes to the stage. He\u2019ll be relaxed, Chalmers says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be looking forward to it.\u201d      6.08am    Labor\u2019s treasury spokesperson, Jim Chalmers, is part of the debate warm up (which is going for half the day).  He\u2019s talking to host Keiran Gilbert about the opposition\u2019s budget repair aims \u2013 I\u2019m going to summarise: Spend less, make more, stop rorts, tax the multinationals.  Gilbert says the debate is a challenge for the leaders to be aggressive towards each other while appearing prime ministerial. Chalmers, naturally, reckons Labor leader Anthony Albanese will strike just the right balance.   Updated at 6.13am BST    6.05am    Thank you, Amy Remeikis! I\u2019m limbering up my ageing, creaking fingers for tonight. I have the special keyboard out. Wish me luck!   Updated at 6.06am BST    5.58am    It\u2019s all about the debate tonight, which Tory Shepherd will take you through. So if you can\u2019t watch it, check back here for updates on how it\u2019s going. The questions are coming from undecided voters so it should be interesting to hear just what some of those voters care about. Thank you for joining me today. I\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning with the wash-up. In the meantime, take care of you.     5.48am    Scott Morrison spoke with Adelaide radio 5AA this morning, where he was asked if his second visit to Adelaide within a week meant he was worried about losing seats. This is how he answered it: \u201cWell, we\u2019re now in the formal election campaign period, and I\u2019m taking every opportunity to move around the country and be very clear to the Australian people that there is a choice here. And elections are about a choice. And you know, we\u2019ve come through this pandemic with one of the strongest economies in the world.  The IMF, the International Monetary Fund, has confirmed that again today, actually revising up where Australia\u2019s economy is going while revising down many of the other advanced economies around the world.  We\u2019ve had a big budget turnaround because of our strong economic plan. Unemployment in South Australia has been falling since September of last year, down to 4.9% now here in South Australia, and we want to be able to keep the South Australian economy strong.  That\u2019s why we need to continue making the investments, investments in ensuring that that economy can remain strong.\u201d Despite the strong result for SA Labor in the state election, Boothby is considered the only electorate Labor could potentially pick up in the federal election \u2013 but despite always looking like it could swing, voters keep it blue.  Updated at 5.53am BST    5.29am    Peter Lewis from Essential has some further take aways from the latest Guardian Essential poll:      5.23am    Still waiting on the AEC to get back to us on this. (That is a joke, obviously).   Updated at 5.29am BST    5.21am    The Labor campaign is preparing for tonight\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate. Scott Morrison was asked about how he was feeling about the debate at his press conference and said:  My approach is not to lock myself away in rooms before having these things.   (That\u2019s about Anthony Albanese taking the afternoon off to prepare). Morrison then said he hoped the debate \u201cwill be a civil discussion\u201d.  Updated at 5.23am BST    5.12am    At least some candidates are still talking about issues like the climate crisis:   Updated at 5.14am BST    5.05am    The Public Interest Journalism Initiative has taken a look at the local government areas which don\u2019t have any local news outlets. You can find that map here     4.54am    And if you are in NSW, here is what you need to know: (via AAP) Rule changes from 6pm Friday April 22  Close contacts don\u2019t need to isolate as long as they\u2019re symptom-free. But for seven days, they must stay away from aged care, hospitals, disability services and correctional facilities. They also need to wear a mask indoors, take daily RATs if leaving the house, work from home where possible, and avoid vulnerable people. Vaccine mandates for key workforces are lifted, but staff in aged care and disability services still need to be vaccinated.  Rule changes from April 30:  No quarantine for unvaccinated international returning travellers, but they must take a RAT within 24 hours of arrival Public transport capacity caps are lifted  Rules remaining in NSW:  People who test positive to Covid-19 need to isolate at home for seven days Masks required on public transport, planes, indoors at airports, and cruise terminals.   Updated at 5.04am BST    4.53am    In Victoria and want to know what Covid restrictions are changing come Saturday morning (or 11.59pm Friday to be exact)? AAP has a handy dot point list:  Close contacts don\u2019t need to quarantine for seven days, as long as they wear a mask indoors, avoid \u201csensitive\u201d settings and have at least five negative rapid tests over seven days Vaccination mandates and check-ins for venues scrapped Masks no longer required in primary schools, early childhood, hospitality, retail settings, or at any event Hospital visitor restrictions lifted but masks still required No testing for symptom-free international travellers on arrival, although it\u2019s still recommended No quarantine for unvaccinated travellers People who have Covid-19 are exempt from testing or quarantining for 12 weeks post-infection, rather than eight weeks  Rules remaining in Victoria:  People who test positive still need to isolate at home for seven days Visitor restrictions in care facilities - residents can have up to five visitors a day if they show a negative RAT or two visitors if no test is provided Masks on public transport, airports, sensitive health, aged care and justice settings Vaccine mandates for specific workforces such as healthcare, food distribution, emergency services and education   Updated at 5.02am BST    4.42am    Here is what the prime minister had to say about a Chinese military base on the Solomon Islands:  The prime minister of the Solomon Islands has made it very clear that they are not accepting of any [military] base in the Solomon Islands. They are not. So that is a false claim. That there is no basis to make that assertion. It\u2019s just not there. That would be the first point that I would make.  Perhaps he should tell his deputy?  Updated at 4.47am BST    4.36am   Barnaby Joyce says Solomon Islands potentially 'our own little Cuba'  Barnaby Joyce has also broken government ranks in his description of the security pact between China and Solomon Islands.  Solomon Islands is a sovereign nation. They\u2019ve decided to have a pact with China, dual purpose, which means China is able, if they follow through, to set up a military base there. That will be, absolutely, that\u2019s a very bad day for Australia. We don\u2019t want our own little Cuba off our coast. That is not what is good for this nation. Not what is good for the region.   Updated at 4.45am BST    4.32am    For at least the second time, Barnaby Joyce has claimed that building coal mines in Australia will halt China\u2019s growing influence in the Pacific region. His reasoning is coal makes money and money means nuclear submarines. (I am not making this up) Joyce, speaking in Queensland said:  If you want to buy fighter planes or nuclear submarines, you got (to have) the cash in the bank to do it.  And his money making solution was again developing more coal mines \u201cto make more money\u201d.  So what are we doing? No point everyone saying, \u201cWell, we must do something about it.\u201d All the way through we say, \u201cHow do we become as strong as possible, as quickly as possible? \u201cWell, we develop the Pilbara and that\u2019s what you saw this the budget, money into the Pilbara, make money where we earn money so we can make more money so we can become more secure so if you want to buy a fighter planes or nuclear submarines, you got the cash in the bank to do it.  This ignores international markets beginning to transition away from coal and international financiers moving to renewable energy.   Updated at 4.38am BST    4.24am    AAP has a treasury update: The departments of treasury and finance believe the Australian economy remains strong despite significant global headwinds, including widespread inflation and the war in Ukraine. Department secretaries Steven Kennedy and Rosemary Huxtable signed off on pre-election economic and fiscal outlook (PEFO) on Wednesday, as part of the charter of budget honesty that was introduced by former Liberal treasurer, Peter Costello.  Their independent assessment of the federal government\u2019s financial books has proved to be little different from the budget handed down by treasurer Josh Frydenberg last month. \u201cThe economic and fiscal outlook has not materially changed since the publication of the 2022/23 Budget,\u201d PEFO says. \u201cWhile there has been recent movement in some economic indicators, taking into account all available information, our judgement is that these have not materially altered the economic and fiscal outlook.\u201d PEFO\u2019s forecast for the deficit for the 2021/22 financial year was $79.8bn, the same as in the budget, but for 2022/23 it is now fractionally smaller at $77.9bn compared with $78bn in the budget. Further out, the deficit for 2025/26 is now $42.9bn rather than $43.1bn, while other deficit projections were unchanged. The report estimates policy decisions taken since the budget amount to $1.3bn, although these were partly offset by the reversal of a number of decisions previously taken but not yet announced. The contingency reserve has reduced since the budget by $338.4m over the four years to 2025/25, which includes a partial drawdown of the provision for the potential costs of the long-term response to the February-March floods in parts of NSW and Queensland .  Economic forecasts for growth, unemployment, inflation and wages in PEFO were the same as in the budget. These include 2022/23 predictions of economic growth of 3.5% in 2022/23, an unemployment rate of 3.75%, inflation at three per cent and wage growth of 3.25%. \u201cAs an energy and food exporter with very limited direct trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine, Australia is relatively well positioned to weather the effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine,\u201d PEFO says. It says the recent record prices for key export commodities will boost Australia\u2019s income in the near term, although elevated global oil prices are flowing through to higher petrol and other consumer prices.  \u201cWhile markets expect interest rates to normalise in coming years, materially higher household and business cash savings than at the start of the pandemic are expected to see domestic demand remain resilient,\u201d it says.

Updated at 3.34am BST    3.45am   The view from Murph  We can keep this brief. There has been a lot of talk prior to the election about whether or not Anthony Albanese can find the extra gear necessary to best Scott Morrison in a political campaign, which is one of the prime minister\u2019s core strengths.  The two leaders will meet tonight for the first leaders; debate of the campaign.  Albanese this morning reached for that extra gear, firing up about aged care to sketch a contrast between himself and his opponent \u2013 the Labor leader\u2019s implicit pitch was I care, that bloke doesn\u2019t.   Given this morning\u2019s Guardian Essential poll shows Morrison remains in negative territory when it comes to voter approval, it\u2019s a salient pitch, and this is a tempo he\u2019ll need to sustain tonight because what this morning\u2019s poll also tells us is voter disapproval of Albanese is up five points in a fortnight (which is a negative movement outside the poll\u2019s margin of error). The press pack travelling with Morrison was fired up today, and the prime minister was on the back foot about a significant regional security failure in the Pacific and whether or not nuclear submarines will ever be built in Australia given our lack of a domestic nuclear industry.  Unlike 2019, Morrison continues to be dogged by his record in this campaign. He\u2019s trying to keep ahead of his baggage, but thus far, the baggage is shadowing him, stride for stride.  Updated at 4.20am BST    3.44am    Marise Payne spoke to ABC radio AM host Sabra Lane this morning about the security pact between the Solomon Islands and China and why she didn\u2019t go herself to the Solomon Islands. Sky News political editor Andrew Clennell reported on the day Zed Seselja left, Payne was at a fundraiser. Payne:   I spoke at length and engaged at length with my colleague, minister Manele. The prime minister has been in contact with prime minister Sogavare, including through correspondence. And, of course, minister Seselja, who is our minister for the Pacific, visited as soon as he was able to, having experienced Covid just before that. So, we have been in very close contact with the government of the Solomon Islands ultimately based on our respect for the sovereignty of Solomon Islands. And there have been multiple engagements, including across the region.  SL: But still, you didn\u2019t go personally. The shadow minister Penny Wong says despite all of his tough talk, Scott Morrison\u2019s watch on our region has become less secure. How do you respond? Payne:   I think that\u2019s an unfair characterisation. And I don\u2019t think it recognises the sovereign decisions that governments, of course, make for themselves. And it also doesn\u2019t recognise the strength and the engagement that Australia has made through the Pacific step-up. We are looking at very serious geostrategic challenges in our region. And they are realities. We deal with them across the region broadly, as I\u2019ve already mentioned. But in terms of our bilateral relationship with the Solomon Islands, we are by far their largest development partner, and we\u2019re very proud to work and engage with the Solomon Islands on a range of issues. The Covid-19 response is one example.   Updated at 3.55am BST    3.37am    The Greens are calling on the Coalition to urgently step in to help the more than 13,000 Aboriginal people who have lost thousands of dollars after their funeral fund, Youpla/ACBF went into liquidation last month.As we reported yesterday, Aboriginal families in at least two states have been forced to leave the bodies of their loved ones in morgues because they can\u2019t afford a funeral, after the financial collapse of their insurer, which has previously been exposed for its \u201cmisleading and deceptive\u201d conduct. The collapse last month of Youpla Group has sparked calls for compensation for the more than 13,000 low-income Aboriginal people who face losing all they have paid into the funeral fund.Labor has said if it wins government it will set up an inquiry into the collapse, while the Morrison government has dismissed calls for compensation. But Greens senator Lidia Thorpe says Aboriginal families are in urgent need of assistance.   We struggle to survive in this country, and we can\u2019t even rest in peace. Our family members are being left in morgues while the community saves for sorry business, or they face being buried as paupers! It\u2019s devastating.\u201d The Coalition allowed Youpla Group to continue to trade and target First Nations people. This government\u2019s failure to regulate the industry has caused these losses, they have a duty to compensate policyholders. This is about dignity. This is about respect. This could be resolved by a government, who seem to have no trouble bailing out their mining and corporate mates. The hypocrisy of this government, to facilitate the ongoing loss and pain in our communities is a national shame.  Before the government went into caretaker mode, the minister for financial services, Jane Hume, said people could apply for a state-assisted funeral, commonly known in the industry as a \u201cdestitute\u201d or \u201cpauper\u201d funeral.  Updated at 3.47am BST    3.31am    Well that was quite the morning. Both campaigns will go a little quiet now, as they prepare for the first leaders\u2019 debate tonight. That is being broadcast on Sky, so it won\u2019t be shown on free-to-air.  Updated at 3.35am BST    3.16am    Further to Murph\u2019s story.  The ACL has released this statement: This week, the Australian Christian Lobby launches its national election campaign, powered by an army of 7,700 active volunteers. The purpose of the campaign is to highlight the record of certain MPs and senators \u2013 both good and bad \u2013 with a special focus on those who refused to protect people of faith from discrimination and tried to severely compromise Christian schooling. We ask the question of voters, \u201cDo their attacks on faith accord with your values?\u201d The truth about these candidates will be spread in target electorates through multiple flyers, digital ads, phone canvassing, billboards, and more. The Australian Christian Lobby\u2019s campaigning activities come off the back of new survey results revealing that thousands of local voters are yet to learn the truth about these Liberal rebels. The survey of 4,063 voters in the Liberal-held seats of Bass (Bridget Archer), North Sydney (Trent Zimmerman), Reid (Fiona Martin), Wentworth (Dave Sharma) and the independent seat of Mayo (Rebekah Sharkie) found 49% were unaware of the role played by their MPs in ending a bid to protect religious Australians from discrimination. ACL Managing Director Martyn Iles said:  These survey results mean there are still thousands of Christian voters who need to hear the truth about their MPs. I urge Christians to take the time to learn the truth about each of the candidates and understand where they stand on the important issues of religious freedom and protections for Christian schools. This campaign is blind to party colours. Rather, it sees individuals and their voting record. When the election is over, whichever party wins, it is our hope that more individual parliamentarians from all parties will stand up for faith communities and the protection of Christian schools.   Updated at 3.39am BST    3.13am    There\u2019s been an effort by the Morrison government over the past day to challenge Labor about the costs of its plans to accelerate the decarbonisation of the power sector (see Adam Morton\u2019s pieces here and here). However, whoever forms government from 21 May, Australia\u2019s power sector needs urgent attention as ageing coal plants near the end of their (often shortened) design lives. The latest evidence comes today from AGL Energy, the largest electricity generator, which said a quarter of its 2.215 gigawatt Loy Yang A power plant will be offline after an electrical fault that it\u2019s still investigating.  AGL expects to update the market by the first week of May on how long its Unit 2 will be offline. As we noted earlier this week, wholesale electricity prices have soared in recent months, in part because of the closure of coal plant capacity \u2013 and are double the level touted in the recent federal budget for most of the national electricity market:  AGL\u2019s announcement will nudge power prices higher, particularly in Victoria, where Loy Yang A is the biggest single plant.  Updated at 3.18am BST    3.12am   'Don't send text messages': Dom Perrottet on PM text message leak  NSW premier Dominic Perrottet says he is unaware of how a text message exchange between him and Scott Morrison was leaked to the media. The Australian has reported that Perrottet texted Morrison to express support for him standing by the Liberal party\u2019s controversial candidate for the seat of Warringah.  Katherine Deves has come under fierce internal criticism over her comments on transgender issues and women\u2019s sports. Perrottet told reporters he did not know how the text message had been obtained by The Australian:  The moral of the story is don\u2019t send text messages.  He also played down differences with NSW treasurer Matt Kean who has called for Deves to be disendorsed:  Matt has a view in relation to the candidate and the way she\u2019s expressed those positions. Now, I actually agree with Matt on that point ... when you are dealing with issues that are delicate, it\u2019s incredibly important that we are sensitive in our language and when we are sensitive when we are engaging in those discussions.   Updated at 3.19am BST    3.09am   Guide Dogs Victoria investigates CEO endorsement of Josh Frydenberg  Khaled AlKhawaldeh and Josh Butler have a story on this coming in just a moment \u2013 but they have sent through a blog post because they know you don\u2019t like to wait: Guide Dogs Victoria has asked treasurer Josh Frydenberg to stop circulating election flyers featuring an endorsement from its CEO, with the charity saying it had \u201cno prior knowledge\u201d of the ad. Guide Dogs VIC chair Iain Edwards said the organisation had launched an investigation, saying it was \u201cabsolutely committed to its important work as a charitable apolitical organisation\u201d. Frydenberg has recently been sharing ads and flyers featuring endorsements from local community members, as he faces a stiff challenge from independent Monique Ryan in his Victorian seat of Kooyong. One such ad, featuring Guide Dogs VIC CEO Karen Hayes, has been distributed to letterboxes and is being boosted with paid Facebook ads.  In the Facebook ad, Hayes praises the treasurer as an \u201camazing supporter\u201d of the organisation, for which she was \u201cenormously grateful\u201d. On the flyer, Hayes said he has \u201cgenuine care\u201d for Guide Dogs VIC and that her has \u201cdelivered in so many ways\u201d for his electorate. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Edwards said Guide Dogs VIC wasn\u2019t aware of the ad.  Guide Dogs Victoria has been made aware of the distribution of political material which includes comments from our CEO who appears to endorse a local candidate in the upcoming federal election. The board of Guide Dogs Victoria fully understands the concerns that have been raised by members of the community and from our supporters about this matter,\u201d he said. The board has launched an internal investigation and requested that this material be immediately removed from circulation. We will make no further comment during this process. The board had no prior knowledge of the distribution of this material and does not endorse it.\u201d  Guardian Australia has contacted Frydenberg for comment.    Updated at 3.24am BST    3.07am   'We\u2019re not going to have a submissive relationship with China': Morrison  Q: What is your red line for China\u2019s presence in our region? Scott Morrison:  Well, we will always stand up for Australia\u2019s national interests and call out coercion and interference from China wherever it occurs. Now, I know that has meant that Australia has been the target of China\u2019s coercion.  We\u2019ve been the target of a nation that is seeking to exert its influence in our area, which is in Australia\u2019s interest. But I\u2019m often asked this question.  Why is Australia so forward-leaning when it comes to China? Because if not us, then who? Who has the most to lose in our region, if Australia were not to stand up? Australians would.  And that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been shy about it. I haven\u2019t been intimidated, whether it was knocking back the Kidman property sale when I was the treasurer, or ensuring that appropriate arrangements were put in place to protect Australia through our national defences, or calling out China, which is where the pandemic started, and the many issues that flowed on from that.  We\u2019ve always stood up to China because it\u2019s in our interests. Now, we would like to have a very positive relationship but we\u2019re not going to have a submissive relationship with China and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the interests of Pacific nations to have a submissive nature with China, any more than it is to have a submissive relationship with Australia, and we\u2019re not [suggesting] that. We have a partnership of equals with our neighbours and when prime minister Ardern and I addressed these issues in the Pacific, we both understand that and share an approach to how we deal with issues in the Pacific. And we\u2019ve discussed this issue, Jacinda and I, many times. And the approach we\u2019ve taken, as the larger economies in the Pacific theatre, is to respect and engage and not seek to throw the weight of large countries around.    Updated at 3.30am BST    3.05am    Q: Can you guarantee 100% that the fleets under the Aukus agreement will be built in Australia, will they be built here in Adelaide? Scott Morrison:  As much as possible will be built here in Australia. Now, we haven\u2019t down selected even the vessel that will be made. So no one can respond to that question in the way you would like them to. The other point I\u2019d make about Aukus is this. Aukus is not just about Australia having nuclear-powered submarines. Aukus is about Australia being able to produce them. Because in the United States and in the UK, they are both making lots of nuclear-powered submarines.  They want another partner making nuclear-powered submarines. Now, obviously, the reactors and things that are directly related to the nuclear elements of those programs obviously have to be done in other places, but our agreement, our discussions are about maximising what can be done in Australia, because that is in the shared national security interests of the three partners to Aukus. So the point of Aukus is not just to have this capability, but to be able to build and develop that capability right here in South Australia.    Updated at 3.34am BST    3.02am    Scott Morrison: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to yell. So why don\u2019t we all take the temperature down and ask your questions.\u201d Q: No one is arguing against the merits of the various projects under the Step-Up and infrastructure facility, but the record says this: two countries have switched their allegiance from Taiwan to China in the time that we have had this Step-Up. We now have this security agreement which could pave the way for a Chinese defence base in the Solomon Islands. What\u2019s the evidence that the Step-Up has worked in any way? Where is the soft power win? Hasn\u2019t been nothing but failure? Morrison:  First of all, I\u2019d say this: the prime minister of the Solomon Islands has made it very clear that they are not accepting of any base in the Solomon Islands. They are not. So that is a false claim.  That there is no basis to make that assertion. It\u2019s just not there. That would be the first point that I would make.  What I would also point to is the work we have done within the Pacific Islands Forum on so many areas of their economic development, Papua New Guinea is a very good example. Do you think there\u2019s not the same pressure going on in Papua New Guinea that there is in the Solomon Islands? Of course there is.     You don\u2019t think the same pressure is put in place on Fiji or Samoa or that\u2019s happening in all of those countries. We keep re-enforcing to all our our Pacific family that will always be there for you in your interests and that is what we believe will ultimately prevail. Now, there are lots of pressures and we\u2019re not dismissing those.  I mean, when Anthony Albanese was asked about this, he thought this issue was about ... only three things \u2013 climate change, climate change and climate change*.  That\u2019s a nonsense. China has the biggest emissions and growing emissions in the world. So they haven\u2019t \u2013 they may have just woken up to the issue. They have been highly critical of our government and me and the strong stand that I have taken against China. But what these issues highlight is the risk, the uncertainty and the fact that you need to be constant in your relations with all these Pacific countries.  The Pacific Step-Up was not a one or two-year program. It is an ongoing arrangement to demonstrate to the Pacific that, you know, we\u2019re going to engage with you over the long-term ... and [not treat] Pacific Islanders as some sort of colony, which was the impression they used to have.  Now, we have been turning that around and you make the point about Taiwan and Beijing. The Australian government recognises Beijing over Taiwan. What hypocrisy would there be from Australia to lecture a Pacific Island nation to make a decision that the Australian government has made. I mean, that would be the height of hypocrisy and the height of arrogance and there\u2019s one thing that does not characterise the way I deal with Pacific leaders. I treat them with respect and I respect their sovereignty and I respect their electoral mandates. *Here\u2019s what Pacific leaders have said in the past about Australia and climate change:    Updated at 4.04am BST    3.00am    Q: The point that this hasn\u2019t come as a surprise. How were you informed that the deal was finalised? Have you spoken to Manasseh Sogavare in the last 24 hours? And given that you say this has been an ongoing issue, doesn\u2019t that just show Australia has become complacent and that China has done a better job on the diplomatic front? Scott Morrison:  No, I don\u2019t think you can draw that conclusion. I think, again, what this highlights is that over the last five years in particular, the level of interference and the level of engagement and particularly, you know, with all sorts of promises of all sorts of investments that can be very persuasive.  And so that is the challenge that we\u2019re now dealing with and we have been dealing with it for many years.  It is not a new issue and these threats still remain. I speak to other Pacific leaders about it all the time and what we reassure them about is you can\u2019t always be fully persuasive on these issues.  What I assured them about is that Australia will be there for you as we always are, not because we want anything from you, but because we see the Pacific as our family and we want to stand by our family and be sure that they can have the sovereignty that they have earned, that they believe in very strongly.  And we want to support them in that. And so the Solomon Islands government, through a duly-elected prime minister and cabinet, have made a decision that they are allowed to make. Of course, they are. They\u2019re a sovereign country and we have to respect their sovereignty so now with this arrangement, we need to ensure we work with them to see that Australia\u2019s interests aren\u2019t compromised because we believe in our interests, that their strength and their sovereignty is not compromised by these types of arrangements and that\u2019s why I sent the national security officials to go and provide a briefing to the prime minister as I did to a number of other leaders in the region.  Now, I can\u2019t go into the reasons as to why I am aware of whether agreements have been reached or not, that is not appropriate in terms of how the Australian government operates.   Updated at 3.10am BST    2.59am    Those questions continue: Q: Why was it not important enough for a cabinet minister to go? Scott Morrison:  As I said before, in the Pacific, one of the things you got to be very, very cognisant of is there is a long history of frankly countries like Australia and even New Zealand and others coming around and treating Pacific Islands like they should be doing what the big countries should tell them to do.  You have asked me the question about why this is important. Now I had a lot of experience in this area and I have dealt with Pacific countries for a long time including before I went into parliament. One of the things you don\u2019t do in the Pacific is you don\u2019t throw your weight around. What you do is you treat others respectfully. I\u2019m very conscious of how visits are perceived within the Pacific. This was the right calibrated way to address this issue with the prime minister. I have had discussions with the prime minister personally about these issues. I have spoken to Manasseh Sogavare on many occasion, many, many occasions, as I talk to Pacific leaders all the time and particularly about this issue. So the judgement was made to ensure that Australia\u2019s views were communicated very clearly and very respectfully and that has been done. And this is an ongoing issue. That secret agreement that the Solomon Islands\u2019 prime minister was very determined to resolve it, there is a lot of influence going on in the Pacific and a lot of pressure placed on other Pacific countries and our region and what they need to understand is that I am going to work with them. I\u2019m not going to act like former administrations that treated the Pacific like some extension of Australia. The Pacific Islands are very sensitive to that and I have always had an approach with the Pacific Islands which understands those sensitivities because there is a lot at stake.    Updated at 4.09am BST    2.58am    Q: Two questions. The first is on the very day that Zed Seselja was travelling to the Solomon Islands, Marise Payne was hosting a private fundraiser at PwC Barangaroo. Is that really the best use of the foreign minister at that time as opposed to going to the Solomons? My second question relates to boat turnbacks. How many have your government done and how many have Labor done? Scott Morrison:  We have done 27 turnbacks from memory and Labor did none. Labor did none. And I remember this very vividly because I was the shadow minister for immigration and border protection at the time. Labor did everything they could possibly do to avoid restoring temporary protection visas, ultimately for many years, to restore offshore processing which they finally relented on too late, and sent actual kids and put them on Manus Island, and, thirdly, they just refused to do turnbacks.  Now, the policy I put together prior to the 2013 election with my team, with many others, with the great support of Tony Abbott, enabled us to be ready when we were elected to go and deal with that problem. We have worked on a plan, we have done the hard work in opposition to come forward with a plan that was going to deal with one of the most significant national security issues that were being dealt with at that time and we implemented it and it worked. And so the real test of whether you support something or not is when it really mattered and the Labor party and Anthony Albanese opposed all of those measures for so long and they demonised those who sought to put them in place.  Q: And Marise Payne? Morrison:  Look, I already answered the question. We were very aware of where that agreement was up to, as were all other Pacific leaders, it was very important that we communicated very clearly to the prime minister of the Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, what the Australian government\u2019s position was. And to do that at that level made very clear that Australia was not looking to go and stamp around, that we were going to deal with it constructively and respectfully.  Q: Zed Seselja doesn\u2019t. How does that work? Morrison:  The foreign minister is a different level to the minister of Pacific. One is in cabinet, one is not. You calibrate your diplomacy to deal with sensitive issues.   Updated at 3.26am BST    2.55am   Morrison says he won't allow people to 'cancel' Katherine Deves  Q: To the mental health of young people and driving down suicide rates, you\u2019re standing by a candidate who has potentially caused more harm than good to gender diverse and trans young people. Aren\u2019t you concerned that\u2019s doing more harm than good? And on a second note - it\u2019s been revealed that the candidate for Cooper is noted to attend far-right rallies, an active member of Clive Palmer fans Facebook group and once described ex-Queensland Senator Fraser Anning as a God. Why are you standing by him? Scott Morrison:  To the first point you raised and I have raised this many times in these press conferences - the remarks that Katherine has made in the past that have been [insensitive] that she\u2019s withdrawn those remarks and I think she has learned that in taking forward the primary issue that she is seeking to raise as a woman raising three daughters of her own is about women and girls in sport. That\u2019s what she\u2019s seeking to bring attention to.  Reporters interject Morrison:  I haven\u2019t finished my answer. You can wait until I finish my answer.  Reporters interject again Morrison:  Women in sport is the issue that Katherine has been highlighting. She\u2019s made a number of remarks in the past, and on a number of occasions, not in the majority, she\u2019s stepped over the line, and she\u2019s acknowledged that. To go forward as a member of Parliament, that is something you need to learn. That these issues are important, that you need to be able to deal with them with respect for others, to be compassionate in terms of the feelings of others.  But what I won\u2019t allow, what I won\u2019t allow, is for those who are seeking to cancel Katherine simply because she has a different view to them on the issue of women and girls in sport.  I\u2019m not going to indulge that because you know in this country, I think Australians...  Reporters interject again. Morrison:  I think Australians are getting pretty fed-up with having to walk on egg shells everyday because they may or may not say something one day that\u2019s going to upset someone*. Now you shouldn\u2019t seek to upset anyone else, you shouldn\u2019t seek to upset people, you should deal with things in a very sensitive way, but in this country, I think it\u2019s time to allow - allow people where they have made mistakes in the past about how they have said things in the past, where they\u2019re prepared to put those behind them, and focus sensitively on the issues they\u2019re seeking to promote, then that\u2019s how they do it. Others might want to cancel her, others might want to cancel other Australians for standing up for things that they believe in but I am not going to be in partnership with them.  *A reminder Peter Dutton sued over a deleted twitter comment and the government has legislation it has dressed up as making social media safer, but really makes it easier for people to launch defamation action    Updated at 3.27am BST    2.51am   Morrison says China push in the Pacific is 'no surprise'  Q: Prime minister, why was Marise Payne not sent to Solomon Islands the minute the government knew this deal was coming to a head? And is it a failure of your Pacific step-up program? Scott Morrison:  No, I think \u2013 no, absolutely not.  Q: Why not. Morrison:  This is highlighting the very real issue that we have been working on for many, many years. This is no surprise to us. It may be a surprise to the Labor party, but it\u2019s not a surprise to us. I mean, the Labor party has been very passive when it comes to the risk presented by China in our region.  They have been very critical of the government, they have been very critical of me personally in the strong stand that I have taken in relation to China\u2019s influence, not just in Australia, but across the Pacific.  I mean, I was the one who went to the G7 and tabled those items of the coercion that Australia is facing. Australia is being coerced by China because of the strong stand that our government has taken. So this is not a new issue.  It is not a new issue for my government, for our government. It\u2019s a very serious issue and that\u2019s why, particularly during the course of the pandemic, I\u2019ll tell you what happened with Fiji, for example: with Fiji, we were the country that ensured they could vaccinate their entire population. And when China sought to send their vaccines to Fiji, the Fijian government was able to say, \u201cNo, thank you. The Australians have got us covered.\u201d Now, I have been working closely with all of those political leaders because as a family, you deal with the security threats that arise from this secret agreement with China and I know that is a great concern to other members of the Pacific family.  I mean, I know what Kevin Rudd said, he thought foreign ministers should be sent up there to stomp around and tell Pacific Islanders what to do. That was the failed approach of the past. What I have done as prime minister is taken a very different approach.  Personally engaging with these leaders, constantly, and ensuring that we talk through the challenges that they have, particularly during the pandemic. We were the country that stepped up most for our Pacific family and reminded other large countries in the world about the needs in the Pacific area and that is respected in the Pacific.   Updated at 3.58am BST    2.48am    Q: Prime Minister, you said no major changes to the BOOT. What changes to the BOOT are you considering making? And does it include the proposal in the omnibus IR bill that would have allowed businesses hard hit by the pandemic to reach agreements that aren\u2019t subject...? Scott Morrison:  The pandemic is now passed. I mean - the pandemic passed. There are emergency measures that obviously no longer have an application, we\u2019re not in an economic emergency environment. And so the measures that I have already articulated to you and that are set out well in the legislation, I think, are very clear. But the scare campaign Labor is seeking to run on this is not unlike the one they\u2019re running on pensions. If you don\u2019t have an economic plan, you go and raise false scare campaigns against your opponents*. So every time you hear Labor make these claims, it\u2019s an admission by them that they have no economic plan.  *Does this include the \u2018re-start the boat campaign David Littleproud said was a scare campaign the Coalition is running?     2.46am    Scott Morrison continues that:  This is a very serious issue and I ask you to show some patience as I step through the important issues around this issue.  Now, Senator Seselja, I\u2019m pleased he was able to go and the campaign was already underway prior to Senator Seselja\u2019s visit. I also sent very senior members of our national security officials team to go and meet not just in the Solomon Islands, but to brief other countries in the Pacific.  I have been in regular contact with [Fijian] prime minister Frank Bainimarama who is the leader of the Pacific Island Forum and there is strong concern across the Pacific and with allies and partners, particularly the United States, about where this is heading. But it only underscores and highlights the reason for the actions we have been taking for many years.  And let me run you through some of those actions. Our development program in the Solomon Islands, some $161.2 million in 2021-22. It covers areas of health, economic recovery, education. We have the largest development partner in the Solomon Islands partnering around two-thirds of all assistance.  We provided $1.85 billion in development assistance to the Pacific \u2013 that\u2019s our budget for next year. That is up from $1.12 billion when Labor was last in office. We have invested in the undersea cable project to ensure the security of their communications network in the region. We got $30 million going through the Pacific finance facility that we put in place.  And so all the way through we work respectfully with these countries, and they know that Australia is a great friend. Australia remains their first port of call because we have AFP officers on the ground right now.  The first place they called was Australia. And so we will continue to work respectfully with the Solomon Islands. I look forward to making a visit there at the first opportunity. As you rightly said it was the first place I went to, and with Covid, it has been difficult to travel in the region, but we have ensured we have continued to do that and I have seen Pacific leaders very, very regularly.   Updated at 3.35am BST    2.45am   Scott Morrison defends Solomon Islands response  Q: Did you make a mistake sending Zed Seselja to the Solomon Islands? And if you\u2019re re-elected on May 21, will the Solomon Islands be one of your first visits as PM as it was when you became PM in 2018? And what do you think about the deal that\u2019s been signed? Scott Morrison:  Well, this is a very serious issue and it comes as what has occurred in the Solomon Islands - and it comes as no surprise to our government. As you rightly said, after the last election, the first place I went was to the Solomon Islands to sit down with prime minister Sogavare.  Over the course of these last three years, I have spent an enormous amount of time working with all the Pacific leaders, stepping up in our Pacific Step-Up because the real risk, I think, has been exposed.  The risk of China seeking to interfere within our region. I have known about and have been taking strong action about. I mean, I was the one who stood up and called out China on the pandemic. I was the one who called out their interference.  I was the one who did all of this and \u2013 and I was the one criticised for it, including by the Labor party.  So I\u2019m pleased the Labor party are catching up on this issue, but what this demonstrates is the very real risk that we have been aware of \u2013 that is why I have spent countless hours in meetings with Pacific Island leaders, particularly more recently when this particular arrangement came to light, working with the prime minister of New Zealand in particular.  New Zealand and Australia worked very carefully in these issues and one of the things we strongly agree on and how we handle this issue within our Pacific family, you know, we\u2019re siblings, they\u2019re not children and adults in that relationship.  We treat the Pacific family as siblings and as family and our view is very much that you don\u2019t go around stomping around telling leaders in Pacific Islands what they should and shouldn\u2019t do. You work with them respectfully and carefully. Now, Senator Seselja ...  Journalists begin shouting questions.   Updated at 3.16am BST    2.42am    Q: You said on Saturday that you remain committed to omnibus reforms even the ones that didn\u2019t pass the parliament, including those reforms of the two-year pause and more modest changes to the Boot for the long term, taking into account non-monetary benefits and things of that nature. Now, Michaelia Cash is saying that there\u2019ll be no pause to the Boot. Is that a backflip from Saturday? And is the policy either longer term or modest changes to the Boot still your policy? Scott Morrison:  Well, the legislation, which as you know, was practical, common sense changes. It was an award simplification, it was the greenfield arrangements that I mentioned yesterday when we were in Western Australia, it\u2019s about simplification and ensuring that there\u2019s greater flexibility to ensure that these companies can work with what is an often complex industrial relations system which costs jobs, costs higher wages, and it costs the Australian economy and our policies were set out, as I was asked about this on the weekend, and there are no major changes to the Boot at all.  Even on the greenfields program, I mean, this is something Bill Shorten supported and Anthony Albanese can\u2019t.  So I\u2019m not surprised that there\u2019s another scare campaign from Labor. Labor running a scare campaign now, yesterday, it was telling pensioners we were coming to apply the cashless debit card \u2013 an out and out lie.  Just like the lies we had from Mediscare back in 2016 saying we were going to sell off Medicare. Now, that didn\u2019t happen. We took Medicare from 82.2% bulk-billing to 88.8%.  The budget is now $31.4bn and so what this has demonstrated is Labor lies in campaigns. They try and scare people. Now, let me tell you why they want to do that. If after three years you still haven\u2019t come up with an economic plan and they have had plenty of time to do that, and they can\u2019t! So what do they do?  They run scare campaigns against the government. That\u2019s what happens with Labor in election campaigns. Our policies are very clearly set out.  Labor is opposed to another important part of that program which was actually protecting casualisation, protecting workers involved in casual jobs. It was also their very serious penalties dealing with wage theft.  The Labor party said it was collateral damage. The Labor party were more interested in having some political win against the government rather than protecting the jobs of Australians, be they casuals or protecting Australians from wage theft, they were happy to sell them out for a cheap political win in the parliament.   Updated at 2.51am BST    2.35am   Scott Morrison press conference  Scott Morrison is in Boothby (Adelaide) where the Liberal MP Nicolle Flint is retiring. Labor always thinks it can get Boothby, but the electorate has voted Liberal pretty much since it was formed. Morrison is talking manufacturing and coming through the pandemic and not being able to trust Labor.     2.23am    Household contacts of positive Covid-19 cases in New South Wales will no longer need to isolate for seven days as part of sweeping changes to pandemic restrictions in the state. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet on Wednesday announced from Friday 6pm, close contacts of a positive case will not be required to isolate if they do not have symptoms.  But close contacts must wear a face mask in indoor public settings, avoid contact with elderly and immunocompromised people, work from home where possible and undergo daily rapid antigen tests before coming into contact with people outside their household. Perrottet said the removing of restrictions did not signal the end of the pandemic:  We will always tailor our restrictions, as we\u2019ve said from the outset, to the circumstances we find ourselves in.  Perrottett said the state would also cease using hotel quarantine and scrap government imposed health mandates for most businesses. Restrictions remain the same for Covid positive cases. Victoria is also easing restrictions and scrapping its close contact isolation rule, with the changes to come into effect at 11.59pm on Friday. Close contacts will need to take five rapid antigen tests over a seven-day period.  The state will also end its vaccinated economy, meaning customers will not be required to show proof of two vaccine doses to enter a venue. Staff and patrons will not need to check in using the Services Victoria app at venues. Masks will no longer be required in primary schools, hospitality and retail settings.   Updated at 2.41am BST    2.21am   NSW to drop Covid close contact rule and remove Covid hotel quarantine  NSW premier Dominic Perrottet is announcing NSW\u2019s changes to its Covid public safety measures to come into effect on Friday at 6pm:  Those changes today will include the removal of the seven-day isolation period for close contact. In addition today, we will be moving towards removing hotel quarantine here in our state.  Hotel quarantine has proven to be incredibly successful over the course of the pandemic but from this position we are in now, hotel quarantine will cease, in addition we will also be moving from a government perspective of in relation to mandates and occupational health &amp; safety approach.  All areas of government will take risk-based assessments in relation to their areas of employment and they will make recommendations in relation to where vaccination will be required in their specific areas. Dr Chant will speak to this in certain areas and health where vaccination will be required just as we have had pre-pandemic for various health workers in certain settings. In addition to that as well, today the green dots will be removed from public transport.  So I want to make the point in closing. This is not the end of the pandemic, we will always tailor our restrictions as we have said from the outset over the last two years, from the circumstances that we find ourselves. But today is a day where the people of our state can be incredibly proud to be in a position where we have had an incredibly low death rate.  We have put downward pressure on our health system and that is because of the efforts and sacrifice people have made.    Updated at 2.54am BST    2.16am    Mask mandates remain in critical care settings, as well as aged and disability care. Vaccine mandates remain in place in those same areas.     2.16am    Victorian chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, steps up at the Victorian press conference:  Today is a significant day for all Victorians, not a wholesale change but an appropriate next step in this phase of the management of the pandemic. So from Saturday, it will absolutely focus more on the individual discretion of all of us in the community to make appropriate choices for ourselves, to protect ourselves and protect those around us as we go about our day-to-day lives.  The phase that we\u2019re in now is only possible because of the very high vaccination coverage that we\u2019ve achieved, really astonishing protection for our population. And the many millions who have been vaccinated right through this pandemic, but in particular the third doses that have been given through the course of this year at GPs, pharmacists, state-run centres and all of our community pop-ups, just fantastic work to give us that protection that allows us to be here, making these changes today.  So I want to thank every Victorian, every health worker, every person in our system. I want to thank everyone who has stepped forward to get a test or a vaccine. That collective effort has safeguarded our community and saved literally thousands of Victorian lives.  We\u2019re at a point where 19 out of 20, essentially, 95%, are double vaccinated. We\u2019ve got two-thirds who are triple vaccinated, indeed among those who are eligible \u2013 because some have recently had Covid \u2013 it\u2019s above 70%.  We\u2019ve reached that milestone in just five months. The vaccine rates among older Victorians are even higher. We\u2019ve got 90% coverage for those over 70, 85% for those over 65, 82% for those over 60.  Terrific figures. It means we\u2019re in the best position to make a further easing of restrictions is significant, but it is a sensible one. It will allow us to get back to a better normal, help keep us safe at home at school and at work while we can still respond to the emerging risks.    Updated at 2.57am BST    2.13am    Meanwhile, as Donna Lu and Benita Kolovos report, more people have died in the first four months of this year than in the past two years of the pandemic combined:  The number of deaths from Covid-19 in Australia this year to date has reached more than double the deaths from 2020 and 2021 combined. According to federal health department data as of 18 April, 6,786 people have died of Covid-19 in Australia since the beginning of the pandemic. Of these deaths, 4,547 occurred in 2022 \u2013 more than double the 2,239 deaths recorded over the first two years of the pandemic. NSW and Victoria on track to scrap Covid isolation rules for household contacts within daysRead more Prof Adrian Esterman, a biostatistician at the University of South Australia, said the figures were unsurprising given the high transmission of Covid in recent months. He criticised a relaxation of policies on face masks and social distancing, which he said was sending the message to the general public that the pandemic was over. \u201cUnfortunately, the virus doesn\u2019t know that. We\u2019re still seeing thousands of people being infected; we\u2019re seeing many, many people ending up in hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s no longer an absolute acute emergency like it was, because we have a large percentage of our population vaccinated and we\u2019ve got better treatments. But the fact of the matter is it\u2019s still there. We could still get another variant coming along tomorrow, which is worse than Delta.\u201d       2.10am   Victoria announces Covid health measure changes  Martin Foley is announcing changes to Victoria\u2019s Covid safety measures, to come into effect at 11.59pm on Friday:   So from 11:59pm on Friday, the following changes to the pandemic orders will be made:  People won\u2019t be required to have two doses or show their vaccination status before entering venues.  The requirement for staff and patrons of venues to check-in using the Services Vic app will end and operators will not be required to maintain attendance records or maintain a check-in marshall.  Masks will no longer be required in primary schools, in early childhood settings, or retail settings or events of any size that apply \u2013 greater than 30,000 and a few other locations. Close contacts will no longer have to quarantine, provided that they wear a mask indoors and avoid sensitive settings, and they will also need to carry out five rapid antigen tests over the course of the seven days that they previously would have been in isolation.  Further, all visitor restrictions in hospitals will be removed, except for mask requirements, with health services able to tailor their own settings based on their own circumstances. And we\u2019ve been discussing this matter with health services for some time and we know that they will variously apply continued acceptable restrictions that apply to their particular workforces, patients, and locations. Events with more than 30,000 people will no longer require public health pre-approval.  International travellers who are symptom-free will be recommended, but not required, to undertake PCR or rapid tests on arrival and unvaccinated travellers will no longer complete seven days\u2019 quarantine.  Pre-departure tests for unvaccinated aircrews will also be lifted. People will be exempt from testing or quarantining for 12 weeks if they\u2019ve previously had Covid-19 up from the current eight weeks.  Individuals will be required to notify their workplace contact in addition to informing their social contact. Workplaces won\u2019t have to notify individuals and each potentially exposed worker in an outbreak but they\u2019ll have their general occupational health and safety responsibility for advice to their workplaces.   Updated at 2.55am BST    2.07am    David Littleproud on ABC radio RN Breakfast was also pushed on why the Morrison government didn\u2019t send a more senior minister to the Solomon Islands and had this to say:  What we need now is leadership instead of politics.  (I think that was the point?) So why didn\u2019t we send the most senior person we could?  With respect if the wannabe foreign minister wants to be making inflated comments in a time when what is needed is leadership and calm and to work collaboratively with them to get an understanding before they make derogatory comments about what\u2019s in that agreement, and you shouldn\u2019t jump the gun in foreign diplomacy.  And that should be a lesson even as little agriculture minister, I know that you should do this maturely. You should work through this with your partners and particularly the nation in question before you give any gratuitous advice from the sidelines.  That\u2019s the responsible thing to do. Otherwise, you risk escalating matters. And that\u2019s why we need to do this not only with the United States, but with other Pacific nations and Penny Wong just needs to calm down. We all need to calm down.   Updated at 2.23am BST    2.02am    Consumer confidence really translates into voter confidence during election campaigns, so the weekly survey of sentiment by ANZ and Roy Morgan is worth keeping an eye on. Media chatter about \u201ccost of living pressures\u201d has certainly come off in the weeks since the 29 March federal budget when treasurer Josh Frydenberg halved the fuel excise, lopping 22.1 cents off the per-litre price of petrol and diesel. The six-month \u201celectoral investment\u201d seems to be paying off for now \u2013 helped of course by falling global oil prices from their peaks after the Russians invaded Ukraine. (Fuel prices in NSW, for instance, are under $1.65 per litre today, or about 50 cents off their peaks.) Consumer confidence rose 2.3% last week for a third consecutive weekly gain, dropping only in Queensland among the states.  ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics, David Plank, says sentiment is now at its highest since 6 March, although it remains below the 100-reading so we\u2019re not out of the funk yet.  Oil prices have risen more than 10% from the low at the beginning of last week, so it\u2019s not clear if there is much more room for confidence to be boosted by lower petrol prices.  With lower fuel prices come lower expectations of inflation, so the survey also found:  That will be heartening for the Reserve Bank which has been in no hurry to raise its cash rate target. As we noted yesterday here, the central bank\u2019s minutes show it still wants to see more data \u201cover coming months\u201d before lifting rates. Investors don\u2019t expect the RBA\u2019s May meeting to see the target raised from its record low 0.1%, but they do expect the June gathering to kick them off.   In other words, higher rates and higher petrol prices once the excise level is restored seem safely over the post-election horizon as far as the Morrison government is concerned.  Updated at 2.09am BST    1.44am    After taking months of hits from Peter Dutton on Labor\u2019s defence record, Brendan O\u2019Connor is turning the focus back to government decisions, as Daniel Hurst reports, following an interview with the would-be defence minister: Labor will consider reinstating a $1.3bn program for Australia to acquire armed drones if it wins the election, vowing to review the Coalition\u2019s \u201cbewildering\u201d decision to scrap it \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. The shadow defence minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said he was concerned there was a \u201cvery significant capability gap in the immediate future\u201d, and he would seek detailed advice after the election. In a wide-ranging interview, O\u2019Connor also raised \u201csystemic\u201d problems with the delivery of defence projects and promised more stringent oversight if appointed minister.   Updated at 1.59am BST    1.41am    Daniel Hurst has sent me the White House statement on the Solomon Islands-China security pact:  On April 18, National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink convened a meeting in Honolulu with U.S. Navy Adm. John C. Aquilino, Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and senior officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand on developments in the Pacific Islands. In Honolulu, the officials reaffirmed the four countries\u2019 enduring and shared commitment to the Pacific Islands.  The United States resolved to intensify its engagement in the region to meet 21st-century challenges, from maritime security and economic development to the climate crisis and COVID-19. We will do this in ever-closer partnership with Pacific Island nations, including through a united Pacific Islands Forum; and together with like-minded countries, within and beyond the region, including in Europe.  Officials from the four countries represented also shared concerns about a proposed security framework between the Solomon Islands and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and its serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The meeting was part of regular and extensive U.S. consultations with allies and partners on the Indo-Pacific and is part of the announced senior administration travel this week to Hawaii, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.   Updated at 1.47am BST    1.33am    Katharine Murphy had this story this morning: The Australian Christian Lobby is targeting moderate Liberals who crossed the floor to strengthen protections in Scott Morrison\u2019s religious discrimination package, distributing leaflets in their electorates showing a mocked-up image of MPs driving a wrecking ball into religious schools. Guardian Australia has seen new leaflets attacking Liberals Trent Zimmerman, who is in a fight to retain his seat of North Sydney; Dave Sharma, who is battling to hold the eastern suburbs seat of Wentworth; and Bridget Archer, who holds the most marginal Coalition seat in the country \u2013 Bass, in Tasmania. As well as the mocked-up image, the leaflets state the MPs \u201cvoted against protecting people of faith from discrimination\u201d when the package was before the parliament in February. It also says the MPs \u201cvoted to remove laws that protect the values of faith-based schools\u201d. You can read the full report here:    Updated at 1.35am BST    1.24am   'It is a scare campaign': David Littleproud on Coalition boats policy  David Littleproud was also on ABC radio RN Breakfast as part of his media rounds this morning, where he was pushed by Patricia Karvelas on various scare campaigns being run and became flustered enough as she pushed him on what the Coalition is saying about boats, to say this:  It is a scare campaign. Take away one element of the three elements of sovereign borders, which is the temporary protection visas, you open up the business model. That should scare every Australian.  PK: You want people to be scared? Littleproud:   You\u2019re opening up the borders again and you have people coming here illegally. It is not just about that, it is about the 1,300 souls that were lost. Any human being would be upset to think if you open up a business model again that would put ...   PK: Labor hasn\u2019t proposed opening up the business model. Littleproud:  They aren\u2019t going to support temporary protection visas. That is the challenge that we have.    Updated at 1.48am BST    1.06am   Barnaby Joyce says he plans to stay on as Nationals leader  Barnaby Joyce has said he intends on staying on as Nationals leader, even if the Coalition loses the election, the Northern Daily Leader has reported:  Deputy Prime Minister and Member for New England Barnaby Joyce has said he will stay on as Nationals leader regardless of the election result, so long as the party wants him to. Mr Joyce has held the Nationals leadership three times, and has no intention of letting it go again, even if that means fulfilling the role from shadow cabinet. \u201cDefinitely, absolutely, 100 per cent [I will be], this is incredibly important and I absolutely respect and thank the people of the New England for the great honour they give me in representing them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also the latitude of understanding in the office of deputy prime minister, that I have a duty to my nation that probably goes beyond the expectations of other people on the backbench.\u201d He did note, however, that being reinstated as party leader is not a guarantee. Mr Joyce said that was a matter for the party room and it would be wrong to speculate about what decisions may or may not be made depending on the outcome of May\u2019s election.  (Thank you to Gabby Chan for pointing me in that direction.)   Updated at 1.17am BST    1.01am    Looks like Anthony Albanese is gearing up for the debate tonight, given some of his answers there.      1.01am    That answer from Albanese continues:  We can end the climate wars in this country. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last 48 hours, frankly, is a thought bubble ... The problem for this government, and the reason why time\u2019s up for this government, they don\u2019t have a plan for the future.  They don\u2019t have a plan to deal with the economic transformation that will be driven by the shift that is happening in the global economy, to clean energy. That is something that is happening globally.  This government just have scare campaigns, they just have nonsense, making up figures, making things up, and they think that\u2019s enough to skate through without a plan for the future.    Updated at 1.16am BST    1.00am    Q: What chance would have Labor government have as hosting the Cop [climate change] conference, as you said you\u2019ll try to do, if you won\u2019t commit to this UN pledge?  Anthony Albanese:  I think we would have a very good chance of hosting a Cop conference. Our proposal by the way goes ... to Australia and the Pacific hosting a Cop conference.  I have had the honour of going to two conferences of the parties, the ones held in Montreal, where Kyoto came into effect, with number people ratifying the Kyoto protocol. I also attended the Cop in Nairobi.  And it isn\u2019t just a government to government engagement, although that of course is the main game. It\u2019s also one where business and civil society are participating in processes as well. So I think our plan, very conscientiously, as part of our announcement that we made back in December, of our climate plan, is about deeper engagement with the Pacific.  If you go to Kiribati, or Tuvalu, or any of those Pacific Island nations, what you will find, if you ask them what\u2019s their priority, they will talk about climate change.  So it is an opportunity for us together with the Pacific to embrace them. It\u2019s the sort of constructive relationship building that has been missing from this government.  I will make this point as well \u2013 that our climate policy is another example of the how ... We had more extensive negotiations and consultations with people from the business council of Australia, Australian industry group, National Farmers\u2019 Federation, the ACCI and the ACTU and unions, they all have been very supportive of our policy. That\u2019s what is important.   Updated at 1.13am BST    12.57am    Q: Why wouldn\u2019t an Albanese government sign the UN pledge to stop coal, why wouldn\u2019t you sign that pledge? Anthony Albanese:  Because coal is a part of our energy mix. Here in Australia, right now. Coal is a part of our energy mix here.      12.56am    Q: Back to the Solomons, you referred to Zed Seselja as a junior minister. Would an Albanese government elevate the significance of the Pacific portfolio? Would you be prepared to make a personal visit to the Solomons if elected? Anthony Albanese:  On the second, yes I would.  Q: On the first? Albanese:  We would have sent Penny Wong, quite frankly, and that would\u2019ve been more appropriate.  (That wasn\u2019t the question.)  Updated at 1.09am BST    12.55am    Q: Last week the high court said it was appropriate to fine the CFMEU maximum amount because lower amounts of fines weren\u2019t changing the industrial behaviour from that union. Can I put this question to you, rather than Mr Burke, just for a minute, what\u2019s your reaction to that ruling? Should we be worried about the CFMEU under a Labor government? Anthony Albanese gives the question to Tony Burke, saying \u201che\u2019s the spokesman\u201d. Burke:  We need to look at what courts had to say with respect to the ABCC. When the federal court said the ABCC was treating its job as a blood sport, then we\u2019ve got a regulator that\u2019s not doing its job.  We\u2019ve got a regulator set up to do a political job, we\u2019ve got a regulator that\u2019s told Senate estimates that if it sees a safety poster or a poster in a workplace that\u2019s raising money for flood relief, if it also carries a union logo, it\u2019s an offence.  They think those are the priorities. So we make no apology for saying a regulator that\u2019s ridiculously politicised, that\u2019s been criticised by the courts as behaving as though it\u2019s a blood sport, should not be a regulator. When you have a situation where there\u2019s aggression happening, where you have a situation where there\u2019s illegality happening, it should be the same rule across every workplace. The police should be called in \u2013 that\u2019s how you deal with illegal behaviour at every workplace.   Updated at 1.08am BST    12.53am   Anthony Albanese unleashes on government's aged care response  The Labor leader continues:  The title of the report is Neglect. In one word, and what we have is a neglect of a royal commission that has been titled Neglect. Neglect from ... this government.  We have made very clear what our plan is on aged care and quite frankly, when I sat in the budget lockup with Jim [Chalmers] and the team on the Tuesday night, because I did have a draft of the speech ready to go for Thursday, I was stunned when I asked, has anything at all happened on aged care?  And this is a government that has $70bn of additional spending with no offsets between MYEFO in December and then March budget. But they couldn\u2019t find a single dollar. Aged care workers are despairing.  This is tough work. It\u2019s physically demanding. They are faced with circumstances whereby they\u2019re in an aged care home and they have three buzzers going at once. Which person do they go and lift up? We have people living in their own soil, unable to be changed for days. We have 50% \u2013 the royal commission found this, this isn\u2019t Labor party versus Liberal Party \u2013 that over 50% of aged care residents were not getting the nutrition they need. They\u2019re literally starving. This is a crisis in this country.  This what is this election is about. This election is about whether we have a government that looks after people or whether we have Scott Morrison who goes missing, who goes missing unless there\u2019s a photo op, unless there\u2019s a campaign. I have no doubt they will deliver on that. He doesn\u2019t deliver on his key responsibility. He always blames someone else. A government member said to me, well, there aren\u2019t any votes in it, well I tell you what, this needs addressing.    Updated at 1.31am BST    12.51am    Q: Aged care workers in Queensland, WA and South Australia have voted in favour of industrial action. It\u2019s quite likely that strikes are going to take place in the next few weeks. Do you support these strikes, and if elected will you fully implement all recommendations of the royal commission and fund them? Tony Burke:  Well, I will deal with industrial, I will go back on the royal commission. What we\u2019re seeing is pressure having built up from people\u2019s wages having flatlined for 10 years. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. And to view this in an any other way misses the point what is happening in households. Every week as the pay comes through and the bills come through, it\u2019s becoming tighter and tighter and it\u2019s being going like that for a decade. What we\u2019re seeing happening at workplaces has been two things \u2013 unions did the right thing during the pandemic and held back on industrial action. It was incredibly responsible and it was done across the board. But secondly, what\u2019s happening now at a number of workplaces is that pressure that has been building for a decade, people are saying we need to get wages moving and Mr Morrison\u2019s response to that is to legislate a pay cut.  Anthony Albanese:  On the aged care issue, our five-point plan is directly arising from the aged care royal commission. That is a nurse in every nursing home, 24-7. That is [at least] 215 minutes of care [per day]. That is increased wages for people in the aged care sector. That is better food and nutrition. And we\u2019ve announced a specific plan with the Maggie Beer Foundation to deliver that. And the fifth and really important point \u2013 transparency and accountability. We want every dollar that goes into aged care to go into better care, and better food, and better outcomes for our older Australians.  And with regard to the recommendations of the royal commission, my observation is this: why does the government set up a royal commission and then ignore the central recommendations in it? People made these submissions about the crisis in aged care, and what they got from this government was contempt. Nothing to assist workers in the sector. You talk about the frustration that workers are feeling workers are leaving the sector.  Think about this. All of you here today, and the workers here today, will have parents, will have uncles and aunties ... if they\u2019re really young, they may have grandparents, it may be us one day. And there won\u2019t be an aged care sector to look after them unless we do something about this and unless we do something about it now.   Updated at 1.04am BST    12.50am    Q: On the issue of both turn backs, you have made the point you now support turning back the boats. How would you implement turning back the boats, and how many did you turn back last time you were in government? Anthony Albanese:  Yesterday I got a misleading question from you, with respect, Jono, what you did was two separate questions and you conflated an answer.  Q: Back on your statement ... Albanese:  They were two separate questions you put to me. I gave one answer but it was two answers to two questions and I was perfectly accurate yesterday. Labor supports turning back boats. Where it\u2019s safe to do so. The same policy, exactly the same policy as the government.   Updated at 1.00am BST    12.49am    Q: You said that Australia is in the naughty corner when it comes to climate change on the international stage. A key reason for that, the fact the government wouldn\u2019t sign the UN pledge to end coal use. Would you sign that pledge? If not, why not? Anthony Albanese:  No.  Q: Why not? He moves on to the next question.  Updated at 12.59am BST    12.48am    Q: Mr Albanese, can I please ask you, what is your view on transgender participation in women\u2019s sport? Anthony Albanese:  That\u2019s covered by the Sex Discrimination Act.  Q: But what\u2019s your personal view? Albanese:  That girls should be able to play sport against girls and boys should be able to play sport against boys.  It\u2019s covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. And that sports currently are in control of this issue.  So, let me tell you what this issue is really about \u2013 this is an issue about the chaos within the NSW branch of the Liberal party. And I note that once again we see a leaked text message that is supposed to be a private text message from the NSW premier to the prime minister. Once again, this prime minister, the premier says that he didn\u2019t leak the text message. I don\u2019t know the source of that.   Q: Can I also get Tony Burke and Jim Chalmers to respond to my question. Albanese:  They have the same position.  Q: Can they say that? Albanese:  That\u2019s why I\u2019m the leader.   Updated at 12.58am BST    12.45am    Q: Fines for thuggish unions and officials. What is your position on that? Do you think it\u2019s a good idea, would you support it? Tony Burke:  It\u2019s no surprise, first of all, what has been announced by the government today is not our policy. So just to give you that cleanly.  But secondly, it is no surprise that the government has decided the biggest issue they want to deal with is to be able to have an attack on unions, and still to this day they have not legislated to deal with wage theft. So, if an employer is stealing from their workers, Mr Morrison doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a concern.  And we saw some extraordinary cases, over the time that Mr Morrison has been prime minister, it\u2019s not just that they ... couldn\u2019t get around to it. They had wage theft legislation in the parliament in front of them, written by themselves, and they, together with One Nation, voted it down.  So the priorities of the government here are just completely wrong. And if they were serious about wanting to make sure we had law abiding at the workplace, the first thing to do is to make sure that people are paid properly.    Updated at 1.52am BST    12.44am    Q: If I can ask you on a draft for teachers, a guidelines for teachers in the Northern Territory, it shows teachers being urged to organise non-gendered sports teams. Do you think this is a positive thing, or do you think it raises some concerns? Anthony Albanese:  I note it\u2019s been dismissed already by the NT government. It\u2019s not appropriate.  (Non-gendered sport has been played in co-ed schools for years).  Updated at 12.54am BST    12.43am   Albanese says Australia needs to 'rebuild' relationship with Pacific  Q: Is there anything your government could do if you were elected in four weeks\u2019 time to reverse what Penny Wong has described as the worst foreign policy failure since in the end of the second world war? Anthony Albanese:  This is a massive foreign policy failure on the prime minister\u2019s watch. One which they were warned about, even in the weeks leading up to the government finally sending Zed Seselja, a junior person, to the Solomons. We were saying, what you are doing to engage here?  This isn\u2019t something that has just arisen. This is something that has been in the planning for a period of time. And quite clearly I think relationships have broken down. And the United States ... historically has relied upon Australia to be a key player in the Pacific as well. Australia has been the security partner of choice for the Pacific for a long period of time, for the entire post-world war two period. That\u2019s broken down. We need to rebuild it.   Updated at 12.53am BST    12.42am    Q: Mr Albanese, if you are prime minister, what would you do in the Solomons? Would you be seeking to unravel this agreement, go to Beijing and meet with the leadership there, what would your approach be? Anthony Albanese:  I would be engaging with the leadership of the Solomons. And I would have done it over a period of time. The problem is those relationships aren\u2019t ones that can be done just during when there\u2019s a crisis. When Richard Marles was our person in the Pacific, he had deep engagement, indeed, won a civil honour in the Solomons.  What is clear is we\u2019ve dropped the ball here. What is clear is when the warning was given in August, the government didn\u2019t act soon enough. August is now more than six months ago, eight months ago \u2013 the government was warned about this.   Updated at 12.52am BST    12.41am    Tony Burke is also at this press conference:  The announcement by the government to bring back the omnibus bill is extraordinary. We have a situation where everything has been going up, except for wages, and the government now says they want to bring back legislation which had wage cuts written all over it \u2013 111 pages that bill was, and it had wage cuts in black and white.  This is legislation that says your ordinary hourly rate, that can stay the same, but every penalty rate, every shift allowance, every loading, overtime rate, up for grabs. What does it mean in the real world? It means if you\u2019re someone working in retail as a night manager, $10,000 a year can be up for grabs as a pay cut.  If you\u2019re a butcher working on a Thursday to Sunday shift, $7,000 a year. If you\u2019re a part-time disability care worker, $14,000 a year.  Now, you only say we\u2019re going to suspend the better off overall test if you want to allow a situation for people to be worse off.  Low wages haven\u2019t been an accident. The government made clear low wages are a deliberate design feature of their management of the economy. At a time when Australians are desperately wanting to see wages get moving again, the prime minister has made clear legislation that is about cutting wages is on the way back, if Mr Morrison is returned.   Updated at 12.50am BST    12.38am   Anthony Albanese holds press conference  The Labor campaign is in the south-east Queensland seat of Forde. Anthony Albanese and Labor are talking industrial relations, warning the Morrison government wants to take away the better-off-overall test. Albanese is also talking about the security pact between Solomon Islands and China.  Can I make some comments about one of the greatest policy failures that we\u2019ve seen from this government \u2013 this deal between China and the Solomons was foreshadowed, foreshadowed last August, the government was warned.  Yet only in recent days did the government bother to send a junior person across to the Solomons. No visit from the foreign minister, no visit from the defence minister, no engagement in a serious way with prime minister Sogavare.  What we see is a foreign policy failure on our doorstep. The Solomon Islands is less than 2,000km from Cairns and Townsville. The distance between here and Perth is more than that. So what we see is a massive policy failure because once again the character of this government is on show. A prime minister who goes missing on the big questions.  A prime minister who is always too little, too late. Whether it\u2019s the bushfires, whether it\u2019s ordering enough vaccines, whether it\u2019s ordering rapid antigen tests, whether it\u2019s responding to the floods, this prime minister is complacent. He\u2019s always there for the photo op, never there for the follow up, never does the right planning to get ahead of issues.   Updated at 12.46am BST    12.30am    Penny Wong was also asked about the election campaign this morning. She had this to say:  What I\u2019d say to every voter including new voters, and I had the opportunity to chat to a couple of young women in Adelaide yesterday who were going to vote for the first time and they were excited about it and they were informing themselves, I say have a look at what the policies are. Have a look at where this country is and have a think about whether we can do better.  Can we do better on climate change? Of course we can. And that\u2019s what Labor is offering. Can we do better on childcare? Of course we can. That\u2019s what Labor is offering. Can we do better on strengthening Medicare? Of course we can. And that\u2019s what Labor is offering. So there are a lot of issues that are important for the future of the country. Of course, there\u2019s always the media focus on the game, but beneath that, underneath that is actually something profoundly important, which is: what sort of country are we?    Updated at 12.35am BST    12.15am   Melbourne to host Brazil-Argentina clash in World Cup warm-up  Melbourne will again host one of the biggest rivalries in world sport this winter when Brazil take on Argentina in front of a potential 100,000-strong crowd at the MCG.  The fierce football rivals will meet in the latest edition of the Supercl\u00e0sico on Saturday 11 June, which will serve as a World Cup warm-up before the tournament in Qatar at the end of the year. It is not the first time the two powerhouse nations have met in Melbourne; the last time they clashed at the MCG was in 2017, when more than 95,000 watched an underwhelming 1-0 victory for Argentina.  Then, after a much hyped build-up amid the prospect of a mouthwatering Lionel Messi-Neymar clash, many big name Brazilian players, including Neymar himself, did not make the trip. Still, given the reputations of the two sides, the Victorian government says it expects thousands of interstate and international visitors to Melbourne for the upcoming match.  The minister for tourism, sport and major events, Martin Pakula, said:  To have two of the most successful football teams in the world return to the MCG to continue their longstanding rivalry reinforces our position as one of the world\u2019s great sporting cities and Australia\u2019s event capital. Football is known as the world game and a match of this calibre will put millions of eyes on Melbourne and attract thousands of visitors to Victoria.    Updated at 12.28am BST    12.14am   NSW records 15 new Covid deaths and Victoria records 14  New South Wales and Victoria have reported their Covid figures for the past 24 hours. NSW has recorded 15,414 new Covid cases and 15 deaths, with 1,639 people with the virus in hospital.  Victoria reported 10,628 new cases and 14 deaths, with 437 hospitalisations. Seeing these numbers will never be easy.     Updated at 12.22am BST    12.01am   'The worst Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific since world war two': Wong on Solomon Islands  Penny Wong is doing the media rounds today, branding the newly-signed security agreement between China and Solomon Islands as \u201cthe worst Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific\u201d in decades. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson was scathing on Wednesday morning. She accused the Coalition of mishandling the situation, raising concerns of a potential Chinese military presence 1,600km from Australia in Solomon Islands. \u201cOn Scott Morrison\u2019s watch, our region has become less secure, and the risks Australia faces have become much greater,\u201d she told the ABC. The Pacific minister Zed Seselja flew to Honiara last week to ask Solomon Islands prime minister Manasseh Sogavare to consider not signing the security pact with China. Wong said the government should have done more, describing the deployment of Seselja as \u201ca junior woodchuck at the last minute\u201d. \u201cYet again Mr Morrison has gone missing and might talk a tough game, but what we are seeing on his watch is the worst Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific since the end of world war two,\u201d Wong said. In a separate press conference, she said more should have been done. \u201cSomeone in government needed to take responsibility,\u201d Wong claimed. \u201cWe always support ministers going overseas to work for Australia\u2019s interest s... but do I think it was too little too late? Clearly it was.\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow industrial relations minister, Tony Burke, claimed on ABC News the Coalition hadn\u2019t made more serious diplomatic moves \u201cbecause everybody more senior was too busy with an election campaign\u201d. In her own interview with ABC\u2019s AM, Marise Payne said the government was disappointed at the agreement but respected the sovereignty of Solomon Islands. She denied the Coalition had dropped the ball, saying she and Morrison had engaged directly with the Solomon Islands government by phone on the issue, and called Labor\u2019s criticisms \u201cunfair\u201d. \u201cWe firmly believe the Pacific family is best placed to meet the security needs of our region,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are looking at very serious geostrategic challenges in our region.\u201d  Updated at 12.12am BST    12.00am    Meanwhile, the Australian newspaper has an exclusive story that NSW premier Dom Perrottet sent Scott Morrison a text message saying he agreed with him over his comments on women\u2019s sport.  That\u2019s all over the Katherine Deves candidacy for Warringah. Her inflammatory and transphobic past comments on LGBTIQ issues have become a campaign flashpoint, with Morrison declaring she had his support and he would not allow her to be \u201csilenced\u201d. Two people were involved in that text message exchange.  And now:   Updated at 12.07am BST    11.49pm    For followers of South Australian politics, the good burghers of Bragg in Adelaide\u2019s east are headed back to the polls, with Vickie Chapman announcing she will quit politics at the end of the month, triggering a by-election. Chapman is a moderate Liberal and the new SA Liberal leader, David Speirs is ... not in the same faction.   Updated at 11.55pm BST    11.39pm    Katharine Murphy has the latest Guardian Essential poll:  Labor appears to have lost ground in the opening week of the federal election campaign according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, but a majority of respondents still think Anthony Albanese will be Australia\u2019s next prime minister. The latest survey of 1,020 respondents shows Labor\u2019s standing in the two-party preferred \u201cplus\u201d measure is down three points in a fortnight, and there has been a two point increase in the number of undecided voters. But 55% of respondents believe Labor will win on 21 May. Voting intention figures, calculated by Guardian Essential, now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred \u201cplus\u201d, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction.    Updated at 11.44pm BST    11.38pm    Q: Should the government have sent Scott Morrison or Marise Payne instead of a junior minister? David Littleproud tells the ABC:  Well, let me make this clear \u2013 the prime minister has been in constant contact not only with the prime minister of the Solomon Islands, but other Pacific nations have also been in diplomatic discussions with the Solomon Islands. But we\u2019re in caretaker mode and when you\u2019re in caretaker mode there is an agreement between the government and the opposition about a joint approach to this.  And the opposition, the Labor party, agreed* that the best form of attack that we put forward was that Zed Seselja should go there as the Pacific minister, as one who ... has been on the ground on the Solomon Islands and with our other Pacific nations in dealing with this matter, would have better cut-through. And they actually agreed to that.  So now that [they] want to politicise this, just disappointing. And I think it\u2019s just important now that we all take a deep breathe, we show some calm and restraint and ... work collaboratively with our Pacific family about how we can work with the Solomon Islands. We don\u2019t want to isolate them and by inflaming language for political points at the moment could inflame the situation.  * Under caretaker mode, Labor did have to agree to send Seselja, but it\u2019s not usually something that turns into a negotiation over policy.   Updated at 11.52pm BST    11.28pm    David Littleproud is up next, and as you would expect, he defends the government over the Solomon Islands-China security:  I just think we need some maturity and calm. What we have seen so far is some statements by the Solomon Islands prime minister to say that there will be no military bases.  We haven\u2019t seen the detail of this pact and before we start making commentary and gratuitous commentary from the sidelines we should get the details. When you\u2019re dealing with diplomatic matters, particularly with many of our Pacific family who have been part of this conversation with us, with the Solomon Islands, that it is important before you start condemning the actions of not only Australia but our other Pacific partners in this \u2013 you put at risk of inflaming the situation.  So if you want to be the foreign minister, it\u2019s important you act with restraint and calm and make sure that you understand all the details before you start making a politicised point.  It\u2019s important, obviously, we\u2019re disappointed, but we\u2019re working through this calmly, not only with the Solomon Islands but our Pacific family ... in trying to get an understanding and appreciation of how far this goes.  The prime minister, as I said, has made it clear ... clear enunciation from the Solomon Islands that there will be no military base there. We take solace in that but we need to work through this pact before we start trying to politicise and I think that\u2019s the maturity that Australians would expect, particularly when you\u2019re talking about our national security and the threats that may come from it.   Updated at 11.43pm BST    11.21pm    How would a Labor government handle Australia\u2019s relationship with China? Penny Wong:  I think it\u2019s really critical we deal with the increasingly assertive and aggressive China, first, by ensuring we secure our region. So we understand that our interests on a range of issues are very different, and Labor will never take a backward step when it comes to standing up for Australia\u2019s interests. But our first priority must be to secure our region and that is why this failure of Mr Morrison is so great because it goes directly to his failure to secure our region when we needed him. When Australia needed him, he went missing yet again.   Updated at 11.35pm BST    11.20pm    Wong is asked whether Labor is suggesting Morrison should have gone to Solomon Islands himself, and says:  Well, he\u2019s the leader offer of the country. This is our region. It goes directly to Australia\u2019s national security and he should have taken responsibility. The United States is sending, you know, their top Indo-Pacific national security advisor, Kurt Campbell. We send the junior minister in the last minute in a region which is critical to our security.  Yet again Mr Morrison has gone missing, and might talk a tough game, but what we are seeing on his watch is the worst Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific since the end of world war two.  Could a Labor government unpick it?  Well, look, I can tell you what we will do is put more resources and more energy into ensuring that the Pacific family, which Mr Morrison and Marise Payne like to talk about, but that the Pacific family is secure.  And what we won\u2019t do is do things like mismanage the Pacific labour scheme, cut development assistance by $12bn since they came to government and we won\u2019t make jokes about water lapping at the door at Pacific Island leaders meetings like we saw Mr Morrison and Mr Dutton doing.  We would be serious on climate and remember \u2013 climate change has been identified by Pacific leaders as their number one economic and national security priority.    Updated at 11.33pm BST    11.17pm   Penny Wong lashes Morrison government over handling of Solomon Islands  As Daniel Hurst reported last night, Australia is reeling from the signing of the security pact between Solomon Islands and China. You may remember the minister for the Pacific Zed Seselja was sent to Solomon Islands to try to discourage the pact. Labor is pointing the finger at the Morrison government.  Penny Wong told the ABC this morning:  This is the worst foreign policy blunder in the Pacific that Australia has seen since the end of world war two ... It is going to make our region less secure and this is all happened on Scott Morrison\u2019s watch.  He was warned ... back in August, we were told by the opposition leader in the Solomon Islands, the prime minister, that the Australian government was warned that this was in the offing. But what has happened, well, we have seen it\u2019s come to fruition and as a consequence of Mr Morrison going missing, just like he did on bushfires, on vaccines and on rapid antigen tests ... our region is less secure and the risks Australia faces have got greater.    Updated at 11.39pm BST    11.10pm    Well, yesterday NSW and Victorian business groups called for a change to close contact covid rules \u2013 and today, it looks like they\u2019ll be getting what they wanted.      11.01pm    Bob Katter has called for the age pension to be increased by $100 a week to help older Australians cope with the rising cost of living. To pay for the $14bn a year policy, Katter says the federal governmentshould place a 5% surcharge on all imports into the country, which \u201cwould generate $20n a year and give Australian industry and workers a competitive advantage\u201d. \u201cIf you want to buy something from China instead of Australia, then you should pay 10 percent more for it,\u201d the independent Queensland MP said. \u201cIt might teach people to buy Australian made and not from overseas. \u201cPeople who have worked their whole lives for our nation can\u2019t afford to live on the age pension payment they are getting now. Some people on the pension did not have superannuation for most of their working life. \u201cSingle pensioners can currently earn $180 a fortnight before their pension is reduced. I think that figure should be increased so that pensioners can work if they want to, without being penalised.\u201d   Updated at 2.00am BST    10.42pm   Good morning  Good morning and welcome to debate day! (The exclamation mark is sarcastic, I promise.)  Scott Morrison and the Liberal campaign touched down in South Australia last night. Anthony Albanese and Labor are still in Queensland. Morrison will head to Brisbane later today ahead of the first debate between the two leaders.  The Sky News/Courier Mail People\u2019s Forum gets undecided voters to ask the questions. It\u2019ll be the first time the pair face off against each other without anyone being able to ask for the member to no longer be heard.  So expect some early campaigning today before both camps go dark to prepare the leaders.  Barnaby Joyce is also in Queensland \u2013 he\u2019s in Mackay making more spending commitments, this time on roads.  We\u2019ll cover it all off as the day unfolds. You have Amy Remeikis on the blog as usual, with Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Daniel Hurst and Josh Butler keeping a sharp eye on what\u2019s happening on the campaign \u2013 and what\u2019s really behind the promises and policy.  Ready? I\u2019m not. But still \u2013 let\u2019s get into it.   Updated at 10.44pm BST "

For my sins, I will be back with you tomorrow morning with all the latest news. Here\u2019s what made the news today:  The Nadesalingam family have had an emotional reunion with the Queensland regional town of Biloela, after years in immigration detention and legal uncertainty. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, held meetings for what Ardern said was a reset of the relationship as a result of the election of the new Labor government. Ardern reiterated NZ\u2019s longstanding opposition to deporting New Zealand citizens on character grounds when they have lived most of their lives in Australia, but Albanese would not say whether there would be a change in policy. There were chaotic scenes at Sydney and Melbourne airports on Friday as Australians embarked on Queen\u2019s birthday long weekend holidays, with airports unable to cope due to ongoing staffing issues. Victoria announced a new $500m women and children\u2019s hospital in Geelong. Senator Mehreen Faruqi  was appointed deputy leader of the Australian Greens, replacing Senator Nick McKim and Senator Larissa Waters.  The NSW government committed almost $570m to upgrade the state\u2019s Opal transport system and launched a trial of a new all-in-one transport app. There were 40 reported Covid-19 deaths.  Until tomorrow, stay warm.

Updated at 9.12am BST    9.02am    Warning issued over pink ecstasy tablets containing double the average dose NSW Health is warning that ecstasy tablets circulating in the community which are pink in colour and marked with an Audi logo are two times the average dose of MDMA per tablet.  Medical director of the NSW Poisons Information Centre, Dr Darren Roberts, said:   It can cause severe agitation and paranoia, raised body temperature, seizures or fits, irregular heart rhythm and death. While one MDMA tablet alone can cause life-threatening toxicity, the risk is greatly increased if high doses or multiple MDMA tablets are consumed over a short period, or if MDMA is consumed in combination with other stimulants, such as cocaine.   Updated at 9.11am BST    8.30am   Australian government rejects Myanmar court's Sean Turnell ruling  The foreign minister, Penny Wong, says the Australian government rejects the court ruling in Myanmar this week against Australian professor Sean Turnell, to continue their violating official secrets law trial. Wong:  It is more than 16 months since Professor Turnell was detained by the Myanmar military. He remains imprisoned in Myanmar, and we continue to call for his immediate release. Professor Turnell has worked for Myanmar\u2019s economic development for many years and is internationally respected for this record. We will continue to advocate for Professor Turnell\u2019s interests and well-being and will not stop until he is safely back with his family.

It comes after the minister for Aboriginal affairs, Gabrielle Williams, introduced the treaty authority bill to parliament earlier this week.  If passed, it will allow for an independent authority to be established with the legal powers necessary to facilitate treaty negotiations between the government and traditional owners, and resolve any disputes between parties.  It will have a funding stream detached from the standard political cycles. Authority members \u2013 all of which will be First Peoples \u2013 will be appointed by a panel independent of government.  Assembly co-chair and Bangerang and Wiradjuri Elder, Aunty Geraldine Atkinson, said the hard work of the last two years was starting to deliver tangible progress on the journey to treaty.  \u201cOurs is the oldest living culture on the planet. It\u2019s clear that our lore and law has stood the test of time and I\u2019m overjoyed and very proud to see it being embedded into the very core of the new institutions we\u2019re creating to get treaty done,\u201d she said.Assembly member Aunty Charmaine Clarke presented Andrews with a message stick, giving him permission to address the assembly.  The premier, Daniel Andrews, spoke of how treaty will change the shape of the state\u2019s cultural landscape, and how Victorians view and understand their identity, history, and future.

The state recorded 2,342 new cases. There are 235 people in hospital, with five in intensive care.

Police and paramedics were called to the surf park at Tullamarine at 11.30am. The surfer, a man believed to be in his 40s, was treated for a medical condition at the park and is now at the Royal Melbourne hospital in a critical condition. URBNSURF, which opened in 2020, uses technology to create waves for surfers at every level. The park released a statement saying the it had been immediately closed after the incident. \u201cThere has been a serious incident at URBNSURF Melbourne, our team has provided support and care for the friends on site,\u201d a statement from URBNSURF read. \u201cOur first priority is the health and safety of our customers. \u201cAs soon as the incident occurred, we immediately closed the park and are continuing to provide our full cooperation to the first responders and police. \u201cThe facility will remain closed until further notice. As a police investigation is under way, we are unable to provide any further comment.\u201d  Updated at 7.31am BST    7.13am    Tim Watts says 250 passport processing staff to be added over six weeks to address backlog Watts says the backlog of passport applications is a \u201cbig failure\u201d of the former Coalition government, that should have been foreseen given borders opening up after two years. He says people need to factor in at least six weeks for passport applications. Thirty-five additional staff were put on this week, and 35 will be put on next week. He says 250 passport processing staff will be put on in the next six weeks to deal with the backlog, but says \u201cit\u2019s not going to be a quick fix but will take some time to work through, so we ask Australians to please plan ahead and get your passport applications in as soon as possible\u201d.  Updated at 7.17am BST    7.09am   Peter Dutton 'desperate' to distract from defence failures, says Labor's Tim Watts  Assistant foreign affairs minister, Tim Watts, says on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing that the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has shown he \u201cnever got off the training wheels\u201d during the time he was defence minister, following his recent comments about the plans for a stopgap submarine purchase prior to the election. He said:  The only operation of these six unsuccessful defence ministers of the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison government is announcing things, desperate to ensure no-one looks at the record of failure on delivery, a record of decades of delays, billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars of cost blowouts and little delivered for the Australian taxpayer.  And today in the newspapers we see that Peter Dutton is continuing to deliver announcements as a political tactic from opposition. It\u2019s fair to say that Peter Dutton would be close to the last person you\u2019d listen to on advice on defence procurement acquisitions, but he has a bit of company on that list with the five other failed defence ministers ...   Updated at 8.42am BST    7.03am    \u2018We can come together as one\u2019: friends of Nadesalingam family vow to keep fighting for permanent protection As Priya Nadesalingam touched down in Biloela for the first time in four years she bent down and kissed the ground.  Supporters and friends of the Nadesalingam family welcomed the family home with hugs, rainbow streamers and signs embellished with cockatoos. The humble Thangool airport in Central Queensland was overwhelmed this morning, as media and supporters swarmed the airport, awaiting the family\u2019s arrival. The excitement was such that an airport worker had to ask the crowd to stay to one side so that when the family touched down they would able to get out smoothly. As Priya, Nades and their children, Kopika and Tharnicaa, exited the plane, the family received a celebrity welcome and applause from the crowd - one of the girls even blew supporters a kiss. Teary, Priya said she was \u201cvery happy\u201d that she was able to return to Biloela. She said she hoped the government would grant her family with permanent protection and provide other refugees with certainty. She said the family had been treated \u201cinhumanely\u201d in detention.  In May, interim home affairs minister, Jim Chalmers, granted the family bridging visas, allowing them to leave community detention in Perth and return to their home in Biloela. But they are still fighting for permanent protection \u2013 something the government could grant them with the stroke of a pen using the \u201cgodlike\u201d powers of ministerial discretion.  Angelica Fredricks, a friend of the family, said the Home to Bilo campaign is going \u201cto keep fighting until this family has permanency\u201d. \u201cAustralians have shown that we can unite.. we can come together as one,\u201d she said. With the family attending the Flourish festival on Saturday and Tharnicaa\u2019s fifth birthday party on Sunday, it\u2019s looking to be a hectic welcome home for the Tamil refugee family. Myself and photographer Mike Bowers have flown up to Biloela and will be speaking with the family, locals and their friends over the next few days \u2013 so keep an eye out.   Updated at 8.07am BST    6.57am   Mehreen Faruqi appointed deputy leader of the Greens  Senator Mehreen Faruqi has been appointed deputy leader of the Australian Greens, replacing Senator Nick McKim and Senator Larissa Waters. The party voted on leadership positions at a party room meeting in Melbourne today.  Adam Bandt was reappointed as leader, Faruqi is in the deputy position. Waters was appointed leader in the Senate, Lidia Thorpe is deputy Senate leader, and Sarah Hanson-Young is manager of Senate business. McKim, whose office issued the statement announcing the leadership change, was appointed senate whip. Senator Janet Rice is the party room chair. They have also established a new position: house whip, a position they have not needed previously, with Bandt in the lower house on his lonesome. That position will be voted on at a later date. The statement said all appointments were \u201csupported unanimously and decided by consensus\u201d.    Updated at 7.05am BST    6.45am    A happy day in Biloela \u2013 a rare outcome in Australia\u2019s immigration system The press conference has wrapped up. That was wonderful to see the Nadesalingam family back in Biloela. I\u2019d covered their court battle \u2013 almost every hearing from the day an emergency injunction was issued preventing their removal from Australia, while they were mid-flight being removed from Australia.  Australia\u2019s immigration law is harsh, and almost all of the thousands and thousands cases do not get the attention that this family\u2019s had. Sitting in court watching each small progression, and incremental victory, it always seemed like an impossible hill for them to climb \u2013 even though the immigration minister always had the power to fix it at any time.  So today is a happy day. It\u2019s not over for them yet. They still don\u2019t yet have permanent residency, but the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, said this week he is being \u201cbriefed on options\u201d and will make a decision as soon as possible. There are many, many others who won\u2019t get a happy resolution in Australia\u2019s immigration system who should, but that shouldn\u2019t detract people from feeling happy today for this family for finally getting back home to Biloela.   Updated at 6.56am BST    6.28am   'We were treated very badly': Priya Nadesalingam  Priya Nadesalingam says (through a translator) that the family\u2019s treatment in the detention was inhumane:  We were treated very badly and my children [were] affected mentally and physically and even my youngest one lost teeth. We had a really hard life and I hope that nobody goes through that.   She says she is very thankful the change of government has allowed her to return home to Biloela today. She says she is hoping the government comes through with permanent residency for the family soon (they are currently on bridging visas).  Updated at 6.33am BST    6.22am    There is a Facebook live stream of the Nadesalingam family press conference if you want to continue watching it. The sound isn\u2019t great, but we will have a more full report soon.  Updated at 6.23am BST    6.17am   Nadesalingam family speaks in Biloela  The press conference at Biloela with the Nadesalingam family has started.  Priya says she is very happy to be there.  One of the supporters from the Tamil Refugee Council has noted that although Priya and Nades were treated with \u201cunimaginable cruelty\u201d by the former Coalition government, they were first put into detention by the former Labor government. He says that it is still not safe for Tamil people to live in Sri Lanka, and calls for the new Labor government to review the policy that Tamil people can return to Sri Lanka. My colleague Eden Gillespie will have a full report from the press conference soon.   Updated at 6.20am BST    6.02am    Arden\u2019s statement on \u2018successful\u2019 meeting with Albanese And now the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has issued her own statement about the \u201cfirst successful bilateral meeting\u201d with Anthony Albanese in Sydney today. Ardern said she was delighted to congratulate the Australian prime minister in person on his election win. She also confirmed that they would meet again in July.  Our time together today cements an already very close relationship between our two nations. To meet so quickly after the Australian election is indicative of the close relationship of our two countries. I look forward to continue working together, and hosting the Prime Minister in New Zealand in the future.Through our single economic market, our people-to-people ties and our shared interests in our region and the world, wherever New Zealand and Australia face challenges and change, we both gain more by facing them together.    Ardern\u2019s statement said the pair had \u201cdiscussed cooperation and engagement in the Pacific region, in particular the importance of working together to support Pacific partners facing a complex and growing array of challenges, including climate change and an increasingly contested strategic environment\u201d. The talks also covered Australia and New Zealand\u2019s \u201ccommon goals on the international stage\u201d, the statement said. Ardern welcomed the new Australian government\u2019s emphasis on First Nations voices and Albanese\u2019s commitment to implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The statement said both prime ministers agreed to continue to ensure Indigenous perspectives were at the centre of policy making. Here is what Ardern\u2019s statement said about Australia\u2019s section 501 visa cancellation policy:  I\u2019ve asked Prime Minister Albanese to see what changes might be possible, in particular to take greater account of potential deportees\u2019 links to New Zealand. In New Zealand for instance, we do not deport individuals who have lived here for 10 years or more.   Updated at 6.16am BST    5.55am   Victorian vegetable farm fined $60,000 for hiring illegal workers  Australia\u2019s largest grower of broccolini and asparagus has been fined $60,000 for employing illegal workers to pick vegetables.  Workers for M&amp;G Vizzarri Pty Ltd, which is headed by Giuseppe Vizzarri, were paid under the award rate \u2013 female employees were paid $14 an hour, while men were given $15 an hour \u2013 when they worked at its Gippsland farm in 2016. Vizzarri pleaded guilty to eight charges of allowing an unlawful non-citizen to work and one charge of allowing a lawful non-citizen to work in breach of their visa requirements.  In the county court this morning, judge Trevor Wraight said no one at M&amp;G Vizzarri ever checked if the workers had visas, even though the company was aware of an online government site that helps businesses check.  Wraight said if the business had not pleaded guilty he would have fined it $100,000, close to the maximum penalty of $108,000.  \u201cIt was not an early plea, but still has significant utilitarian value,\u201d Wraight said.  Updated at 6.01am BST    5.47am    Eden Gillespie is on the ground in Biloela and has footage of the Nadesalingam family\u2019s arrival.   Updated at 5.51am BST    5.43am    Barnaby Joyce welcomes Nadesalingam family\u2019s return to Biloela  The shadow veterans affairs minister, Barnaby Joyce, has welcomed the fact the Nadesalingam family has been allowed to return to Biloela. Joyce first called for this while a backbencher, before returning as Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, but it has taken a Labor government to release them from detention. Joyce told Sky News:  Should\u2019ve happened, job\u2019s done, tick. Those young girls were born in Australia. Send them back to Sri Lanka? Why not send them back to Rwanda? That\u2019s another country they weren\u2019t born in. Or Finland. Or Mozambique. They were born in Australia \u2013 they are Australians. Why do I get so worked up about this? Because I was kicked out of the parliament because apparently someone thought I was a New Zealander. That was a small slight. Imagine if I was kicked out of the country.  A shaky understanding of citizenship aside, there\u2019s no denying his passion on the issue.  Updated at 5.48am BST    5.39am    Nadesalingam family finally home after four years It\u2019s an emotional time for the family as they leave the plane and arrive back in Biloela for the first time in four years, after they were removed by Border Force and put into immigration detention.   Updated at 5.55am BST    5.35am   Touch down in Biloela  The Nadesalingam family have touched down in Biloela, so we are expecting a press conference with the family and supporters shortly.    Updated at 5.59am BST    5.30am   Media and supporters gather at airport for Nadesalingam family  Mike Bowers and I have arrived in Biloela where the Nadesalingam family will be landing today at Thangool airport. \u201cAirport\u201d is a generous term \u2013 there is one runway, a toilet and a small waiting area, with the aerodrome surrounded by farmland. We\u2019ve arrived over an hour early and there is already one supporter of the family waiting for them to arrive in the car park, with red and yellow flowers secured under the window shield of her car and rainbow paper mache tucked under her mirror. The media pack is also here early, staking out a spot to welcome the family. Things are pretty quiet for now but stay tuned \u2013 it looks like it\u2019ll get crowded soon.  I\u2019ve just spoken with friends of the family, Lorraine and Margot, who have been waiting for hours for the family to touch down in Thangool airport. Both women have been fighting for the family to return home to Biloela. Margot drove three hours from Bundaberg to be here. She calls herself the girl\u2019s grandma and has known the family for years.  \u201cI\u2019ve known Kopi since she was four years old and Tharnicaa since she was four days old. They\u2019re my little granddaughters,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been crying to myself, I\u2019ve been laughing to myself. I can\u2019t wait to give them a hug.\u201d  Lorraine has picked flowers for the family from her garden and brought streamers and signs to welcome the family home. Margot says she is happy the family has been granted bridging visas but hopes the family will be granted permanent protection. \u201cThese are our people here \u2026 the people here embrace them. I would like to see them get the family out of this town now. They\u2019ll have a fight.\u201d  Updated at 5.49am BST    5.21am    Albanese says Australia and New Zealand share a \u2018uniquely close relationship\u2019  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has issued a statement about his talks earlier today with New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern. Albanese said the two countries shared \u201ca uniquely close relationship\u201d:  It is a relationship of whanau\u2014of family. That\u2019s why it\u2019s fitting that Prime Minister Ardern is the first foreign leader I\u2019ve met with as Prime Minister on Australian soil. We are countries with common culture and values, shared interests and outlooks. The Prime Minister and I both know that trade and integration mean jobs, growth and opportunities. We are determined to work together to take the trans-Tasman economic relationship to new heights. Next year, we will celebrate 80 years of diplomatic relations, and 40 years of our ground-breaking Closer Economic Relations trade agreement\u2014one the most comprehensive trade agreements in the world.  The statement also addresses the increasing contest for influence in the Pacific:  Australia and New Zealand are proud Pacific nations and we value our relationships with our Pacific partners very deeply. We will work side-by-side with our Pacific brothers and sisters. We are committed to deepening our partnerships in support of a stable and prosperous region.   There is also a big emphasis on climate in Albanese\u2019s statement:  Together, Australia and New Zealand face the global challenges of a changing climate, economic uncertainty and shifting dynamics in global security. And together, we can work towards solutions to these challenges, including realising a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Ardern and I discussed climate change and the ambitious action my Government will take. We will reduce Australia\u2019s emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 and ensure we are firmly on track for Net Zero by 2050. Like New Zealand, we intend to legislate our Net Zero target. We will also submit an updated new Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) soon. I look forward to working closely with Prime Minister Ardern to ensure the continued success of our Trans-Tasman relationship.   Updated at 5.26am BST    5.07am    TWU calls for overhaul of airline industry standards amid airport chaos The Transport Workers\u2019 Union has called on the federal government to lift standards in the airline industry to bring workers back to the sector and fix the issues causing the long lines seen at airports today.  The union has called for a \u201cSafe and Secure Skies\u201d commission.  Michael Kaine, national secretary of the TWU, said this weekend is a repeat of the chaos at Easter:  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting a different outcome. Little action has been taken since Easter to address the serious skills shortages we\u2019ve seen in aviation caused by low wages, poor working conditions and collapsing safety standards. The workers that remain in the industry are under enormous pressure from airports and airlines to plug gaps and keep the gears moving. While the workers that remain are over-worked and stressed out, there\u2019s hundreds of experienced workers forced to sit at home because their jobs were illegally stolen from them by Qantas through its shameful outsourcing. We are an island nation dependent on a viable aviation industry. It\u2019s critical we fix this crisis. Nine long years of inaction has allowed this insecure work rot to set in. The newly minted Albanese Government must move quickly to fix it. Workers need an independent Commission with the power to lift standards and correct power imbalances within the industry. Lifting wages and reversing the skills exodus in aviation must be top of the agenda if we are to sustainably rebuild the industry.    Updated at 5.29am BST    4.58am    Albanese vows to reconsider deportations rules in olive branch to NZ The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has vowed to consider changing how the Australian government handles visa cancellations in an olive branch to ease longstanding tensions with New Zealand. The pledge to look at tweaking the scheme prompted the visiting New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to declare the talks in Sydney on Friday allowed for \u201ca reset\u201d in the trans-Tasman relationship.   Updated at 5.07am BST    4.50am   NSW to upgrade Opal travel card system and trial all-in-one app  The NSW government has committed almost $570m to upgrade the state\u2019s Opal transport system and launching a trial of a new all-in-one transport app, AAP reports. Treasurer Matt Kean made the commitment on Friday ahead of the state budget, to be handed down on 21 June. The $567.9m Opal Next Gen upgrades will make it faster and easier to travel around the state as the government upgrades the Opal system. Commuters will be able to add their Opal cards to their digital wallets, modernising the transport network, Kean said. \u201cSince 2012 more than four billion trips have been taken using Opal, which has transformed the way we travel and it is now time to invest in keeping this system in line with our evolving needs and expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives us a window into the future, setting up the Opal network to keep pace with our changing needs whether that be a train, bus, e-bike, e-scooter, rideshare or even electric vehicle charging.\u201d  The government will also trial a new all-in-one mobility app, Opal Plus, which allows users to bundle together their use of public transport, rideshares, rental e-bikes, taxis and parking. The minister for infrastructure, cities and active transport, Rob Stokes, said the app would revolutionise how people travel as it took into account \u201clast mile journeys\u201d and made it easier to leave the car at home. \u201cOpal Plus will free up people to choose their own adventure when it comes to transport, laying the ground work for an even more intelligent transport system that puts the citizen at its heart,\u201d he said. The app will initially be rolled out to 10,000 people.    Updated at 5.05am BST    4.40am    Dutton and Labor duel over submarines plan Opposition leader Peter Dutton has defended revealing how far along the former government had gone in discussions for securing stop-gap submarines by 2030, stating that what he wrote in an opinion piece in The Australian newspaper was already known, AAP reports. \u201cRichard Marles\u2019 opening comments as defence minister said loud and clear that Labor is thinking about ditching the nuclear submarine plan and it would be a disaster for our country,\u201d he told Nine on Friday. \u201cIf Labor is going to butcher that, and they don\u2019t have the money to pay for it, they should be upfront and say it. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the path they\u2019re taking us down at the moment and ... that is not in our national interest.\u201d Labor minister Tony Burke dismissed Dutton\u2019s claims, saying the government was supportive of the partnership. \u201cWe\u2019re signed up to Aukus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister was straight across to the Quad meeting (in Japan after the election) and the relationship with our key ally in the United States was affirmed immediately.\u201d    Updated at 5.12am BST    4.28am    Eighth monkeypox case in Australia confirmed  A returned overseas traveller has been confirmed as the eighth case of monkeypox detected in Australia, AAP reports. The man, aged in his 40s, returned from Europe before testing positive for the rare viral infection in Victoria. He is isolating as the Victorian health department contacts a small number of his close contacts. The case was confirmed in an alert to the public and health professionals on Friday, issued by Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, associate professor Deborah Friedman. \u201cAnyone developing symptoms that may be consistent with monkeypox should seek medical care, (be) wearing a mask and calling ahead to make sure they can be isolated away from others,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cClinicians should consider testing for monkeypox in returned travellers with compatible symptoms.\u201d The disease can be transmitted from person to person through air droplets, close bodily contact or sharing contaminated linens or objects. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches and exhaustion. Monkeypox is endemic in some parts of Africa but a number of cases have been reported in several countries over the past month. Eight cases have been confirmed in Australia so far, including five in NSW and three in Victoria.

Updated at 4.19am BST    4.13am    Queensland police culture in spotlight at domestic violence inquiry From AAP: Queensland police officers spend nearly half their time responding to and investigating domestic and family violence, but it is not clear their training has led to necessary cultural and structural changes, a judge says. Judge Deborah Richards is heading an independent commission tasked with examining whether \u201ccultural issues\u201d within the Queensland Police Service negatively affect how they respond to domestic and family violence. Speaking at the inquiry\u2019s first sitting in Brisbane on Friday, Judge Richards said statistics from last year found Queensland police spent about 40 per cent of their time responding to and investigating domestic and family violence. \u201cThis must mean that frontline police and those manning the counters and phones at police stations around Queensland make up the public face of the police services that deal with the victim survivors who are the subject of this insidious form of violence,\u201d she said. Officers have been trained, but Judge Richards said it is not clear initiatives are resulting in cultural and structural changes necessary to enhance public confidence in the police response to domestic and family violence.

Updated at 4.13am BST    3.49am    Greenpeace accuses AGL of \u2018disastrous mismanagement\u2019 Greenpeace Australia Pacific has responded to the news that AGL\u2019s Loy Yang A coal-burning power station will be offline until September, on top of additional outages at its Bayswater and Liddell stations. Senior campaigner Glenn Walker says it shows the need for AGL to rapidly embrace renewable energy. It comes as fallout from AGL\u2019s demerger continues, with the energy company today revealing the resignation of Christine Corbett. Walker:  Today\u2019s news shows AGL\u2019s disastrous mismanagement has gone from the company\u2019s boardroom to the living rooms of their customers ... Coal is the dirty rat eating away at household wallets, and if AGL had their way, we\u2019d have a plague. Rather than act in line with the energy transition, AGL instead wasted years and millions of dollars on a dodgy demerger which was never going to work. The results are now plain to see - crumbling assets which cannot deliver the energy Australia needs, and a delay in embracing cleaner, cheaper renewable alternatives. AGL has a clear mandate to seize the urgent and enormous opportunity of the energy transition. The company must appoint new board members that will bring clarity and action, helping to steer AGL into a brighter and greener future.   Updated at 4.40am BST    3.40am   Outage at AGL\u2019s Latrobe Valley power plant to last until September  Not a lot seems to be breaking in the new federal government\u2019s favour when it comes to energy. This morning we learned from AGL Energy that one of its four units at its 2,210 megawatt Loy Yang A power plant in Victoria\u2019s Latrobe Valley will be offline until the second half of September. \u201cThe outage extension is driven by global supply chain issues and the availability of specialised materials,\u201d the company said in a statement. Unit 2 has been offline since an electrical fault was detected on 15 April. It turned out to more complex and so a predicted 1 August restart date of the 550MW unit turned out to be optimistic.  It\u2019s notable, too, that the company won\u2019t be able to claim insurance back from the breakdown. As it happens, AGL is having problems with its two other coal-fired power plants, both in NSW\u2019s Hunter Valley.  Liddell, already down to three units ahead of its planned closure next April, has one of those three offline for repairs. What was a 1680Mw plant is not at half that capacity. Up the valley, partner plant 2,640MW Bayswater plant is also struggling. One of its four units was offline for maintenance, and now we hear that two of the remaining units are down in an unscheduled outage.  That makes five of AGL\u2019s 11 units offline today. No wonder, then, that wholesale prices are high and supply remains tight across much of the national electricity market. Those talking up coal as \u201creliable baseload\u201d might also reconsider whether those words still work together well.

In a statement to the ASX, Crown said it \u201chas been advised by the Western Australian Minister for Racing and Gaming, and the Gaming and Wagering Commission of Western Australia (GWC), that Blackstone\u2019s proposed acquisition of Crown by way of the scheme has been approved\u201d.This follows approval this week from the Victorian and NSW authorities. All that\u2019s left now is approval of the takeover scheme by the federal court, which will hear Blackstone\u2019s application next Wednesday.  Shareholders, including Crown\u2019s biggest, James Packer, approved the takeover last month.   Updated at 3.40am BST    3.20am    \u2018We\u2019re done! Excellent!\u2019 Jacinda Ardern points to another New Zealander to ask a question, asking:   Is that correct or have I miscounted? I would get in a lot of trouble if we didn\u2019t have even numbers from each side.  Anthony Albanese replies he thinks there have been three questions from each. Ardern:  Forgive me. We\u2019re done! Excellent!  Albanese:  I\u2019ve just been through an election, so I can count!  And the press conference ends.  Updated at 3.41am BST    3.18am    NZ can have input to the Quad, Albanese says Anthony Albanese provides his view:   You can have separate agreements, which we do ... there\u2019s no proposals to expand beyond the Quad. But that doesn\u2019t mean that our friends and allies can\u2019t have input through that process. And the relationship between New Zealand and Australia is so strong.   He says something that struck him during yesterday evening\u2019s discussion was that across a range of issues, the pair were talking about solutions:  How do we have open dialogue about what the challenges are? How do we talk about a common interest? Together, I think Australia and New Zealand, acting as one, produces an outcome that\u2019s greater than the sum of the two. And it\u2019s that perspective that I certainly take forward. And I really appreciate the prime minister\u2019s openness and preparedness to have this dialogue.    Updated at 3.37am BST    3.15am    Pacific leaders need more chances to speak for themselves, NZ PM says Both leaders are asked about their positions on security challenges in the Pacific. Is there greater urgency for New Zealand to join groupings like the Quad or Aukus? Jacinda Ardern says New Zealand\u2019s perspective is simple:  We have seen over time new arrangements that have emerged ... as long as these arrangements follow the values which we hold dear, are transparent, and have at their core peace and stability, then we see those as welcome. From New Zealand\u2019s perspective, we have strong bilateral relationships in the region, we have obviously our strongest relationship being with that of Australia, but we want to see an increasing elevation of the Pacific Island voice within our region. That\u2019s where the forum becomes so important. And our approach in raising that voice will be collaborative and one of partnership. We\u2019ve heard a lot of dialogue about the Pacific, not much of a chance for the Pacific to speak for themselves on these issues.   Updated at 3.21am BST    3.13am    Ardern stresses deportation policy needs amending, not scrapping Jacinda Ardern returns to the issue of deportations of New Zealand citizens. She reiterates that New Zealand is not asking for Australia to remove its deportation policy, just to amend it:  I frequently see New Zealand\u2019s ask mischaracterised \u2013 often, I imagine, for domestic political reasons. What we have simply asked is that there\u2019s greater reciprocity. New Zealand, of course, deports individuals who have been in New Zealand for a short time and who have acted outside our expectations for anyone who chooses or wishes to stay as a resident.  But there are who are being deported from Australia who, for all intents and purposes, are Australian. Often zero connection to New Zealand. Sometimes not even having stepped foot there. That\u2019s the place that we\u2019re asking for that consideration to be given. So, anyone who claims that is somehow going to make Australia less safe, that is not true and it is not fair.    Updated at 3.18am BST    3.12am   Australian election signals \u2018reset\u2019 for relations, Ardern says  Jacinda Ardern says she believes the election of Anthony Albanese signals a \u201creset\u201d for relations:  I do see this as an opportunity for a reset because there were obviously some points of friction. There\u2019s obviously still issues to be worked through. But the ability that we have to have those conversations in an open manner, to be able to talk frankly about, of course, the mindfulness that we need to play to domestic issues as well, but just demonstrating that understanding of where that tension has come from and the fact that there are areas where we can find some resolution. Obviously, there\u2019s some work to do. But in my mind, yes, this does represent a reset.   Updated at 3.18am BST    3.10am    Two nations in \u2018lockstep\u2019 over China\u2019s influence in Pacific, Albanese says Anthony Albanese says New Zealand and Australia are in \u201clockstep\u201d on China\u2019s growing influence in the Pacific, and on climate change:  At the Pacific Island Forum, I very much look forward to working not just with New Zealand but our other Pacific partners on making sure that we defend national sovereignty ... that we look at ways in which we can increase development. We had a very comprehensive plan we took to the election that includes over half a billion dollars of foreign aid, it includes planning to train for defence, it includes our climate and infrastructure partnership, including funding.  But, importantly as well, the position on climate change ... we are taking seriously now. You can\u2019t have circumstance whereby you have the former defence minister, now leader of the opposition, standing around and people making jokes about people drowning. Our Pacific neighbours and partners don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny. What they do is see that Australia wasn\u2019t stepping up in a way that\u2019s appropriate and treating them with respect that they deserve.   Updated at 3.15am BST    3.08am    We\u2019re \u2018out of the naughty corner\u2019 on climate, new PM says Anthony Albanese says Australia has been in the \u201cnaughty corner\u201d on the international stage for nine years:  When I have met with international leaders, including prime minister Ardern, it\u2019s like Australia has gone out of the naughty corner. We\u2019ve been in the naughty corner for nine years. And the consequences of that, we are feeling right now with the energy crisis that is here in this country. With the failure to invest in renewables, with the failure to actually deliver on the change that is required.  And the result of that is pressure on cost of living, less jobs, less economic activity as a result of the failure to invest, which is a direct result of the fact there\u2019s been no policy certainty when it comes to climate change and what is necessary.    Updated at 3.14am BST    3.07am   NZ 'heartened' by Labor's climate stance  Jacinda Ardern is asked if she supports Labor\u2019s commitment to deliver 43% emissions reductions by 2030. Should it be higher?  From our perspective, we have always been very careful of the fact that we have to make sure that we have our own house in order, so when it comes to the domestic policies of another nation as in regards to climate change, whilst that is a matter for them, of course, New Zealand is heartened and welcomes the position expressed by the new government here in Australia because it is good for our region and good for the world when we work collaboratively on this extraordinary challenge. The Pacific region has listed climate change as its No 1 threat.   Updated at 3.13am BST    3.05am    Policy won\u2019t change without due process, Albanese says The prime minister is asked to confirm that he\u2019s considering tweaking the ministerial direction to take into account the time a person has been in Australia. And can he rule out reintroducing the strengthening the character test legislation that the Morrison government tried to pass before the election?  I can do no such thing. Because what we won\u2019t do is deal with policy without going through proper processes. I intend to run an orderly government. And I\u2019ve made that point very clear.  Prime minister Ardern has put forward in a strong way, as she has before \u2013 we have discussed these issues previously, when I had a different title. Prime minister Ardern\u2019s concerns are very clear. We\u2019ll work them through in an orderly way. I\u2019ve said that section 501 would be maintained. But if you look at the comments that I made as opposition leader, I stand by them \u2013 that section 501 should be maintained but that there is also concerns have been raised that need to be taken into consideration, as friends.  We deal with each other in a mature way, which deals as well with common sense. And what\u2019s clear is that, if people look at some of the cases that have been held, it\u2019s not surprising that the prime minister would make the strong representations that she had. Because I would be, if I was in the same position.   Updated at 4.02am BST    3.03am   Ardern 'forceful' on views about deportations, Albanese says  Jacinda Ardern says she has \u201cno doubt\u201d Australia and New Zealand will discuss the deportation of NZ citizens over criminal charges in the future, acknowledging it is a new government and they need time to work through the issues:  We\u2019ve really appreciated this opportunity, the chance to catch up ... I\u2019ve never seen a time where it\u2019s more important to have friends than it is now.   Anthony Albanese says Ardern has been \u201cvery forceful\u201d in her views and they will \u201cwork through\u201d those issues with departments to implement the way section 501 has been dealt with:  We will work through some of those issues between now, and we\u2019ll have a ministerial meeting, a leaders\u2019 meeting, coming next month. And we\u2019ll work through with our department, work through the implementation of the way that section 501 has been dealt with. But we\u2019ve listened to the concerns and there\u2019s more work to do.   Updated at 3.10am BST    3.00am    \u2018We are family,\u2019 Ardern says Jacinda Ardern is up, beginning her address in M\u0101ori. She thanks Anthony Albanese for his hospitality and congratulates him on his election success:  I want to, again, in this environment take the opportunity to congratulate you on your election success which, of course, was really only very recent, but much, of course, has happened even in that short intervening period. It is both humbling but also very fitting to be the first foreign head of government to be here in Australia meeting with you in your new role and I think it is indicative of the relationship that New Zealand and Australia share. There are no two countries that I can think of that have a closer relationship than ours and when I say that we are family, I mean it very sincerely.    Updated at 3.09am BST    2.58am    \u2018Ambitious\u2019 climate action Anthony Albanese says Australia and New Zealand will submit an updated nationally determined contribution to the UN convention on climate change:  Australia and New Zealand are also very proud Pacific nations and we value the relations that we have with our Pacific partners very deeply. Our approach is based upon respect, transparency, and engagement with Pacific institutions and we will gather, of course, at the Pacific Island Forum in Fiji in July together.  Prime minister Ardern and I discussed climate change and the ambitious action that my government will take. We will submit, I can confirm today, that we\u2019ll submit an updated nationally determined contribution to the UN framework convention on climate change soon.   Updated at 3.07am BST    2.57am    \u2018We agree on our worldview\u2019 Anthony Albanese says the pair \u201cagree on our worldview\u201d and are determined to take the NZ and Australian relationship to a \u201cnew level\u201d of cooperation in mutual interests of both nations:  What that means is new jobs, new growth, new opportunities to cooperate both in terms of our economy and we had substantial discussions last night, but also this morning about that, but also in the way that we act on the international stage because essentially we agree on our worldview and we can take that position going forward.  Together we face global challenges of a changing climate, economic headwinds, a more insecure regional circumstance that we have to deal with, with strategic competition in the region. And we\u2019re determined to work together on global security, but also on the economic security that people need and also recognising that the challenge of climate change is, of course, also a national security challenge as well as being a challenge for our actual environment, but also an opportunity for us to grow jobs, increase economic activity.   Updated at 3.06am BST    2.55am   Albanese and Ardern press conference beings  Anthony Albanese is up now. He says he is \u201cdelighted\u201d to be fronting up with Jacinda Ardern \u2013 and the pair were able to see the Vivid festival across Sydney Harbour while eating dinner together last night:  I can\u2019t think of anything better than the first foreign leader to welcome to Australia\u2019s shores being our friend from New Zealand and my personal friend from New Zealand as well.  I thank the prime minister once again for calling me even before I had been declared on the Saturday night on the way to the Canterbury Park hotel.  It says something about the relationship, the fact that Jacinda could ring my mobile on the way to that event. It is, of course, a relationship between our two countries as family.   Updated at 3.05am BST    2.49am    Engineering skills crisis due to visa processing delays Australia is in the grip of a skills crisis, including in the engineering sector, where the job vacancy rate has increased 97% in 12 months. But one of the short-term fixes to the problem, skilled migration, is, well, not working.  The processing times for 476 visas \u2013 designed for new graduates who want to live, work or study in Australia for up to 18 months \u2013 has blown out from a few short months to a staggering 41 months since 2018.  That has trapped many engineering graduates out of the country, arguably at a time when they are needed most. Gurpreet Kaur, an engineer based in India\u2019s Punjab state, told Guardian Australia she\u2019s been stuck waiting for almost four years:  I personally applied for this visa back in September 2018 and am still waiting for my visa grant. Despite meeting all the criteria, paying the application fee, medical assessment fees, there are still a lot of applicants like me from Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh and many more countries \u2026 about 6,000 applicants are waiting for their grant. Waiting for three to four years, it\u2019s a really frustrating situation, and I think it\u2019s a moral duty of any government, because this is unfair to us. We have planned all our career plans, we are suffering, not only professionally but it is a mental depression also.  India\u2019s high commissioner to Australia, Manpreet Vohra, has also described visa processing delays as a problem.  I believe it\u2019s a problem, but only because of staff shortages and backlog built up because of the pandemic.   Prime minister Anthony Albanese described the visa backlog as \u201cextraordinary\u201d, saying it had also been raised during his trip to Indonesia this week:  This is an issue that, upon coming to government without going into other issues, we have found it isn\u2019t just in this area, we have a problem processing visas. There is just an extraordinary backlog.   Updated at 2.55am BST    2.39am    Darcy, take a bow A day before the election, Guardian Australia invited readers to tell us who they thought would win \u2013 asking you to forecast the final number of seats for both major parties, as well as select the winner in 10 marginal electorates. We had 812 entries and no one managed to pick the exact result, although Darcy, a 24-year-old legal and compliance analyst from Melbourne came oh so close.  He was one of 77 readers to correctly pick Labor\u2019s 77 seats (spooky!), and tipped the Coalition to win 59 seats. They won 58, which only four readers accurately forecast.  Reflecting on his success, Darcy said he would \u201ctake it as a justification for my over-consumption of the news\u201d:  Living in a now-teal seat, I was reminded daily of the threat to the Coalition \u2013 in the form of human billboards \u2013 so maybe that crept into my thinking.  Despite his eerily accurate overall forecast, Darcy only managed to correctly pick five of the 10 electorates provided, proving how difficult an election it was to predict, with so many seats in play.  Only seven of the 812 readers managed to pick the winners of all 10 seats correctly.

Updated at 2.35am BST    2.23am    The PM and Jacinda Ardern are due to hold a press conference in Sydney shortly. We\u2019ll bring you the updates here.     2.22am    Stay safe out there if you\u2019re hitting the roads in NSW for the long weekend.       2.15am    \u2018No one wants to be in a queue but it\u2019s better than being locked up at home\u2019 Dominic Perrottet has thanked travellers for their patience at Sydney airport, where people experienced major delays this morning.  He said labour shortages that were contributing to the issues would be top of the list when he travelled to Canberra to speak with the new prime minister next week:  I thank everyone for their patience this morning. I know that there were long queues at the airport this morning. But on the flip side, isn\u2019t it great that everyone is back ... I accept that no one wants to be in a queue but it\u2019s better than being locked up at home. Labour shortages need to be addressed and they can\u2019t be addressed necessarily at a state level. It needs to be nationally led.   Updated at 2.21am BST    2.05am    NSW announces it will give $28m to multicultural groups The New South Wales government will invest $28m over the next two years into multicultural communities across the state, including more money for events and translation services.  Speaking in Eastwood on Friday morning, premier Dominic Perrottet also announced the establishment of a religious communities advisory council:  We should not have any environment where people of faith do not feel comfortable. This advisory council will provide insights to the government about ways in which we can improve ways in which our faith-based communities across NSW feel safe and secure in the practice of religion.  Multiculturalism minister Mark Coure said its \u201cfirst order\u201d of businesswould be to make sure people of faith felt comfortable practising their religion. Of the $28m for multicultural groups, $10m will go to boosting cultural events and $16m will go to increasing translation services \u2013 a need he said had been highlighted during the pandemic.  Perrottet:   Our community here in NSW is incredibly rich and diverse, and multicultural communities play an important role in enabling our great society here in our state to flourish.

Updated at 2.02am BST    1.58am    Warning of floods in northern NSW From the BoM:  Moderate to heavy local rainfall in mid May, combined with floodwaters from Queensland, have caused renewed and prolonged flooding along the Culgoa, Birrie, Bokhara and Narran Rivers. Along the Culgoa River, moderate flooding is occurring at Brenda, where river levels peaked at the major flood level on Sunday. Small, renewed rises are possible this weekend from a second peak past Woolerbilla. Minor flooding is occurring at Weilmoringle, where major flooding is likely from Sunday. These floodwaters may also cause major flooding downstream at Kenebree around the end of next week. At Hebel, river levels peaked on Saturday and are contributing to renewed moderate flooding along the Birrie and Bokhara Rivers at Goodooga, where a moderate flood peak is occurring. Major flooding continues at Angeldool.    Updated at 2.04am BST    1.49am    The Shangri-La Dialogue line-up has been released.

The independent commission, announced by premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in response to the women\u2019s safety and justice taskforce recommendations, started work on 30 May. It will examine whether \u201ccultural issues\u201d within the Queensland police service negatively affect investigations of domestic and family violence. The commission will look at the over-representation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system and the police\u2019s capability, capacity and structure to respond to domestic and family violence. The way complaints against police are handled will also be examined. The deadline for submissions to the independent inquiry has been extended to 24 June. The commission of inquiry, expected to take four months, is due to report by 4 October and has a budget of $3.4m.

Updated at 1.56am BST    12.58am    Covid vaccinations rates A little more than half of senior Australians eligible for their fourth Covid-19 vaccination have received it, AAP reports. Federal government figures released yesterday show just 52.2% of the eligible population aged 65 and over have received their fourth jab for the virus, equating to more than 1.6 million people. That was up 1.6% on the same time last week. In total and accounting for those aged under 65, more than 1.8 million Australians have received at least four doses of a Covid-19 vaccine.  Updated at 1.57am BST    12.49am    Snowy Hydro delay While not the biggest surprise, a report in the AFR this morning that Snowy Hydro\u2019s giant pumped hydro plans might be delayed until \u201caround 2028\u201d is nonetheless stirring the energy debate anew. Analysts including Melbourne University\u2019s Dylan McConnell and Bruce Mountain of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre have long queried the insistence by the Australian Energy Market Operator in its detailed plans that Snowy 2.0 would be ready when the grid needs it.  For instance, Aemo\u2019s latest Electricity Statement of Opportunities report has a \u201cDevelopments needed to address forecast reliability gaps\u201d section.  It states the case for work on the Humelink connection to the project as:  Development of transmission projects that increase the ability to transfer power from regions into the Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong area. Such upgrades are particularly relevant to access the reliability benefits of the expected commissioning of the Snowy 2.0 development in 2025-26.  \u201cIt will make for an interesting update to the ESoO \u2013 due in August,\u201d McConnell says, adding that news of Snowy\u2019s delay should be considered a significant enough \u201cmaterial change\u201d to trigger a rerun of the whole process. We\u2019ve asked Aemo this morning about what they think of the delay of Snowy by \u201cabout 19 months\u201d, although you have to wonder at the precision, given the engineering challenges of building a power station almost a kilometres below the surface, 27km-long tunnels and a range of other massive works \u2013 all within a national park! One other nugget: as interesting as this delay is to the energy market \u2013 not least because of last week\u2019s crisis when Victoria almost ran short of gas \u2013 a possible delay for Snowy 2.0 was not discussed at Wednesday\u2019s energy ministers\u2019 meeting. Given that most of the meeting was taken up by regulators talking about the state of the energy markets, that\u2019s another eyebrow raiser. As it happens, electricity markets were again pricey this morning, especially in Queensland.  They\u2019ve settled down a bit since \u2026 but one factor was a bunch of alerts (now cancelled) for a lack of reserve power in NSW.   Conditions on another chilly morning were tight ... and it looks as though the chill has another week to go (at least if you\u2019re camping in Sydney).  Updated at 1.59am BST    12.41am    Hello, fogbow OK, if you\u2019re flying from Melbourne or Sydney to warmer Queensland, you may receive a surprise. In the form of a fogbow:  From the BoM:  Fogs can ... produce a type of rainbow known as a fogbow. They form in the same way as rainbows, with the sun\u2019s rays being refracted and reflected by the water droplets in the fog.  However, fog droplets are typically much smaller than the rain drops that form rainbows. This leads to smaller amounts of refraction and reflection so the colours in a fogbow are less distinct and often appear to be white.

Updated at 12.30am BST    12.19am    Ukraine seeks free trade deal with Australia Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Australia is seeking to meet with ministers to discuss trade and aid opportunities after returning from the war-torn country, AAP reports. Vasyl Myroshnychenko has returned to Australia after an eight-day trip to Ukraine where he met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s top advisers, the prime minister, the defence minister and military officials.  Myroshnychenko has called for a free trade agreement between Australia and Ukraine, and says while it is likely to play a largely symbolic role, it will be important to encourage private and public investment in his country to help with its recovery. The ambassador is seeking to brief Australian ministers on the situation with Ukraine and ask for more lethal aid and economic assistance. He told AAP:  Co-operation with Australia to help rebuild Ukraine is crucial. We are like-minded countries. We hope there will be mechanisms that allow investors from countries like Australia to come in and help rebuild the country.  The bilateral trade deal could be modelled on the UK free trade agreement and be completed within a year, Myroshnychenko says. Such a deal was raised with the previous government but talks stalled as Australia headed into the federal election and caretaker conventions took over.  The ambassador will bring three pillars to any meetings with Australian ministers, calling for more lethal aid, free trade and investment, and further sanctions on Russia and Russian individuals.  Myroshnychenko has also returned with a personal letter for Anthony Albanese from President Zelenskiy, congratulating the new prime minister and inviting him to visit Ukraine.  Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong spoke with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba at the start of the month, when he requested additional heavy weapons and proposed the inclusion of Ukraine in Australia\u2019s \u201cgeneralised system of preferences\u201d to bolster the economy.

There have been 8,025 new cases reported and 19 further deaths. There are 512 people being treated in hospital with the virus, including 28 people in ICU.

Updated at 2.05am BST    11.55pm    \u2018Triple La Ni\u00f1a\u2019 warning Australia\u2019s east coast could be hit by a rare \u201ctriple La Ni\u00f1a\u201d that brings flooding rains and cooler weather for the third summer in a row, a senior US government scientist says. Experts say the prospect is real but there is disagreement between different computer models and Australia could yet avoid a return of summer floods. Scientists and weather forecasters are watching temperatures in an area in the tropical Pacific Ocean that has been unusually cool \u2013 one signal that the current La Ni\u00f1a could either remain in place until summer or fade and then return.   Updated at 2.06am BST    11.49pm    Victorian Liberal MP Matthew Guy has tested positive to Covid.      11.47pm    Helen Haines says she will work with government on integrity commission Independent MP Helen Haines is appearing on Radio National now, discussing a federal integrity commission.  Haines introduced a federal integrity commission bill to parliament in 2020, and is expected to be a key player in the Labor government\u2019s establishment of an anti-corruption body. She says she has put forward the establishment of a joint select committee to facilitate the process to attorney general Mark Dreyfus, of which she would be the co-chair:  I had a conversation with the attorney general a few days after the election and I was reassured by him he wants to work very closely with me ... to make sure we get the integrity commission that is fit for purpose. I\u2019m awaiting, really, now, the next steps to undertake that work with the attorney. [I\u2019ve had] one conversation thus far with Mr Dreyfus, he was very open to that suggestion [a committee], as yet we haven\u2019t got that nailed down and I\u2019ll be pursuing that.  Haines says she supports the inclusion of pork barrelling to the commission and it is part of why people have \u201clost trust\u201d with the government.  Updated at 2.07am BST    11.36pm    Celebrations planned in Biloela Reporter Eden Gillespie and photographer Mike Bowers will be covering the Nadesalingam family\u2019s long-awaited return to Biloela today for us.  A reminder: the family will arrive at Thangool airport about 2.30pm, where Priya Nadesalingam and members of the Home to Bilo campaign will speak.    Updated at 2.07am BST    11.30pm    Gillard tells Albanese to look after himself Beyond Blue chair and former prime minister Julia Gillard appeared on ABC News Breakfast this morning with words of advice for Australia\u2019s newly sworn-in leader. Asked what the biggest challenges for Anthony Albanese were, she replied:  Well, at the rate our new prime minister appears to be working at the moment, I think getting enough sleep might be the biggest challenge. Words of advice \u2013 make sure you\u2019re looking after yourself as well.  She said there was \u201cno need\u201d to share her learnings of dealing with a large crossbench as the PM was at the heart of the government she led:  He knows what it\u2019s like in terms of dealing with people respectfully across the chamber.   Updated at 2.08am BST    11.24pm   Crowds and chaos at Sydney and Melbourne airports  Here\u2019s some more footage of chaos at Sydney airport, as travellers find themselves in lengthy crowds before the long weekend.   There are similar scenes in Melbourne:   Updated at 2.08am BST    11.18pm    Ardern has no plans to become an Australian Jacinda Ardern is told Australians \u201clove welcoming Kiwis \u2013 especially claiming the good ones as our own\u201d. She laughs politely. \u201cYou could end up an Australian one day!,\u201d she is told. Ardern:  No, there\u2019s no prospect of that happening. Thank you, though.  \u201cThat\u2019s the firmest answer we\u2019ve had this morning,\u201d the host replies.  Updated at 1.50am BST    11.17pm    The Pacific is our family, Ardern says On China\u2019s move to tell NZ to stop interfering in the Pacific, Jacinda Ardern says she takes the same view that she always has:  We are a Pacific nation. Our connections in the Pacific, they run deep. They are family. We have large Pacific communities in New Zealand ... Pacific members of parliament, Pacific ministers. So the relationship for us is not a bilateral relationship; it\u2019s a family relationship. And so I don\u2019t see our relationship as ever being able to be described as interference. We have a closeness to one another that will always be the case.  Ardern says there is \u201cpower in the collective\u201d, while the Pacific Island Forum will be critical for neighbours to speak for themselves:  I do think it\u2019s time that actually there is an opportunity for our Pacific neighbours to speak for themselves. There\u2019s a lot of commentary around what\u2019s happening in the region. Very little opportunity for them to speak to it. [China\u2019s] presence is not new. The relationship that they have with the Pacific islands is not new. It\u2019s whether or not they are seeking to change those relationships to dip into spaces like, for instance, the potential militarisation of our region and that\u2019s ... where of course you hear that concern being raised but off the back of those recent trips you also saw that the Pacific held its ground on security arrangements, and that again speaks to the fact that the Pacific are speaking and sharing their own views.   Updated at 1.48am BST    11.12pm   Ardern to raise deportations policy  Jacinda Ardern will be raising Australia\u2019s controversial deportation policy in today\u2019s meeting. Asked if she has knowledge of whether the government is prepared to \u201cwater it down a little bit\u201d, she replies:  Just to be clear, the issue we have is not with deportation. We deport as well. If a New Zealander comes to Australia and commits a crime, send them home ... but when someone comes here and essentially, hasn\u2019t even really had any connection with New Zealand at all ... have all their connections in Australia and are essentially Australian, sending them back to New Zealand, that\u2019s where we\u2019ve had the grievance. I\u2019ve heard the prime minister prior to winning the election speak to his acknowledgement that that is the part of the policy that we\u2019ve taken issue with. Even that acknowledgement says to me he\u2019s hearing us, he knows it\u2019s a problem. We\u2019ve never asked deportations as a general rule to stop. We won\u2019t be hypocritical about it, because we do it too. It\u2019s just those extraordinary cases that trouble us.  Asked if there will be movements with the discretionary aspect of it, she says she has raised it and wants to give Anthony Albanese time to consider it:  It\u2019s been a bugbear for us for a long time so I would like to see movement on it.    Updated at 1.47am BST    11.09pm    Ardern says vinyl swap was \u2018mostly by chance\u2019 New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern just appeared on the Today show before this morning\u2019s meeting with Anthony Albanese. On the vinyl swap, Ardern says it was \u201cmostly by chance\u201d \u2013 she knew he liked music so she shared some favourites from the New Zealand indie label Flying Nun. Asked why this didn\u2019t happen with Scott Morrison, she replies:  We talked about music on occasion but I\u2019m not sure I would\u2019ve picked necessarily the right music if I think I was given that task.   Updated at 1.46am BST    11.06pm    Transmission is the energy problem, not renewables, Burke says On climate change, Tony Burke was told he had been getting \u201chot and bothered\u201d about renewables (??) but if it weren\u2019t for gas and coal South Australia would have lost power last week. \u201cAre you going to shift that policy as well?\u201d Burke said Australia lost a decade in climate action under the Coalition and the transition to renewables should have started a long time ago:  We were stuck in climate wars where Barnaby Joyce was effectively running energy policy, we\u2019ve ended up with a situation where the transmission and the grid\u2019s not able to handle renewables the way it should. Renewables are the cheapest form of energy. We need to fix transmission so we can get more into the system. We will be relying on on coal and gas for some time, there\u2019s no doubt about that [but] the worst thing you could do would be to say, let\u2019s add the most expensive form of energy, which is nuclear, which is what Pete is talking about.  Peter Dutton replied that the difficulty was you don\u2019t have a \u201cfirming up\u201d of renewables when the sun isn\u2019t shining or the wind isn\u2019t blowing:  We\u2019re all in favour of renewables but the difficulty is that this is not a discussion at the moment about renewables. Everyone\u2019s signed up to that. It\u2019s what you do to firm up the market.  Burke said we have water when it isn\u2019t raining, which, under Dutton\u2019s argument, would be some sort of impossibility:  How do we have water when it\u2019s not raining? We have dams, we have storage.   Updated at 1.45am BST    11.04pm    Dutton says Coalition will support Labor on immigration Peter Dutton said when Tony Burke was immigration minister \u201cabout 6,000 people arrived, so people smugglers aren\u2019t stupid\u201d:  They\u2019re organised criminal syndicates. They\u2019re evil people, taking money off innocent men, women and children. What we don\u2019t want to see is a repeat of Labor\u2019s last disaster. So the mixed messages coming out of the government that are heard in places like Sri Lanka are concerning, because not everybody within the Labor party is singing from the same hymn sheet that Tony is, and that\u2019s the difficulty.  But we\u2019ll support whatever policies the government puts forward. I hope that they don\u2019t change what we had in place, because we had got all of the children out of detention that Labor put in, we\u2019d stopped the boats, stopped the drownings at sea, and I don\u2019t want to see it restart, but the people smugglers know that the same people are now in government who made terrible decisions before, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re preying on.  Burke replied that the Coalition\u2019s turnbacks policy was \u201cthe right policy\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be changing under Labor.   Updated at 1.44am BST    11.02pm    Tony Burke says no change to boat arrival policies Federal employment minister Tony Burke and opposition leader Peter Dutton appeared on Sunrise this morning. Asked if Labor would alter its asylum seeker policy, with \u201cproblems in Sri Lanka\u201d and \u201cmore boats\u201d, Burke said the government\u2019s policy wouldn\u2019t change:  People who try to come by boat get turned around and sent back. That\u2019s what happens. In the previous government, one good thing that they came up with was how to handle this issue. There were things we\u2019d done that had reduced it from its peak but when they came up with a way of being able to do the turnbacks, it was a good idea. I\u2019d say to the opposition, every time they want to say, \u2018Oh, the doors are open,\u2019 or something like that, they might be trying to send a message, trying to encourage them. The policy hasn\u2019t changed and won\u2019t change.   Updated at 2.28am BST    10.55pm    Emergency response fund \u2018very close\u2019 to being spent Murray Watt was asked if he has spent money from the emergency response fund to aid flood victims.  He said it was \u201cvery close\u201d to being spent and would be split evenly between New South Wales and Queensland.    Updated at 1.42am BST    10.50pm    Albanese and Ardern trade vinyl AAP has more on Anthony Albanese\u2019s meeting with Jacinda Ardern in Sydney, as the fast-paced start to his prime ministership continues. The New Zealand prime minister is the first world leader to meet with the new PM on Australian soil. The pair will hold talks before a joint press conference at 11.20am AEST. Last night the Labor-Labour duo had dinner at Kirribilli House, taking in the views of Sydney\u2019s Vivid festival and swapping gifts of vinyl records.  Albanese gave Ardern three Australian albums from Midnight Oil, Spiderbait and Powderfinger. The NZ PM gave a selection of records from indie label Flying Nun, including Aldous Harding, Reb Fountain, the Clean and the 70s Auckland punk compilation AK79.  For the Australian government, the engagement is seen as a meet-and-greet with a key regional ally. The pair will discuss tensions in the region, and US president Joe Biden\u2019s new Indo-Pacific economic framework initiative. But for New Zealand, any bilateral meeting with Australia is also a chance to press for concessions from its most important partner. The significance of the relationship is underscored in a NZ ministry of foreign affairs brief received by foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta when she took office in 2020:  The trans-Tasman relationship lies at the heart of New Zealand\u2019s prosperity and security and Australia is our indispensable partner across the breadth of our international interests. Australia is our only formal military ally, our most important security partner and our largest economic partner \u2013 the reverse is not the case.  The asymmetric relationship is clear in terms of population \u2013 Australia\u2019s is five times bigger \u2013 and economically \u2013 Australia has a gross domestic product seven times larger. Ardern has pledged to bring up two issues which cause grief among New Zealanders. The first is Australia\u2019s practice of deporting criminals to New Zealand who do not have familial or community ties in Aotearoa. Her government believes many of those deportees arrive untethered, without support networks, and can become destitute or join gangs. The second issue is an improved pathway to citizenship for New Zealanders who live in Australia, which would grant them more security across the Tasman.  Updated at 1.42am BST    10.46pm    Airport queues return Travellers across the nation are bracing for lengthy airport lines before the long weekend, with passengers urged to arrive two hours early for domestic flights. There are long lines at Melbourne and Sydney airports this morning.    Updated at 10.55pm BST    10.42pm    Murray Watt visits Lismore to talk about flood recovery Minister for emergency management Murray Watt is appearing on Radio National from Lismore, an area devastated by flooding this year.  He says the opposition always wants to \u201cpick a fight\u201d before forming solutions, and he wants to put the \u201cblame game and division\u201d behind them in the recovery.  Watt says it was important to get out to Lismore as quickly as he could after being sworn in:  It is a pretty chilly morning here in Lismore and that\u2019s a reminder there\u2019s going to be new challenges for these communities to deal with as they recover. I wanted to get back here to see for myself where things are at and what we can do to get the recovery moving more quickly.  Watt will hold a series of roundtables today with with community leaders, business leaders and insurers looking at, among other things, thousands of people still living in temporary accommodation.  They\u2019re really, really cold \u2013 sitting in caravans, sitting in temporary accommodation. We really want to get a real snapshot of where things are at and what we can do to get this community back up and running. There are still many people who are displaced from their homes and frankly it\u2019s going to take awhile ... we\u2019re going to do everything we can in cooperation with other levels of government ... but I don\u2019t want to mislead people, it\u2019s going to take time.   Updated at 10.54pm BST    10.38pm   Good morning  Happy Friday! We\u2019ve almost made it. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and New Zealand\u2019s leader Jacinda Ardern will sit down in Sydney today for their first in-person meeting.  They are expected to discuss a host of issues including Australia\u2019s controversial deportation policy, which has kicked thousands of New Zealanders with criminal records out of the country. Ardern will be the first foreign leader to visit Albanese on his soil since he won the election.  The Nadesalingam family will arrive home to the central Queensland town of Biloela today after four years in detention. The timing of the journey means Tharnicaa, who was just nine months old when she entered detention, will celebrate her fifth birthday in Biloela on Sunday. Refugees living in limbo hope the family\u2019s release will grant them a future as well. And former defence minister Peter Dutton has been used of working against the national interest for \u201cpolitical point scoring\u201d after publishing sensitive details of a plan to secure two nuclear submarines in the US in the media. Diplomatic figures have condemned his disclosure, suggesting it could destroy plans to secure a joint agreement with the UK at the end of the year.

                    "body": "\n 5.51pm  \nAfternoon summary\n\n\nBoris Johnson has thrown his weight behind offshore wind in the drive to produce more electricity in the UK. In evidence to the Commons liaison committee, he said: \u201cYou have got to recognise that in the UK we have just failed, for a generation, to put in enough long-term supply\u201d. He went on:\n\n\nIt\u2019s been one of those colossal mistakes. Renewables are fantastic: offshore wind \u2013 and I stress offshore wind \u2013 I think has massive potential. But so does nuclear.\n\nJohnson also told the committee that small nuclear reactors could be producing power for the UK by the end of the decade. (See 4.14pm.)\n\nThe UK government has announced plans to block ferries with crews paid less than the minimum wage from British ports in response to widespread fury to P&amp;O Ferries\u2019 sacking of 800 workers without consultation. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said the announcement from Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, meant the government had abandoned the commitment given by Boris Johnson to take the firm to court.\n\n\nIn the chamber, in response to Haigh, Shapps said:\n\nShe asks about court action and why the government hasn\u2019t taken any. It\u2019s because the government is not in the position to take the court action \u2013 that\u2019s for the unions and workers, and we understand the limitations of that and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve described some of the items here.\n\nAndy McDonald, a former shadow transport secretary, gave a qualified welcome to the plans.\n\nBut the RMT transport union said the measures were \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. In a statement its general secretary, Mick Lynch, said:\n\nThe prime minister repeatedly said to parliament that the government would be taking legal action save British seafarers\u2019 jobs but he has failed to keep his word.\nThis continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people\u2019s lives with impunity and we will keep pressing the government to ensure justice for our members.\nWhat has been announced today is far too little, far too late and we are calling for urgent action for speedier more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.\n\n\nJamie Wallis has become the first MP to come out as trans, revealing he was diagnosed with gender dysphoria from a young age but wanted to show \u201chow important it is to be yourself\u201d.\n\n\nMinisters have been accused of using more than \u00a3100,000 of public money to flood local newspapers and Facebook with \u201cTory propaganda\u201d, with just weeks to go before the local elections.\n\n\nEight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin were granted \u201cgolden visas\u201d to live in Britain.\n\n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has announced that Scotland\u2019s rules on compulsory mask-wearing will remain in force until 18 April.\n\n\nPublic satisfaction with the NHS has sunk to its lowest level since 1997, with just 36% of voters content with the way the health service is run and performing.\n\n\nDominic Raab said he plans to appeal against the Parole Board\u2019s decision to free the mother of Baby P, who died after months of abuse.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.02pm BST\n\n\n 5.39pm  \n\nSenior economists have reacted with surprise at the government\u2019s decision not to raise benefits in last week\u2019s spring statement, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nThe Treasury committee were told that chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s measures will leave the poorest, out-of-work households the worst-off group from his support packages.\nTorsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation (RF) think tank, said: \u201cI was very surprised that the chancellor had chosen the overall package he had when it came to what was on offer for lower-income households.\u201d\nHe pointed out that lower-income households will feel the pressure from rising energy bills - which is driving inflation.\nThe economist added: \u201cIt is an odd choice to have offered basically next to nothing to those households in this spring statement. I didn\u2019t think he would do that and I was wrong.\u201d\nThe RF has calculated that the cost of living crisis will push 1.3 million households into absolute poverty.\nMiddle-income households can expect to see disposable income fall 4% next year after housing costs.\nFor those in the poorest quarter, income falls 6%, and for out-of-work households it falls by 8%, the RF has said.\nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), agreed with an uprate in benefits and said there are mechanisms available to do it.\nHe told MPs: \u201cThese are really big falls in the real living standards for households that are budgeting over relatively short periods of time. It would be better [to raise benefits] than doing nothing.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 6.02pm BST\n\n\n 4.51pm  \n\nThis is from Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for climate and net zero, on Boris Johnson\u2019s evidence to the liaison committee.\n\n\n\n\n 4.49pm  \n\nQ: The OBR says trade intensity in the UK - the amount of trade being carried out - went down very sharply when the pandemic struck. But other countries saw their trade intensity do up again. The UK\u2019s hasn\u2019t. Does that mean Brexit is turning the UK into a closed economy?\nJohnson says he does not want that. He says growing our own food is good, but he is not a believer in autarky. He wants to see an export drive. Many UK companies could sell more overseas than they do.\nQ: How long will it take for trade intensity to get back to pre-pandemic levels?\nJohnson says there is no natural impediment to exports. It is just will and ambition, he claims.\n(It is not just will and ambition. Non-tariff barriers - all the new red tape affecting exporters since Brexit - are a key factor.)\nAnd that\u2019s it. The hearing is over.\n\nUpdated at 4.51pm BST\n\n\n 4.37pm  \n\nMel Stride (Con) is doing the questioning now.\nQ: Will you consider speeding up the benefit uprating process, so claminats do not have to wait more than a year for benefits to go up in line with inflation? This happened in the 1970s?\nJohnson says he is happy to ask the Treasury to look at that. But he stresses the measure being taken to help claimants, and does not sound over-keen on the idea.\n\n\n\n 4.35pm  \nJohnson says reducing number of children in poverty should be part of levelling up agenda\n\nCatherine McKinnell (Lab) says 75% of children in poverty in the UK live in working households.\nAnd she says, when Johnson quoted figures are PMQs for poverty going down, that was from 2010. Poverty is now projected to rise, she says.\nQ: Can you level up the country without reducing the number of children living in poverty?\nNo, says Johnson.\n(If Johnson means this, it is a new commitment. The current levelling up targets do not cover poverty.)\nHe says there is an issue the government must fix.\nHe says there are 200,000 children in absolute poverty. \nAt the moment the cost of living is running too high. That is why the government must abate it, he says.\nHe says the best way forward is to get more people into higher paid jobs.\nQ: How many times is child poverty mentioned in the levelling up white paper?\nJohnson says he thinks McKinnell will tell him the answer is none.\nQ: It is none.\nJohnson says, if that is the case, it is a \u201cpurely formal accident\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 4.42pm BST\n\n\n 4.27pm  \n\nQ: Why are you not helping people on universal credit who are facing a real-terms cut because benefits are going up by less than inflation?\nJohnson says the government has made the UC taper rate more generous.\nQ: But that does not help people out of work.\nJohnson says most people on UC are in work, or are capable of work.\nHe says the government thinks work is the route out of poverty for people.\n\n\n\n 4.24pm  \n\nStephen Timms (Lab) goes next.\nQ: Do you accept that you were wrong to say the number of people in employment now is higher than before the pandemic?\nJohnson says he accepts he has been reprimanded on this. He says at PMQs today he was careful to talk about payroll employment.\nQ: Have you corrected the record?\nJohnson says he thinks he did.\n(If he did, then most of us missed it.)\n\n\n\n 4.19pm  \n\nInsider\u2019s Cat Neilan has this on why Bill Wiggin was so interested in the visa rules for Qataris. (See 3.53pm.)\n\n\n\n\n 4.16pm  \n\nClive Betts (Lab) goes next.\nQ: You are using council tax rebates to deliver help to people with fuel bills. But some poorer tenants pay their council tax with their rent. Their rebates will go to the landlords, who could be collection multiple council tax rebates.\nJohnson says he had not foreseen that \u201cwrinkle\u201d. He says he will look into this.\nQ: Can you ensure regulations are written so the tenants get the help?\nJohnson says everyone would agree with that.\n\n\n\n 4.14pm  \nJohnson says small nuclear reactors could be producing power for UK by end of decade\n\nPhilip Dunne (Con) goes next.\nQ: To what extent will the energy security strategy address cost of living problems?\nJohnson says it is important to address the problems people have. He sums up some of the measures announced. \nBut we have to recognise that in the UK \u201cwe have just failed for a generation to put in enough long-term supply\u201d.\nHe says offshore wind has \u201cmassive potential\u201d, as does nuclear.\n(He stresses that he is talking about offshore wind. He is understood to be opposed to allowing more onshore wind turbines.)\n\nHe recalls reading the Ladybird book on nuclear power. And who\u2019s fault was it there was not enough investment? Labour\u2019s, he says.\nHe says they need to invest in \u201cbig ticket\u201d nuclear projects, as well as smaller plants, SMRs (small modular reactors).\nQ: How long could it be before an SMR is contributing to the grid?\nJohnson says he has seen a briefing saying eight years. \n\nI saw a bit of paper last night saying that they think \u2018before the end of the decade\u2019 - but they will have to go quicker than that ... If we don\u2019t start now, we won\u2019t be fixing the problem.\n\nBut he says the vaccine rollout showed how they country can do things very quickly.\n\nUpdated at 5.36pm BST\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\nThe commitee is now questioning Johnson about the cost of living.\nNeil Parish (Con) starts.\nQ: Food prices are going up because of the war. What can we do to help farmers produce more food domestically?\nJohnson stresses his support for farming. His grandfather was a farmer, he says. He says he speaks to farmers, and they are disappointed their children are not going into it.\nBritish embassies now have officials helping to promote farming exports, he says.\nQ: Fertiliser costs four times what it did a year ago. That adds to the cost of food. We only produce 40% of the fertiliser we need. Can we reopen the fertiliser plant that has closed?\nJohnson says hydrocarbons contribute to the costs for farmers. The UK has to reduce its reliance on Russian oil.\n(Johnson is transparently waffling now. He is clearly not briefed on this topic.)\n\n\n\n 3.59pm  \n\nClive Betts (Lab) is asking the questions now.\nQ: Two weeks ago the home affairs committee was told councils would get \u00a310,000 for refugees coming through the family scheme, and for refugees coming through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. But this morning Lord Harrington, the refugee minister, told the levelling up committee that people coming through families scheme would not attract this support.\nJohnson confirms this, but he says Ukrainians will be allowed to work. He says the government thinks different types of people will come under the different schemes. And the distribution of refugees is not even, he says. He claims that some Scottish councils are not taking refugees.\n\n\n\n 3.53pm  \n\nSir Bill Wiggin (Con) goes next.\nQ: Why is the Homes for Ukraine scheme moving so slowly?\nJohnson says there are processing 1,000 applications a day. He says he expects it to speed up.\nBut officials have to balance different objectives, he says. They have to carry out checks.\nSome people coming out of the war zone may not be who they say they are, he says. He says there have been a few cases of this already.\nQ: We have promised Qataris visa-free access. But that is not happening. Why are we not getting the migrants we want, like Ukrainians and Qataris, but people on boats?\nJohnson says he does want a \u201cmuch more fluid\u201d visa system for Qatar. Progress is likely soon, he says.\nQ: You said you wanted a light-touch system. What can you do to make sure you wish becomes your command?\nJohnson says they can increase the number of visa application centres in country and put things online. That is what they are doing. They are paying to sent officials out to countries like Poland, he says.\n\nUpdated at 4.16pm BST\n\n\n 3.45pm  \n\nDiana Johnson (Lab) goes next.\nShe says the Homes for Ukraine scheme requires people to fill in a 30-page visa. She says only one in 100 visa applications have resulted in a visa being issued. How many people have actually arrived under these visas?\nJohnson says he does not know the arrival figures.\nHe says the visa numbers are expected to go up.\nQ: A heavily pregant woman matched under the Homes for Ukraine scheme has been told to stay and have her baby in Poland before she comes to the UK.\nJohnson says he does not see why she should not have the baby in the UK. He will look into it, he says.\n\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\nJulian Knight (Con) goes next.\nHe says the culture committee has heard evidence about how much disinformation is supplied to the Russian people.\nJohnson agrees. He describes the \u201cruthlessness\u201d with which President Putin is concealing what is happening. He says you can ring Russian friends, and they genuinely believe the lies Putin is telling them.\nQ: Shouldn\u2019t all our news media focus on getting the truth into Russia?\nJohnson says the government is increasing funding for the BBC, and doing what it can to counter Russian disinformation. There are \u201csome signs it is getting through\u201d, he claims. There is a \u201cgrowing awareness\u201d in Russia of what is happening.\nQ: There is nothing to stop Russia launching a new version of RT. Do we need a clearer definition of publisher in the online safety bill.\nJohnson says he knows this is an issue Knight is following closely. The bill will define a publisher.\nQ: It is likely that Telegram will not be considered a high-risk publisher? Should it be included?\nJohnson says his general feeling is that anyone putting stuff online in a systematic way should be defined as a news publisher, and subject to the controls in the bill.\nQ: Nadine Dorries wants to set up a new committee to monitor online safety. That would undermine the culture committee. Will you look into this?\nJohnson says committees are a matter for the house, but he says he will write to Knight about this.\n\nUpdated at 3.43pm BST\n\n\n 3.32pm  \n\nJohnson says, as the Ukrainians push back Russian forces, there have been \u201cabsolutely horrifying\u201d accounts of what the Russians have done.\nChampion says the Russians have been using sexual violence. What is the UK doing to tackle this. Is there a PSVI (preventing sexual violence in conflict initiative) team on the ground?\nJohnson says the UK has a team in the region. He says the UK pioneered work on this when William Hague was foreign secretary.\n\nUpdated at 3.44pm BST\n\n\n 3.30pm  \n\nSarah Champion (Lab) goes next.\nQ: How much of the UK aid for Ukraine has gone to different agencies, local organisations and NGOs?\nJohnson says he will have to write to the committee with that information.\n\n\n\n 3.27pm  \n\nFrom the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford\n\n\n\n\n 3.25pm  \nJohnson says Nato can protect Ukraine in future by supplying enough weaponry to deter Russia\n\nJohnson says, because of the quantity of mat\u00e9riel being supplied by Nato to Ukraine, its defences capabilities are changing.\nNato will not offer Ukraine an article 5 protection. But it will offer Ukraine a different sort of protection. He goes on to say this will be\n\nbased on the idea of deterrence by denial, so that Ukraine is so fortified, so protected with weaponry, the quills of the porcupine have become so stiffened so that it is indigestible to Putin.\n\n\n\n\n 3.18pm  \n\nThe commitee is now asking about Ukraine. Tom Tugendhat starts.\nQ: Has President Macron been speaking to President Putin for too long?\nJohnson does not answer the question directly, but says he and Macron would agree that whatever happens, it is for Ukrainians to decide their future.\nQ: Do you agree with President Biden that Putin must go.\nJohnson says he understands why Biden said that. And a desire for a change of government is not ignoble, he says. He says some of the MPs in the room would like a change of government in the UK. But getting rid of Putin is not the UK\u2019s objective, he says.\n\nUpdated at 3.45pm BST\n\n\n 3.13pm  \n\nCatherine McKinnell goes next.\nQ: How would you respond to people who have signed a petition saying lying to the Commons should be a criminal offence?\nJohnson says he has tried to be \u201cas clear as I can\u201d with the Commons.\nMcKinnell says 20 fixed-penalty notices were issued yesterday.\nJohnson says he is not sure that is right.\n(Johnson may be correct. The Met just said yesterday that the process of issuing those fines was under way - not that they had actually been sent out yet.)\nQ: Didn\u2019t it look bad having a party on the anniversary of the creation of the Covid memorial wall?\nJohnson says the government did everything it could to protect people. Some things went well, and some didn\u2019t, he says.\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm BST\n\n\n 3.09pm  \n\nQ: If you did break the ministerial code, that will be a resignation matter, won\u2019t it?\nJohnson says he cannot comment now. He says he will come back and discuss these matters when the investigation is over.\nWishart says he was in rock and roll for 15 years. He could not compete with the partying at No 10.\nJohnson says that is an example of why he can\u2019t comment.\nQ: Wasn\u2019t it dreadful optics partying last night in front of the Covid bereaved?\nJohnson says that is Wishart\u2019s view. He says that is not the way he sees things. But he says it would be right to come back before the committee once this is over.\nAny such discussion is premature, he says.\n\n\n\n 3.06pm  \nJohnson refuses to discuss MP's claim at liaison committee that he'll be 'toast' if fined over Partygate\n\nClive Betts is chairing the session. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the regular committee chair, is ill with Covid.\nBetts says he will start with Partygate.\nPete Wishart (SNP) goes first.\nQ: Are you one of the 20 people who has received a fixed-penalty notice. Or are you expecting to get one?\nJohnson says: \u201cI\u2019m sure you would know if I were.\u201d\nHe says he has been to the Commons several times to explain and apologise and say how things are changing.\nBut he says he won\u2019t give \u201ca running commentary on an investigation which is under way\u201d.\nQ: We are not expecting a running commentary. If you do get fined, you are toast, aren\u2019t you?\nJohnson says:\n\nWith deepest respect to you, Pete, I don\u2019t want to minimise the importance of the issue and your point, but I just want to return to what I\u2019ve said and that is that would come under the category of a running commentary.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm BST\n\n\n 2.58pm  \nBoris Johnson questioned by Commons liaison committee\n\nBoris Johnson is about to face questions from the Commons liaison committee, which is comprised of the chairs of the Commons select committees.\nThe session will cover Ukraine and the cost of living. \nThe committee has released this list of which MPs will be asking the questions on which topics.\n\nUkraine:\nLevelling up, Housing and Communities: Clive Betts\nInternational Development: Sarah Champion\nHome Affairs: Dame Diana Johnson\nDigital, Culture, Media and Sport: Julian Knight\nForeign Affairs: Tom Tugendhat\nCost of living:\nLevelling up, Housing and Communities: Clive Betts\nEnvironmental Audit: Philip Dunne\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs: Neil Parish\nTreasury: Mel Stride\nWork and Pensions: Stephen Timms\nScottish Affairs: Pete Wishart\nParticipating with follow-up questions throughout:\nPetitions: Catherine McKinnell\nCommittee of Selection: Sir Bill Wiggin\n\n\n\n\n 2.36pm  \nShapps announces nine-point response to P&amp;O sackings, including banning vessels not paying minimum wage from British ports\n\nGrant Shapps, the transport secretary, is making a statement to MPs now setting out the government\u2019s response to the sacking of 800 workers by P&amp;O Ferries.\nThere are nine measures, he says.\nFirst, HM Revenue and Customs will get new resources to check ferry operators are complying with minimum wage law, he says.\n\nHMRC will be dedicating significant resource to check that all UK ferry operators are compliant with the national minimum wage, no ifs, no buts.\n\nSecond, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will review its enforcement policies, to ensure they are fit for purpose, he says.\nThird, employers who have not made reasonable efforts to reach agreement about redundancies will not be allowed to use fire and rehire tactics, he says. A statutory code will allow employment tribunals to take this into account, he says. He says, if employers do not consult, under the code they will be liable to a 25% increase in compensation payments.\n\nWe will take action to prevent employers who have not made reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation from using fire and rehire tactics. So new statutory code will allow a court or employment tribunal to take the manner of dismissal into account, and if an employer fails to comply with the code, impose a 25% uplift to a worker\u2019s compensation.\n\nFourth, Shapps says he has written to the Insolvency Service saying that he thinks Peter Hebblethewaite, the P&amp;O Ferries chief executive, is not fit to be a company director and asking that it consider disqualifying him.\n\nI have made no secret of my view that P&amp;O Ferries\u2019 boss Peter Hebblethwaite should resign. He set out to break the law and boasted about it to this parliament. So I\u2019ve written to the CEO of the Insolvency Service, conveying my firm belief that Peter Hebblethwaite is unfit to lead a British company. And I have asked them to consider his disqualification.\nThe Insolvency Service has the legal powers to pursue complaints where a company has engaged in, and I quote, so-called sharp practice. Surely, the whole house agrees that nothing could be sharper than dismissing 800 staff and deliberately breaking the law whilst doing so.\n\nFifth, there will be more focus on training and welfare in the maritime strategy, Shapps says. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard truth that those working at sea do not enjoy the same benefits of those working on land, which brings me to my fifth element of the package today: a renewed focus on the training and welfare elements of flagship maritime strategy.\nWe are already investing \u00a330m through the Maritime Training Fund to grow our seafarer population, but I will go further, pursuing worldwide agreements at the International Labour Organisation, where we will push for a common set of principles to support maritime workers, including an international minimum wage, a global framework for maritime training and skills.\n\nSixth, from next week the government will create new incentives for maritime firms to operate from the UK and to have their vessels registered in this country. \nSeventh, Shapps says he has opened talks with his counterparts in in France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany to discuss how maritime workers on direct routes between the UK and these countries should receive a minimum wage. He says the response has been positive, particularly from France.\n\nMuch of maritime law is governed by international laws, obligations and treaties. And this means that we cannot hope to solve the problems alone. So the seventh plank our package today is to engage with international partners.\nNow, this week, I have already contacted my counterparts in France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany to discuss how maritime workers on direct routes between our countries should receive a minimum wage. I\u2019m delighted to say the response has already been very, very positive, particularly with my French counterpart, the minister for transport. So, we will now work quickly with these counterparts to explore the creation of minimum wage corridors between our nations.\n\nBut he says the UK cannot unilaterally change minimum wage rules for seafarers. That is because maritime law is governed by international conventions, he says.\nEighth, Shapps says the government will legislate to allow ports to turn away vessels from ferry companies not paying the minimum wage. \n\nHe goes on:\n\nWe will achieve this through primary legislation to amend the Harbours Act 1964. And it means that if companies like P&amp;O Ferries want to dock in ports, such as Dover and Hull and Liverpool, they will have no choice but to comply with this legislation.\nCrucially, it means that P&amp;O Ferries can derive no benefit from the action that they have disgracefully taken.\nSo my message to P&amp;O Ferries is this. The game is up, rehire those who want to return and pay your workers all of your workers a decent wage.\n\nAnd, ninth, Shapps says that, although it will take time to pass the legislation mentioned above (point 8), he says he will be writing to ports urging them to refuse access now to companies not paying the minimum wage. He will tell them they will have the full backing of the government in doing this, he says.\n\nUpdated at 3.49pm BST\n\n\n 2.10pm  \nNo 10 refuses to admit law broken at Downing Street during Partygate\n\nAt the post-PMQs lobby briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesperson repeatedly declined to agree with Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, who said this morning the Met\u2019s decision to issue 20 fixed penalty notice means there were \u201cclearly breaches of the regulations\u201d. The spokesperson said:\n\nThe prime minister has said he respects the position of the Met, and also equally that this investigation is ongoing. You\u2019ll hear more from the prime minister at the conclusion of this process rather than in the middle.\n\nAsked several times whether the PM agreed with the justice secretary, the spokesman said: \u201cWe will not be commenting further on the detail of what happened until the investigation is completed\u201d. Pressed again, he added: \u201cIt simply would not be right for me to give the prime minister\u2019s view in the midst of an ongoing police investigation.\u201d\nLabour rejected that view, with a spokesperson for the party saying Downing Street\u2019s position was, \u201cclearly untenable, at least in the case of the 20 fixed-penalty notices that have already been issued\u201d.\nUPDATE: The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has written up a full transcript of the exchanges, which shows quite how surreal the briefing became.\n\nUpdated at 4.59pm BST\n\n\n 2.05pm  \n\nAs the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar reports, at the post-PMQs Downing Street lobby briefing No 10 was still refusing to admit that people in the building broke lockdown rules.\n\nThe PM\u2019s spokesperson told journalists:\n\nWe are maintaining our position. There is an ongoing process here. The Met have come to a conclusion and have started a process which relates to 20 fines, and we respect that.\nWe will not be commenting further on the detail of what happened until the investigation is concluded.\nIt simply would not be right for me to give the prime minister\u2019s view in the midst of an ongoing Met police investigation.\n\n\n\n\n 1.59pm  \n\nDominic Raab, the justice secretary, has told the House of Commons he plans to appeal against the Parole Board\u2019s decision that recommends Baby P\u2019s mother Tracey Connelly should be released from prison.\nRaab made the announcement as he told MPs about a \u201croot and branch\u201d review of the parole system.\n\n\n\n 1.56pm  \n\nThe Conservative MP Jamie Wallis has issued a new statement about the response to his announcement that he is transgender. Here\u2019s an extract.\n\nI am overwhelmed by the kindness and support I have received in the last few hours. I am proud to be completely open and honest about the struggles I have had, and continue to have, with my identity. However, I remain the same person I was yesterday. For the time being, I will continue to present as I always have and will use he/him/his pronouns.\n\n\n\n\n 1.44pm  \nStarmer says Johnson's claim to be tax-cutting Tory 'nonsense'\n\nHere is the PA Media story from PMQs.\n\nBoris Johnson was heckled by opposition MPs after claiming he wants to cut taxes - just days before they are hiked by the government.\nThe opposition benches erupted in fury after the prime minister made the remark as he tried to counter criticism from Keir Starmer about the government\u2019s response to the cost-of-living crisis.\nStarmer accused the prime minister of putting the Tory re-election campaign \u201cover and above\u201d helping people pay their bills.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak last week announced measures to help households, including raising the national insurance threshold to help offset the impact of April\u2019s tax hike.\nIt was previously announced that a UK-wide 1.25 percentage point increase in NI contributions will be introduced from April 6, with funds raised ring-fenced for health and social care. Sunak also reconfirmed that households will receive a rebate on their energy bills which will need to be repaid at a later date, and announced a desire for a 1p cut to the basic rate of income tax by 2024.\nStarmer said: \u201cDoes the prime minister still think that he and the chancellor are tax-cutting Conservatives?\u201d\nJohnson replied: \u201cYes, Mr Speaker, I certainly do, because this is the government that has just introduced not only the biggest cut in fuel duty ever, but the biggest cut in tax for working people in the last 10 years - 70% of the population paying national insurance contributions will have a substantial tax cut as a result of what the chancellor did.\u201d\nA Labour MP could be heard shouting: \u201cRubbish.\u201d\nJohnson replied: \u201cThey don\u2019t like it Mr Speaker. They always put up taxes.\u201d\nStarmer called on the prime minister to \u201ccut the nonsense\u201d, and said the Government is giving 1 back for every 6 taken in taxes over \u201c15 taxes rises, the highest tax burden for 70 years\u201d. He asked: \u201cPrime Minister, is that cutting taxes or is that raising taxes?\u201d\nJohnson replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know where he has been for the last two years but even by the standards of Captain Hindsight to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the \u00a3408bn we have had to spend to look after people up and down the country, is quite extraordinary.\n\u201cThis is a government that is getting on with reducing the tax burden wherever we can, what we are doing - there is one measure I think he should be supporting - and that is the health and care levy to fund our NHS.\u201d\nThe Labour leader joked: \u201cI can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.55pm BST\n\n\n 1.25pm  \nPMQs - snap verdict\n\nBoris Johnson got through that relatively easily. With the Commons recess starting tomorrow, that will be a relief, because he then enters a two-week holiday when MPs are no longer in the Commons, and so the scope for plotting/troublemaking is always reduced. Not that many of them seem minded to plot against him: judging by their enthusiasm today, his backbenchers are fully supportive.\nGiven that Johnson breezed through PMQs only 24 hours after the Met confirmed that parties were held at No 10 during lockdown that broke the law (a ruling once thought to pose an existential threat to Johnson\u2019s premiership), it has been a remarkable feat of political survival when you recall what Tory MPs were saying just a few weeks ago.\nStarmer focused on the tax burden. His analysis was spot-on, and his questions were sharp but, apart from a good joke about the PM\u2019s police questionnaire (a rehash of a gag he has used before), he never really managed to unsettle Johnson, who sounded more confident (and smug) than he has done for ages. In part that was because, when Johnson cited the pandemic as the explanation for the rising tax burden, he was deploying an argument that carries weight, and that people believe. But mostly it was because Starmer was talking in abstract terms (about the tax burden) and about process (the timing of the income tax cut). It all sounded a bit too much like something from an IFS briefing. It wasn\u2019t in any way wrong (IFS briefings rarely are); it just wasn\u2019t emotionally engaging.\nThis became evident when a series of MPs asked Johnson directly about people not being able to pay their bills. Ian Blackford framed his questions more along these lines, but the most direct came from Sarah Champion, Apsana Begum and Catherine West. They weren\u2019t especially brilliant questions, but they framed the debate in terms of prices and bills and what people have to pay. Johnson was noticeably more uncomfortable having to respond.\nStarmer also raised partygate. He effectively ridiculed the (implict) No 10 claim that Johnson only misled parliament about what was happening because he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisers, and he linked this to Johnson\u2019s evasiveness about his tax record, telling MPs:\n\n[Johnson] really does think it\u2019s one rule for him and another rule for everyone else, that he can pass off criminality in his office and ask others to follow the law. That he can keep raising taxes and call himself a tax-cutter. That he can hike tax during a cost-of-living crisis and get credit for giving a bit back just before an election. When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools?\n\nBut in the chamber this line of attack worked best when Starmer could articulate the concerns of Tory MPs, who used to sit there in silence worrying about their leader being a liar. Now, collectively, they seem to have decided to stick with Johnson, and so - with this audience, at least - the Starmer broadside bounced off much more easily.\nThe best consolation for Labour is that Johnson may have got through this all too comfortably. William Hague is credited with saying that the Conservative party has only two modes, complacency and panic, and today\u2019s PMQs gave the impression that Johnson has reverted to complacency. But the cost of living concerns raised today are huge, they matter a lot more to people outside the chamber than to the salary-cushioned MPs inside who were cheering him on, and they are only going to get worse - a lot worse.\n\nUpdated at 1.57pm BST\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nSarah Olney (Lib Dem) asks if the government will strenthen the powers of the Office for Environmental Protection, so it has the powers the European Commission had.\nJohnson says Olney wants to return to the jurisdiction of the EU.\nAnd that\u2019s it. PMQs is over.\n\n\n\n 12.42pm  \n\nSelaine Saxby (Con) asks what the government is doing about the housing shortage in north Devon.\nJohnson claims the government is building a record number of homes.\n\nUpdated at 12.43pm BST\n\n\n 12.41pm  \n\nMatt Western (Lab) also asks about the cost-of-living crunch. It must be hard for the PM to keep up with financial reality \u201cgiven that donors and friends pay for his flights and holidays\u201d. And the chancellor is so out of touch he is contactless, Western says - a reference to this.\nJohnson says Western\u2019s question would have been better as \u201ca light essay in the Guardian\u201d (high praise in our book).\n\nUpdated at 12.44pm BST\n\n\n 12.39pm  \n\nJohn Baron (Con) asks the PM to interevene to stop the closure of British Council offices.\nJohnson says he is a fan of the British Council, and it has had a massive grant, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.38pm  \n\nSir Roger Gale (Con) asks how many of the Ukrainians offered visas through the sponsorship scheme are now in the UK.\nJohnson does not answer, but he says the UK can be proud of what it is doing.\n\n\n\n 12.37pm  \n\nCatherine West (Lab) says bills and prices are going through the roof. Why didn\u2019t the government do something about this last week?\nJohnson says he understands the pressure people are under, but endlessly taxing more is not the answer.\n\n\n\n 12.35pm  \n\nJohnson welcomes the decision of supreme court judges to no longer sit on Hong Kong\u2019s highest court. (See 11.45am.)\n\n\n\n 12.35pm  \n\nApsana Begum (Lab) says the real-terms welfare cut will push more families into desperation. Does the PM agree that this has not come out of the blue, but is due to Conservative economics.\nJohnson says he does not agree. He is committed to reducing poverty, he says. He says there are 200,000 fewer kids in poverty, and 1.3m fewer people in absolute poverty, he claims.\n(But absolute poverty numbers are now forecast to rise by 1.3m.)\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nSarah Champion (Lab) says people are struggling to put food on the table or fuel in their cars. That is down to his choices, she says, not Ukraine or Covid.\nJohnson says he does not agree with the analysis. The government is taking steps to help, he says. But he says the government is not doing everything. He says people are getting into work. That would not have been possible under Labour\u2019s plans, he claims.\n\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nLucy Allan (Con) asks about the Ockenden report. Will the PM thank those who gave evidence?\nJohnson extends his sympathy to all those affected. It is important to get answers as to what went wrong, he says. Investment in maternity services is increasing, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.28pm  \n\nChris Stephens (SNP) asks why the PM is cutting a scheme to reduce food waste.\nJohnson says he thinks it is continuing, but he says he will look into what Stephens is saying.\n\n\n\n 12.27pm  \n\nJames Sutherland (Con) says most state schools in Bracknell are now graded good or outstanding. Will the PM congratulate them and back the white paper?\nJohnson says the schools white paper is fantastic.\n\n\n\n 12.26pm  \n\nGreg Smith (Con) says a proposal for a prison in his constituency was recently refused. He says his constituency is already putting up with HS2. It should not be asked to take more infrastructure, he says.\nJohnson says ministers will have heard Smith loud and clear.\n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nCarol Monaghan (SNP) asks about grid connection charges in Scotland.\nJohnson says the energy security strategy paper will propose long-term investment in the grid.\n\n\n\n 12.24pm  \n\nJohnny Mercer (Con) says the UK should double down on support for Ukraine.\nJohnson thanks Mercer for his recent visit to Ukraine. He suggests Labour would not be offering military support. He says Labour should support continuing sanctions, and sanctions should not be lifted just because of a ceasefire, he says.\n\n\n\n 12.21pm  \n\nEd Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says his grandmother took in German Jewish refugees during world war two. Now families are offering to take in Ukrainian refugees. But the paperwork is too complicated, even though rich foreigners can come to the UK visa-free.\nJohnson says everyone is pulling together. Davey should not \u201cdeprecate\u201d what the UK is offering. He says 25,000 people have got visas, 1,000 applications are being processed a day, and there is no limit to how many can come.\n\nUpdated at 12.23pm BST\n\n\n 12.19pm  \n\nMark Fletcher (Con) asks what can be done to help young people in his constituency get free travel to college.\nJohnson says he will ensure Fletcher gets a meeting with the education secretary on this.\n\n\n\n 12.18pm  \n\nIan Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says millions of families are trying to work out how they will afford the \u00a3700 energy bill hike that will hit them on Friday. But Tory MPs were gathering for a champagne bash, he says. The Tories partied during lockdown, and they are partying now, he says. The PM has been briefing against the chancellor, saying more needs to be done, he says. Blackford says he agrees. What will he tell his chancellor to do?\nJohnson says Blackford is \u201cin error\u201d about what he said last night (hinting that champagne was not drunk?). Blackford, like himself, is a testament to the virtues of \u201cmoderation in all things\u201d, he says, in a jibe at Blackford\u2019s waistline.\nBlackford says the Tories do not understand that over the next week the weather in Scotland will barely reach above freezing. Will they turn the \u00a3200 heating loan into a grant?\nJohnson says Blackford is right to draw attention to the problem. It is \u201cpreposterous\u201d that the SNP is opposed to the use of native hydrocarbons, he claims.\n\nUpdated at 12.24pm BST\n\n\n 12.13pm  \n\nStarmer says either Johnson is trashing the ministerial code, or he was repeatedly lied to by own advisers. He really does think it is one rule for him and another for everyone else. When will he stop taking the public for fools?\nJohnson repeats his claim that Labour would have kept the country in lockdown. Unemployment has fallen to below the levels it was at the start of the pandemic. He says Labour want to keep people on benefits, while the government wants them in work. He says the UK has more unicorns ($1bn start-ups) than France, Germany and Israel combined.\n\nUpdated at 12.15pm BST\n\n\n 12.10pm  \n\nStarmer says the Tories are the party of excess oil and gas profits. Labour is the party of working people. Talking of parties, Johnson told MPs that no rules were broken during lockdown. Now the police say the laws were broken. The ministerial code says ministers who knowingly mislead the house should resign. Why is he still here?\nJohnson says only recently Starmer was saying Johnson should not resign. (That is not quite correct - Starmer said he was no longer arguing for that, in the light of the Ukraine war.) \n\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\n\u201cTough decisions - give me a break,\u201d says Starmer. He says a windfall tax would raise billions, and ease the burden on working people. The head of BP says they have more cash than they know what to do with, he says.\nJohnson says energy companies need to invest. And the 1997 Labour manifesto said there was no economic case for nuclear power. He says the government is now having to reverse that.\n\n\n\n 12.06pm  \n\nStarmer says he hopes the PM\u2019s police questionnaire was more convincing. The Tories have put up taxes, but are planning a small cut for election year. How did the PM find a chancellor this cynical?\nJohnson says the chancellor has protected people. And if they had listened to Captain Hindsight, they would not have come out of lockdown last summer, and they would have been in lockdown over Christmas. The government would have had to tax and borrow more.\n\n\n\n 12.05pm  \n\nStarmer says the tax burden is the highest for 70 years. For every \u00a36 they are raising in tax, they are only giving \u00a31 back.\nJohnson says he does not know where Starmer has been for the last two years. To ignore the biggest pandemic for a century is extraordinary. And Labour do not back the health and social care levy.\n\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nKeir Starmer asks if Johnson still thinks he and the chancellor are tax-cutting Conservatives.\nJohnson says he does. They have introduced the biggest ever fuel duty cut, and the biggest cut to personal taxes for 25 years.\n\nUpdated at 12.13pm BST\n\n\n 12.02pm  \n\nGareth Davies (Con) asks what role the Joint Expeditionary Force can play in the Baltics.\nJohnson says the JEF is playing an increasingly important role in countering Russian aggression.\n\n\n\n 12.01pm  \n\nBoris Johnson starts by saying MPs will have read the statement from Jamie Wallis, and he says the whole house will offer their support.\n\n\n\n 11.58am  \n\nAfter PMQs there are three ministerial statements: on the Ockenden report, on public protection (sentencing) and on P&amp;O.\n\n\n\n 11.55am  \nPMQs\n\nPMQs is about to start. It will be the last one before Easter.\nHere is the list of MPs down to ask a question.\n\n\n\n\n 11.45am  \nBritain cuts legal links with Hong Kong's top court to avoid risk of 'legitimising oppression'\n\nBritain\u2019s two most senior judges have quit their longstanding role as members of Hong Kong\u2019s court of final appeal.\nIn a statement issued this morning Lord Reed, president of the supreme court, and his deputy, Lord Hodge, said it was no longer tenable for them to carry on sitting on the Hong Kong court, under an arrangement that dates from 1997, when Hong Kong was returned to China under the terms of the joint declaration that was intended to protect some of Hong Kong\u2019s institutions.\nThe move has been agreed with the Foreign Office, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said she wholeheartedly backed the judges\u2019s decision.\nIn a statement Reed said the introduction of the Hong Kong national security law two years ago had changed the situation. He said:\n\nThe courts in Hong Kong continue to be internationally respected for their commitment to the rule of law. Nevertheless, I have concluded, in agreement with the government, that the judges of the supreme court cannot continue to sit in Hong Kong without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression, to which the justices of the supreme court are deeply committed.\nLord Hodge and I have accordingly submitted our resignations as non-permanent judges of the HKCFA with immediate effect.\n\nAnd in her statement Truss said:\n\nWe have seen a systematic erosion of liberty and democracy in Hong Kong. Since the national security law was imposed, authorities have cracked down on free speech, the free press and free association.\nThe situation has reached a tipping point where it is no longer tenable for British judges to sit on Hong Kong\u2019s leading court, and would risk legitimising oppression.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.58am BST\n\n\n 11.27am  \n\nIn the committee Lord Harrington, the minister for refugees, says that if a sponsorship arrangements falls down, and people can no longer host Ukrainian refugees, the government will try to find them another sponsor. If that is not possible, homing them will be the responsibility of the local authority, he says.\n\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\nEarlier the Local Government Association told the Commons levelling up committee that some Ukrainian refugees have been \u201cpresenting as homeless\u201d. James Jamieson, chair of the LGA, told the committee:\n\nOne of the big issues we\u2019re all worried about is people presenting as homeless.\nThe LGA did a survey last week of councils - we had 190 responses from councils with housing responsibilities, which is around two-thirds of authorities, of which 57 of the 190 said they already had people presenting as homeless.\nThat is 144 cases of homelessness - that\u2019s 57 councils, 144 cases ... Forty-four of which were from the family scheme, 36 of which were from the sponsorship scheme and 64 were from unknown or other.\nWe believe there is an element of people presenting as homeless because they are coming to Ireland and then, with the free movement, able to come to the UK, so that maybe an element of the unknown.\n\n\n\n\n 11.20am  \nSurvey shows NHS staff have become less confident in quality of care offered by their organisation\n\nA diminishing number of NHS staff are happy with the standard of care provided by their organisation, PA Media reports. Covering the results of a major new survey, PA says:\n\nThe questionnaire, filled out by almost 650,000 NHS workers in England, found that 67.8% were happy with the standard of care in 2021, down from three-quarters (74.2%) in 2020.\nOnly 59.4% would recommend their organisation as a place to work.\nAnd 72% said their organisation acts on concerns raised by patients - down from 75% in 2020.\nMeanwhile, fewer staff said that care of patients is their organisation\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d - 75.6% in 2021 compared with 79.5% in 2020.\nAnd less than a third of NHS staff are happy with the amount of money they are paid, the survey shows.\nJust 32.7% of health service workers said they are satisfied with their level of pay, a decline of four percentage points from the 2020 NHS staff survey.\nMeanwhile an increasing proportion of NHS staff said they feel discriminated against at work.\nThe new survey, which represents the views of health staff in England in 2021, found that 9.1% reported being discriminated against by managers or colleagues in the last 12 months - up from 7.7% in 2019 and 8.4% in 2020.\nThis rose to 17% among black, Asian and ethnic minority staff - up from 14.5% in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n 11.13am  \n\nHere is my colleague Amelia Gentleman\u2019s story on the new figures saying just 2,700 visas have been issued under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\n\n\n\n\n 11.10am  \n\nBoris Johnson has posted a message on Twitter praising Jamie Wallis, the Conservative MP who has come out as transgender.\n\n\n\n\n 10.54am  \n\nBetts asks Harrington how many people have actually arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Harrington says it is too early to say, but he says he may be able to tell the committee at the end of the week.\n\n\n\n 10.47am  \n\nHarrington said that he agreed it took too long to fill in a visa application form. He said at the weekend he spent just under under an hour filling out one out himself, and he was in a more comfortable situation than the refugees who have to fill them out. He said the government was looking at what it can do to make the forms shorter.\n\nUpdated at 10.52am BST\n\n\n 10.44am  \n2,700 visas have been issued under Homes for Ukraine scheme, MPs told\n\nHarrington said that just under 60,000 visa applications had been received under the two special scheme available for Ukrainians.\nUnder the family scheme, there had been 31,200 applications, and 22,800 visas had been issued, he said.\nAnd under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, there had been 28,300 application. As of last night, 2,700 visas had been issued, he said.\nHarrington said he was hopeful that, under both schemes, the government would end up getting 15,000 visa applications per week. That might be possible next week, or the week after, he said. And he said he hoped the backlog would be quickly cleared.\n\nUpdated at 10.52am BST\n\n\n 10.37am  \nRefugees minister Lord Harrington questioned by MPs about support for Ukrainians\n\nAt the Commons levelling up committee Lord Harrington, the new minister for refugees, is giving evidence about the Homes for Refugees programme.\nClive Betts (Lab) starts by reminding Harrington he has just been in the post for two weeks.\nHarrington starts by saying this dealing with refugees is a cross-government initiative.\n\n\n\n 10.32am  \n\nThere have been 28,300 visa applications received under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, and 31,200 under the Ukraine family scheme as of 29 March, PA Media reports. The Home Office gave the total number of visas issued as 25,500 - including 2,700 under the sponsorship scheme and 22,800 under the family scheme.\n\n\n\n 10.20am  \n\nAnd here are some tweets from opposition politicians expressing support for Jamie Wallis.\nFrom Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary\n\nFrom Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle\n\nFrom the Lib Dems\u2019 Layla Moran\n\nFrom Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster\n\nFrom the Lib Dems\u2019 Alistair Carmichael\n\nFrom the Labour peer Michael Cashman\n\n\n\n\n 10.13am  \nHow Johnson joked about trans rights hours before Tory MP declared: 'I'm trans'\n\nHours before the Conservative MP Jamie Wallis declared as trans (see 9.23am), Boris Johnson was reportedly making a joke about trans issues at a dinner for his MPs. According to the Independent, Johnson said:\n\nGood evening ladies and gentleman, or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth.\n\nHowever, this morning Wallis\u2019s colleagues have been more supportive. Here are some of the tweets from Conservative MPs.\nFrom Oliver Dowden, the Tory co-chair\n\nFrom Tom Tugendhat\n\nFrom Alicia Kearns\n\nFrom Michael Fabricant\n\n\nUpdated at 10.49am BST\n\n\n 9.50am  \nRaab admits that some of Johnson's statements in parliament about Partygate weren't true\n\nAnd here are some more lines from what Dominic Raab said in his interviews this morning on \u201cpartygate\u201d.\n\nRaab said Boris Johnson has said things in parliament about the parties at No 10 that were untrue. On the Today programme Mishal Husain asked Raab, the deputy PM, if he accepted that Johnson had said things in parliament about this that were not true. Raab replied: \u201cYes\u201d, but stressed that Johnson was giving his understanding of events, \u201cto the best of his ability\u201d. Raab also said that events took place in Downing Street that broke the rules. These statements might seem obvious, but at the Downing Street lobby briefing yesterday the PM\u2019s spokesperson was not willing to be this direct.\n\n\nBut Raab insisted that Johnson was not intentionally misleading MPs when answering questions about partygate. (See 9am.) He said:\n\n\nI think it is rather different to say that he lied, which suggests that he was deliberately misleading. The PM has not to date been issued with a fixed-penalty notice.\nClearly we had the investigations because of the claims, the assertions that were made, which it was right to follow up, and it is clear there were breaches of the law.\nBut to jump from that to say the prime minister deliberately misled parliament rather than answering to the best of his ability is just not right.\n\n\nRaab would not say whether Johnson would correct the record, and acknowledge that he had misled MPs with his statements on this in the past. Asked about this, Raab said he did now know what Johnson would say at PMQs later. (Johnson almost never corrects the record when he is shown to have made misleading comments in the Commons. The only recent example of his doing so came after he said Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch, had been subject to sanctions. Johnson issued a written statement saying this was wrong - although Abramovich was subsequently put on the sanctions list, which means Johnson was only wrong in terms of timing. There was no such correction after Johnson implied Keir Starmer was responsible for the CPS not prosecuting Jimmy Savile, a suggestion that was wholly untrue.)\n\n\nHe defended the No 10 plan not to reveal whether or not Carrie Johnson, the PM\u2019s wife, received a fine for breaking lockdown rules. He said the public should know if rule-makers had broken the rules, but she wasn\u2019t a rule-maker. When it was put to him that the public should know if there had been a breach of rules in the PM\u2019s own home (ie, the Downing Street flat), Raab just restated his point about Carrie not being a politician.\n\n\nHe refused to say whether he thought Johnson would have to resign if he was fined for a lockdown breach. \u201cI am not going to comment on hypothetical questions or speculate on an ongoing police investigation,\u201d he said.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.06am BST\n\n\n 9.23am  \nConservative MP Jamie Wallis declares: 'I'm trans'\n\nThe Conservative MP Jamie Wallis, who represents Bridgend in south Wales, has issued a statement saying: \u201cI\u2019m trans ... or want to be.\u201d Wallis has gender dysphoria. \n\nIn a moving account, the backbencher says originally disclosure was not planned, but traumatic events prompted a rethink. Here is an extract.\n\nI\u2019m trans. Or to be more accurate, I want to be. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and I\u2019ve felt this way since I was a very young child. I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud.\n\nFellow MPs are already using Twitter to express their support - although, judging by the early response, opposition MPs have been more vocal in praising Wallis\u2019s bravery than Tory ones. \nNormally a declaration like this from an MP has no wider political consequences, but this one might. Some Tories believe that trans rights, or, more accurately, a gender-critical take on trans rights, is a \u201cculture war\u201d issue that will harm Labour, and Boris Johnson seemed to be channelling this at PMQs last week when spoke about people who transition and provocatively said: \u201cWhen it comes to distinguishing between a man and a woman, the basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important.\u201d Statements like this explain why Labour MPs have spent the week being asked whether a woman can have a penis. \nNow that the first trans MP turns out to be a Conservative, perhaps Johnson and his colleagues will show more restraint.\n\nUpdated at 10.08am BST\n\n\n 9.00am  \nBoris Johnson told MPs truth about parties \u2018to the best of his ability\u2019, says Raab\n\nGood morning. Boris Johnson has PMQs today for the last time before the Easter recess and, amid questions about Ukraine and the cost of living, he is bound to be asked why he repeatedly told MPs the Covid rules were always followed in Downing Street when the police have now ruled that the law was broken. The opposition has accused Johnson of lying, and by and large the public agrees. Yesterday Downing Street refused to accept that Johnson had lied to parliament - but the PM\u2019s spokesperson also refused to say that Johnson now accepts that the law was broken, suggesting that the denial strategy is still operative at No 10.\nDominic Raab, the deputy PM and justice secretary, has been giving interviews this morning, and he claimed that Johnson was telling the truth to parliament \u201cto the best of his ability\u201d. He told Sky News:\n\nI don\u2019t know the full facts of the fixed penalty notices, but the prime minister was telling the House of Commons and the public what he knew to the best of his ability.\n\n\nAnd on Times Radio Raab adopted a similar line. Asked if Johnson has misled parliament, he replied:\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think there was an intention to mislead. The prime minister in good faith updated parliament on what he knows.\n\nI will post more from the Raab interviews soon.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n9.30am: Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, gives evidence to the Commons science committee.\n10.30am: Lord Harrington, the new minister for refugees, gives evidence to the Commons levelling up committee about the homes for Ukrainians scheme. The Local Government Association is also giving evidence, from 10am.\n12pm: Boris Johnson faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.\nAfter 12.45pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to the health and social care bill.\n1.15pm: Dame Kate Bingham, the former head of the government\u2019s vaccines taskforce, and Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford vaccine group, speak at the Royal Society\u2019s conference on Covid. At 4.45pm Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, speaks.\n2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, makes a statement in the Scottish parliament about Covid.\n3pm: Johnson takes questions from the Commons liaison committee.\nI try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.\nIf you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow.\nAlternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com.\n\nUpdated at 10.09am BST\n"

Starbucks charges its US customers roughly 70\u00a2 extra for oat, soy, almond, and coconut milk, and such additional costs are common at other cafes across the country. But not every coffee shop does the same. And the reasons they cite are not only customer taste preferences \u2013 they say that dairy milk is far worse for the climate, and that because rates of lactose intolerance are higher among people of color, the alternative milk surcharge also perpetuates unfairness. There are calls for more coffee shops, and Starbucks, to follow suit. Last month, Starbucks dropped the upcharge for non-dairy milk in all of its 1,020 stores in the UK, prompting the question: why does the surcharge exist in the first place? For years, pressure has been mounting on Starbucks to remove the fees, with the latest campaign by dairy-free advocacy group Switch4Good criticizing the corporation in a mock press release. It followed with an open letter to Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson printed as a half-page ad in the Seattle Times, which highlighted what it called the dietary racism of the dairy alternative surcharge. About 36% of people in the US are lactose intolerant, a genetic condition that predominantly affects people of color. Yet the odds are stacked for dairy. The US Department of Agriculture subsidizes the dairy industry, and offers federal reimbursements for cow\u2019s milk served to over 50 million students in school lunches. \u201cThe USDA mandates cow\u2019s milk in schools, and it is the most common food allergy in children under 16,\u201d said Dotsie Bausch, an Olympic cyclist and executive director of Switch4Good. \u201cI have to ask myself, would it ever be acceptable to offer a food staple to Caucasian kids that is not digestible to them?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to charge more for plant-based milk,\u201d said Ebony Williams-Cox, a vegan content creator based in Reading, whose beverage of choice is hot chocolate with soy milk and dairy-free cream. \u201cI\u2019m a Starbucks girl, but it\u2019s not accessible to everyone. Those barriers in place are what stops people from even trying vegan milks.\u201d A Starbucks spokesperson told the Guardian that in US stores, adding a \u201csplash\u201d of any non-dairy to beverages like brewed coffee is free of charge, while custom drinks and adding more than a splash come with costs similar \u201cto other beverage customizations such as an additional espresso shot or syrup\u201d. The spokesperson did not say why plant-based alternatives cost more, telling the Guardian that the company has \u201cnothing immediate to share on plans in the US to remove the additional cost\u201d. The retail price of plant-based milk is roughly twice that of dairy milk, according to Mintec, which analyzes food commodity price data. The higher price is attributed to packaging, plus a more costly blending and bottling process. But has dairy milk\u2019s ascendance peaked? In the US, cow\u2019s milk consumption has been declining at an average rate of 2.6% a year in the past decade, while plant-based milk alternatives have been on a rise. Adapting to changing consumer patterns, many dairy producers have shifted to producing non-dairy milk, with some, such as Elmhurst, switching entirely to a plant-based production.  Blue Bottle Coffee, a leading chain, has made oat milk the default at 27 \u2013 or more than a third \u2013 of its US locations. \u201cWe estimate dairy to be a leading source of emissions from our cafe operations,\u201d Audrey Waldrop, sustainability manager at Blue Bottle Coffee, said in a statement to the Guardian. The carbon footprint of cow\u2019s milk is about three times that of plant-based milk. \u201cIn offering oat milk as the default milk choice, we wanted to provide a sustainable alternative without the extra charge, in addition to realizing that some folks are intolerant to dairy.\u201d Although plant-based milk has lower greenhouse gas emissions than cow\u2019s milk,\u200b\u200b farmed alternatives also have their drawbacks, too. Almond milk, for example, uses more water than any other dairy alternative, while the growing demand for soy, which is mainly used for animal feed rather than milk, is driving deforestation in the Amazon. \u201cIn the long term, the prices for plant-based milk might go down as the size of the industry increases, allowing for more competition in the market,\u201d said Binod Khanal, who researches agricultural economics and consumer behavior at the University of Connecticut. He said the preference for plant-based milk among consumers is largely due to concerns for climate change as well as lactose intolerance, predominantly among the non-white demographic. Roughly 61% of US households are primarily dairy milk drinkers, while close to 23% were primarily plant based drinkers \u2013 and were more likely to identify as liberal \u2013 according to a recent study. But while the milk consumption has declined, overall dairy consumption in the US keeps going up, thanks to milk-derived products like cheese, butter, yogurt and kefir. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the biggest shift in cheese, which tripled in the last five decades,\u201d said Alan Bjerga, a spokesperson for the National Milk Producers Federation. He acknowledged that the dairy industry has been competing with plant-based beverages for the past 40 years, while challenging their right to even use terms like \u201cmilk\u201d to describe their products. \u201cIf coffee houses are charging more for a plant-based beverage, that\u2019s probably because it costs more to begin with, and they need to keep their margin,\u201d Bjerga said. Following the announcement of Starbucks UK dropping its surcharge, plant-based consumers like Ebony Williams-Cox are hopeful that other companies will follow suit. \u201cBetter late than never,\u201d Williams-Cox said. \u201cPlant-based products still cost more, which is why a lot of people perceive it as an expensive lifestyle, but it\u2019s not the consumers that price things up.\u201d"
