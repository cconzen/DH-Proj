Other buildings seem to twist or lean or incorporate shapes such as flying saucers. You\u2019ll see echoes of global landmarks too: a skyscraper with something of the Shard about it, a doppelg\u00e4nger of the Empire State Building \u2014 flashes of familiarity that add to the surreal quality of the skyline, as though it were conjured in a dream. Take a boat on Doha Bay at sunset and the dream becomes mesmeric. Along the shore, streets are strung with orange lights. Red bulbs pulse on top of towers like the lamps of urban lighthouses. More lights appear with every darkening minute, running in comic-book colours down the edges of the skyscrapers or painting their Yet it\u2019s not timeless, of course; quite the contrary. \u201cStrange to think that none of this was here 30 years ago,\u201d my guide, Alessandra Sabdi, says as we look over the West Bay area of the city. She hands me a photo of this stretch of coast, taken in 1980: all it shows is desert. Qatar\u2019s transition from a country of Bedouin traders and pearl divers has been breathless. Now it\u2019s trying to shift once more, from an economy of gas and oil to a Middle Eastern hub of tourism and international events. Formula One was in town last November as Doha hosted its first Grand Prix, while later this year \u2014 as if you weren\u2019t aware \u2014 Qatar will stage the Fifa World Cup. With such high-profile events comes scrutiny that glares brighter than any West Bay tower. \u201cQatar is under the global spotlight now,\u201d Sabdi says when I meet her the next day in the historic quarter of Msheireb. Like everyone else I ask, Sabdi \u2014 who moved here from Ecuador three years ago and works as a city guide \u2014 is well aware of negative media reports about the treatment of immigrant labourers paving the way for the World Cup. \u201cBut there\u2019s been a real push to improve things. People aren\u2019t allowed to work during the hottest hours any more, and a minimum wage has been introduced. Some employers are still abusing the system, I\u2019m sure, but things are so much better than before. And you have to remember the context, just how far Qatar has come in a short time.\u201d Context is everywhere in Bin Jelmood House, one of four historic buildings renovated in 2011 to showcase the country\u2019s past \u2014 and not just the good stuff. This was once the home of a slave trader. \u201cFor centuries, Doha was a centre of the trade,\u201d Sabdi explains. \u201cBedouins would traffic people from Africa and Asia, often bringing whole families.\u201d Women were set to work as cleaners while men risked their lives as pearl divers, submerged in the sea for minutes at a time collecting oysters. Today, the whitewashed rooms where slaves were kept contain displays that lift the veil on the shameful trade. In film footage from the 1940s, bare-chested Sudanese men in the central courtyard of the house stare blankly at the camera. A photo from 2003 shows children in jockeys\u2019 colours mounted on camels. \u201cSlavery was abolished in 1952, but less than two decades ago four-year-old kids were being trafficked to ride in camel races,\u201d Sabdi says, shaking her head. \u201cCamels run at 60km/h. Can you imagine how dangerous that was?\u201d In 2005 Sheikha Moza, the mother of the present emir of Qatar, demanded that the practice should cease, so lightweight \u201crobo jockeys\u201d were introduced. In the aftermath, Bin Jelmood House was used as a shelter for the children, and their families were offered legal support, training and healthcare. \u201cChange came because international visitors started seeing what was going on and putting it out on social media,\u201d Sabdi says. \u201cThey shone a light. Now this house is being used to fight global slavery.\u201d The implication is clear: tourism and the global gaze can make Qatar a better place. Beneath the shiny skyscrapers snakes a rich thread of culture and tradition for visitors who want to follow it. Evening is falling and the call to prayer wavers in the air as Alessandra and I walk to nearby Souq Waqif. The alleys and squares are filled with activity and the sweet scent of shisha tobacco, just as they would have been a century ago. Stalls sell everything from flatbreads to powder for henna tattoos, and a trader sings to draw the crowds to his table of bronze camels. Alessandra leads me past shops offering incense, perfumes, rugs, baskets, knives and holster belts. We watch a sweet-maker stir boiling sugar in a copper cauldron, and look through the window of a shop owned by the last surviving pearl diver. Elsewhere, a glassblower is so keen to demonstrate the strength of his wares that he whacks a series of baubles on his work bench until I buy one. Most memorable of all are the falcon shops. Birds perch quietly in rows, perhaps 40 or 50 at a time, some with hoods and others quietly watching. Falconry is an ancient sport in this region, and the best-trained birds can cost up to \u00a335,000. Indeed, they are so cherished that Qatar Airways permits them to travel in the cabin. \u201cThe owner must buy the falcon a separate ticket, of course,\u201d Alessandra says. The next morning I peel myself from my bed at 3.30am to join my desert guide, Habib, in his 4x4. Immaculate in his   and   \u2014 the traditional Qatari robe and headdress \u2014 he drives south along the quiet highway. After an hour the tarmac runs out and he stops to let air out of his chunky tyres \u2014 they must be soft to tackle the sand. Then we\u2019re bumping into the desert. Sand hisses beneath the chassis and my stomach lurches as Habib accelerates sharply up a bank and down the other side. An excursion of a more leisurely nature in the dunes is a rite of passage for Qataris, a chance to reconnect with a way of life before oil was discovered. In the distance, clusters of lights twinkle in the dark where families have come together in camps, burning the age-old Bedouin flame of hospitality, albeit in modern caravans rather than camel-hair tents. We stop at the top of a lonely dune with the steepest of drops below and Habib spreads a cloth for a dawn breakfast. As a cool breeze ruffles the sand, the horizon blooms lemon and blue. The sun emerges as a dot from the haze, barely discernible at first, then flaring into the deepest of pinks. The morning heats in minutes. The colours are extraordinary, just as they are 30 minutes later when we visit the nearby inland sea with the sun playing on the surface; just as they were when night fell over the skyscrapers around Doha Bay. Yes, Qatar is a country of lights and, as the world watches, this is its chance to shine. One of the world\u2019s leading collections of Islamic art, with exhibits dating from the 7th century, MIA is closed for renovation, but will reopen in the autumn in time for the World Cup. It\u2019s still worth a stop for its architecture; the IM Pei-designed building is set over five floors on a specially constructed peninsula at the southern end of Doha Bay. From the water it has the look of a ship with a central funnel, but the shape was also influenced by the Ibn Tulun Mosque in Cairo and includes elegant arches, water features and a crescent-shaped park (\u00a311;  ). This museum, made up of interlocking discs in the shape of a desert rose crystal cluster, opened in 2019. Inside, Qatar\u2019s story is told through imaginative video installations (including cinematic re-enactments of historic events) and a range of exhibits, from Bedouin tents to handwritten letters confirming the discovery of oil in 1939. Look out for the 1865 Pearl Carpet of Baroda, made from more than a million pearls, sold a few years ago for just over \u00a34 million, and described as \u201cone of the most remarkable objects ever created\u201d (\u00a310;  ). In addition to Bin Jelmood House, the Msheireb quarter contains three more restored historic residences. Built in the 1920s, Radwani House is one of the oldest homes in Doha, and allows visitors a taste of traditional Qatari life. Mohammed Bin Jassim House was the city pad of the son of the founder of modern Qatar, and charts the development of Msheireb from the construction of its narrow   (alleyways) to the introduction of electricity. Finally, Company House was the headquarters of the Brits who ran Qatar\u2019s first oil company and has displays of original drilling machinery and photos of the workers (free;  )."},

Whatever; whether the laws in the country you want to visit are \u201cdormant\u201d or acted upon, it\u2019s sensible to know your rights \u2014 and wrongs \u2014 well before you book that innocuous-sounding break (start with  ). \u201cThere have been cases of men getting arrested after having sex on a cruise in a country where being gay is illegal,\u201d says Dan Leveille, creator of  , a collaborative LGBTQ+ rights knowledge base. \u201cEvents, clubs and spas are also sometimes raided. In the most homophobic countries police have been reported to use Grindr and social media to weed out people.\u201d Visitors aren\u2019t exempt. So should you stay away if you\u2019re gay? It\u2019s not easy to get a straight answer. \u201cOn paper yes, in reality no,\u201d says Hugh Eddon-Carruthers, who, with his husband, Ben, runs the LGBT-centric tour operator  . \u201cIn the case of Dubai, the Maldives and many other countries that rely heavily on tourism, they often turn a blind eye to tourists\u2019 practices. Take the consumption of alcohol \u2014 in both the Maldives and Dubai it is illegal to buy and consume, but in licensed hotels for tourists it is fine.\u201d Note the phrase \u201cturn a blind eye\u201d \u2014 not exactly the same thing as a human right enshrined in law. Personally I confess to being routinely on edge when I travel, alone or as a couple, even if it\u2019s just a case of a stranger ingenuously \u201cdeducing\u201d me. As women and people of colour find, aggressions can be micro (\u201cWhy is your husband not on holiday with you?\u201d), even well meaning (\u201cYour braids are gorgeous \u2014 so exotic!\u201d). I remember a trip to Wales with my civil partner, Ashley. The only gays in the B&B \u2014 actually, the only guests \u2014 we were asked perplexingly if we\u2019d like romantic music with our cornflakes. (Yes, of   we requested Barbra Streisand.) Elsewhere we\u2019ve been unnerved, although the intent might have been benign. Take our taxi driver, 15 years ago, in Egypt, where the charge of \u201cdebauchery\u201d has been used to prosecute LGBT people. En route ostensibly to the pyramids, we were whisked to a dilapidated neighbourhood where he peddled camel tours. \u201cYou are brothers?\u201d he enquired. It might have been sales patter or something more sinister. Whatever, I stared him down boldly and squeaked \u201cYes\u201d. On another occasion we were arriving in St Lucia, where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) states certain homosexual acts are illegal. Out of nowhere the immigration officer asked us what our relationship was. This time I couldn\u2019t lie. In the event absolutely nothing came of it. She probably just couldn\u2019t understand what a nice boy like Ashley was doing with me. Still, paranoia persists. \u201cWe would always advise caution when travelling through international airports,\u201d says Jaike Rowe, concierge manager at the LGBT-focused tour operator  . \u201cIf you\u2019re travelling somewhere particularly challenging, consider going through immigration separately. It\u2019s disappointing that we\u2019re giving this advice in 2022, but it\u2019s the reality of travelling as an LGBT+ person or couple.\u201d I asked two lesbian friends for their thoughts. \u201cYou don\u2019t receive the same attention as two males would, but it can be an inferior experience \u2014 you may get fobbed off with the crummiest room,\u201d one said. \u201cAnd female couples can still be regarded as \u2018fair game\u2019 for any would-be lotharios too.\u201d Then there\u2019s relationship status. Another couple, Caroline and her wife, were invited to a friend\u2019s surprise 40th birthday party in Dubai. \u201cWe had to point out homosexuality is illegal across the UAE,\u201d she said. \u201cOur passports clearly detail our names and each other as next of kin and we\u2019d be giving this information to passport control. We didn\u2019t want to take the risk of imprisonment or worse\u201d How can a tour operator ensure the safety of its clients at the destination? It depends on the company. Out of Office sells a lot of holidays to the Maldives. \u201cThe destination is under sharia law and it\u2019s technically illegal to be LGBT+,\u201d Rowe says. \u201cBut we visit and work with resorts that are totally welcoming to our community. You\u2019ll receive the same honeymoon amenities any straight couple would. We\u2019ve even been able to facilitate same-sex symbolic weddings.\u201d So far, so five star. What about, say, backpackers? Anyone LGBT and determined to visit a destination has little alternative other than to do their homework, know the risks locally and be on their best behaviour. Which, to be fair, isn\u2019t too much to ask of someone in public. Hand on heart, regardless of gender, I can\u2019t abide the sight of couples French kissing on the 22 to Oxford Circus. I just would like a double bed on holiday. How can repressive laws be revoked? In the Commonwealth, in particular, it\u2019s an issue tainted with the spectre of colonialism, but Daley believes not staging sporting events in countries that criminalise same-sex sexuality would send a strong message. (This year\u2019s football World Cup, for instance, takes place in Qatar, where, the FCDO states, \u201csex outside of marriage, regardless of whether this is same-sex couples or opposite-sex couples, is illegal\u201d and can lead to a custodial sentence.) On a more positive note, it may simply come from within. In Africa countries including Botswana, Angola, Gabon and Mozambique have decriminalised same-sex relations. Homophobic attitudes and acts of aggression will be harder to change. In Jamaica, says Luke Korzun Martin, the director of Daley\u2019s documentary, social justice groups such as J-Flag (the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays) are working to ensure the country is an open, safe place for everyone, regardless of sexuality. \u201cThere have actually been Pride marches in Jamaica since 2015,\u201d he tells me, \u201cand we met some openly gay Jamaicans who now feel comfortable hanging out together in public.\u201d Maybe my partner and I will holiday over rum punches in Montego Bay one day; I hear people are really welcoming there. But for now I\u2019m simply too worried about that scary \u201claw against me\u201d. For the time being we can always stick with South Wales \u2014 just no Barbra Streisand at breakfast, please."},

And it will be showtime soon enough. But not quite yet. Opening a luxury hotel is difficult at the best of times. But opening a luxury hotel in Qatar, where incomprehensible rules and impenetrable bureaucracy hold tyrannical sway, during the unprecedented maelstrom of a World Cup? Well, ambitious doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. So there were a few teething problems when I arrived at the new jewel in Nick Jones\u2019s Soho House-and-beyond crown. In fact, the hotel had no record of my pre-arranged stay. Then the Qatari authorities, in all their wisdom, decided to close the roads around the hotel for the tournament. Upon arrival I spent an uncomfortable 40 minutes standing by a The unfailingly polite night managers weren\u2019t expecting me, but eventually I showed them some suitably official emails and they found me a room. The building has been converted from the old Ministry of the Interior and the bedrooms and hallways aim to \u201cnod to 1970s glamour\u201d, or what you might also call \u201cGaddafi chic\u201d: salmon-pink marble and mint-green carpets, dark wooden finishes, leopard-print lampshades, a large headboard shaped like an oyster shell. The aesthetic made me want to put on a pair of dark aviators and host a bunga bunga party. Still, this is \u2014 or at least soon will be \u2014 a seriously impressive endeavour. The Ned, currently represented in London and New York, is an offshoot of Soho House for rich people. Or even richer people. The focus is less on being a home for artsy creatives, more on being extremely plush. The original outpost in the City of London, named after the Edward Lutyens building it occupies, is already a bankers\u2019 favourite. If the Ned\u2019s goal is to lure in big spenders, then the Doha waterfront is a logical choice: palatial, resplendent and a bit unsettling. This town is a magnet for oil, gas, sport, politics and hard cash from across the Gulf. The rooms start at an introductory rate of \u00a3250 a night. Membership of Ned\u2019s Club, which entitles you to flit between different Neds and access all areas, is a rather more hefty $7,500 per year with a $1,000 joining fee. The five-storey building sits in splendid isolation right in the middle of Doha\u2019s Corniche waterfront, overlooking the Persian Gulf and the futuristic skyscrapers of West Bay. The squat, imposing edifice is one of the oldest in Doha, where almost nothing predates the 1960s. It has 90 bedrooms, seven restaurants, a gorgeous outdoor pool and all the Cowshed toiletries you could hope to slather yourself with. During my stay Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar himself, or what\u2019s known in Doha as a \u201cVVIP\u201d, came to give the project his blessing. He sat up in the Ned\u2019s Club rooftop bar for a couple of hours, which is a big deal in these parts \u2014 normally he\u2019d just drop in for ten minutes. In due course this place will fly. It is far more stylish than the generic and hulking luxury hotels that populate much of the Doha waterfront: Intercontinental, St Regis, Waldorf. While I was there groups of well-heeled Qataris were already coming in to find refuge from the mania of the World Cup, chattering over mint tea or taking pictures of the burrata and cacio e pepe at Cecconi\u2019s, the staple Soho House Italian. Much is familiar here, but what makes this spot unlike any other Ned or Soho House I\u2019ve visited is the locals. Each afternoon the hushed marble of the atrium is populated by princely young men in thobes discussing football and military service over Arabic coffee. Elsewhere, and very separately, chic young women in abayas indulge in the beloved Gulf pastime of brunch. \u201cI like how small this place is \u2014 it\u2019s cute,\u201d one of them told me. Apparently 500,000 sq ft is compact in Qatar. There were a few more hiccups. On my second night the air conditioning in my room had a nervous breakdown and started to impersonate a bear dying of emphysema. My real mistake, though, was getting too impatient about the road closures and deciding to brave the desert swelter instead of waiting for a golf buggy to take me from the metro to the hotel. Thanks to its manic rush to develop into a world-class city, Doha is a permanent construction site, crammed with glittering palaces alongside desolate building plots. It is not a pedestrian\u2019s city, however, as I discovered just outside the hotel when I plunged ankle-deep into wet concrete. A group of nearby labourers gasped in horror and amusement. I managed to extract my foot without becoming a permanent feature of the Ned \u2014 statue of dishevelled hack \u2014 but my brand-new Adidas kicks had become literal concrete shoes. I howled at the cloudless sky in frustration. Nothing is quite complete in boomtown Doha, the Ned included. But at some point, after the last World Cup goal has been scored and the kinks ironed out, when the concrete has set and the roads are open and the regular thrum of business and tourism returns to the Corniche, I expect this will become the most popular spot in town. It just needs a final heave to be ready for showtime."},

{"title": "Why Foreign Office travel advice is not fit for purpose | Travel | The Sunday Times", "author": "Chris Haslam", "date": "2023-02-21", "content": "ow much faith do you have in government travel advice? Not so long ago our trust was unwavering. If the Foreign Office said don\u2019t go, we didn\u2019t \u2014 not least because advice against non-essential travel invalidated most travel insurance. These days we\u2019re less likely to heed its warnings without question. That could be a symptom of the wider collapse of trust in government, or a growing belief that the Foreign Office is out of touch. Speaking on the   programme about the case of the imprisoned British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah, the former British ambassador to Egypt John Casson asked: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the Foreign Office travel advice for the thousands of British tourists who go to Egypt each year explain that we cannot guarantee to Last month the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, was accused of being tone deaf after advising LGBT football fans going to the World Cup in Qatar show \u201ca little bit of flex and compromise\u201d and \u201crespect the culture of your host nation\u201d. Confidence had already been shaken during the pandemic as a welter of often irrational advisories put nations off-limits, on-limits, then off-limits again, often for far longer than other countries did. Clare Williams from Norwich is one of those who has lost confidence in government advice. She said: \u201cThe advice they put out during the pandemic seemed random and often unjustified, so when they told us not to go to Sri Lanka last summer we checked advice from other countries, watched the news, contacted people who were out there and decided, on balance, that the Foreign Office was overreacting. We found insurance easily, went in July, and had a brilliant time.\u201d According to the Foreign Office, which employs 17,300 staff in diplomatic offices worldwide, it bases advice on \u201clocal knowledge from our embassies abroad, information provided by the local authorities in each country and, in some cases, information gathered by the intelligence services\u201d. It does not consult with tour operators or insurers, thereby seemingly ignoring a wealth of detailed, up-to-the-minute, native knowledge. Many in the travel industry are now encouraging the Foreign Office to exploit this asset to help to re-establish its credibility. Paul Simmonds, managing director of Battleface Insurance, said: \u201cThey could learn a lot from insurance companies and travel operators about the situation on the ground.\u201d The Steppes Travel director Jarrod Kyte has staff in about 100 countries and said: \u201cThey keep us up to date with what\u2019s happening at both national and local levels. And while I understand the enormity of the Foreign Office\u2019s task, what\u2019s frustrating is that no mechanism exists for the exchange of information between government and industry.\u201d The cracks were noticeable long before the Covid pandemic. At the inquest into the Sousse massacre in Tunisia in 2015 when 38 tourists were killed, the Foreign Office was criticised for ignoring terrorist attack intelligence. And in Nepal in the same year, delays in the lifting of a travel advisory after the earthquake in May led one Nepalese government official to describe British embassy staff as \u201carrogant, incompetent and indolent\u201d. More recently, the pandemic-era red-listing of destinations including Italy, France, Spain, South Africa, Turkey and the entire continent of South America, and the three-month-long advice against non-essential travel to Sri Lanka, after a transition of power, have further undermined confidence in a once-trusted institution. Inconsistencies exist between the advice given to British travellers and that offered to citizens of other nations. In Mexico, for example, the Spanish and French governments tell travellers to avoid 15 states, the Germans, 13, and Australia 18. The UK advises us against non-essential travel to just 10. It\u2019s not clear whether we are being sloppy or they are being overcautious, but it could make a serious difference. Advice, though, is all the Foreign Office offers. \u201cAny decision to travel to, stay in or leave a country is for you to take on the basis of the best available information from our travel advice and other sources,\u201d it said. \u201cThe government cannot make these decisions for you.\u201d The number of destinations subject to travel advisories has fallen since the end of the Covid crisis, but 48 out of the 228 nations and territories listed by the Foreign Office are at present subject to warnings against all travel, or all non-essential travel. Its website has had 119 million page views so far in 2022, but some of its advice, say tour operators, is out of date or unwarranted. Jonny Bealby of Wild Frontiers said: \u201cBy trying to give an opinion on the entire world, they have made a rod for their own back and inevitably get things wrong. They can be slow to update, far too general, ambiguous, and often overcautious. \u201cFor years they advised against travel to the Kalash region in Pakistan, even though there were no issues there whatsoever. Likewise Kashmir \u2014 when I was there in March there were 45 flights a day coming into Srinagar and even though there has not been a terrorist attack on a tourist since 2007, the Foreign Office still advises against travel to the whole region.\u201d The Foreign Office said: \u201cThe safety of British nationals is always our main priority when setting out travel advice and we provide comprehensive guidance for those travelling abroad. Travel advice is kept under constant and rigorous review. Our embassies and high commissions work with governments around the world to ensure that our advice is as up to date as possible.\u201d"},
