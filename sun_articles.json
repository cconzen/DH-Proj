The former  and   star had a glittering career winning 22 trophies the last of which was the MLS Cup with Los Angeles FC.  Bale announced his retirement on January 9, but he left nobody in any doubt how he would fill his spare time. During his time at Real Madrid the Welshman earned the nickname 'The Golfer'  and was even mocked by his own supporters for his golf obsession.  The recently retired five-time  winner has not taken long to get back into the limelight, making his PGA Tour debut at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.  He played against the likes of  . The Welsh ace was paired with professional golfer Joseph Bramlett and finished the tournament at 16 under par. Bale and Bramlett narrowly missed making the final round of the competition that resumes today after high winds postponed Sunday's action as they finished joint-16th overall. As of late 2022 Bale was playing off a handicap of two which means he is an above-average amateur golfer and is almost playing off scratch (0). The Welsh ace isn't quite as good as the professionals but has impressed recently at the\u00a0AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He will have plenty of time to improve his game now he's retired. Bale has\u00a0a three-hole golf course at his home in Wales which was built in 2018. The par three holes are modelled on a selection from\u00a0three high profile venues. The holes at Bale's mini course\u00a0are the 17th at Sawgrass, the Postage Stamp at Royal Troon and the 12th at Augusta."},

The global game is enjoyed on a national basis. , for example, is an icon in England, and maybe in other countries that receive English commentary. But he was not well known elsewhere, and the same applies to foreign versions of \u2018Motty.\u2019 In the week that John  , there was a story in Brazil that the local version of him had died. It was fake news. Galvao Bueno had not died in a car accident, and he gleefully appeared to explain that rumours of his death had been greatly exaggerated. If anything, comparing Galvao Bueno to Motson does not do full justice to the importance of the Brazilian commentator. This is no lack of respect to the extraordinary career of Motson. It is a recognition of the power of Galvao Bueno behind a microphone. First, Motson had others on a similar level - the likes of Barry Davies and the great Brian Moore at one point,  later. Bueno has no parallels. And he is also the vice of a nation and its sporting triumphs - the World Cup wins of 1994 and 2002 plus the Formula One   - in a way that marks him out as one of the most important figures in the history of Brazilian broadcasting. Now 72, Bueno really came into his own as the voice of Brazil\u2019s long awaited victory in USA 94. He is a magnificent commentator, his deep, rich voice full of clever catch phrases and able to rise to glorious crescendos. And also he is a well crafted voice of the kind of Brazilian nationalism that best expresses itself on the football field. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the same intimacy with the ball,\u201d he will utter in condemnation of weaker opponents. And when Brazil score - \u201cit was just a matter of getting the ball on the ground.\u201d When the inevitable fails to happen and Brazil are in trouble then a whine comes into his voice. It can get nasty. Back in 1990 he was angry that Brazilian defenders did not try harder to kick  . At half time in the fateful recent quarter final against Croatia he was outraged that former US international Landon Donovan had dared to criticise Brazil\u2019s performance. That match may well mark the last time he commentates on a Brazil game in a World Cup. His original intention was to retire after the tournament at home in 2014. Brazil\u2019s   against Germany in the semi final forced a rethink. He could not possibly bow out at such a low point. And so he carried on, enduring a quarter final elimination in 2018 - and then another this year, after which he stepped down from his post at TV Globo. The world - or more accurately,   - has not heard the last of him. In an age of streaming sites there will always be invitations to come back for the occasional big event. But with Galvao Bueno leaving TV Globo an era has come to an end in Brazil - just as one came to an end in England with   of John Motson. They think it's all over - and it is now."},

{"title": "Don\u2019t buy the hype.. Lionel Messi being draped in Arabian robe reminded us how flawed Qatar World Cup really was", "author": "Dave Kidd", "date": "19 Dec 2022", "content": "WAS it the greatest World Cup final? Probably. Was it the greatest   final storyline? Definitely. But was Qatar 2022 the greatest World Cup of all time? Certainly not. During the build-up to Sunday\u2019s epic it felt cartoonish and celebrity-obsessed to bill a team game as \u2018Lionel Messi versus Kylian Mbappe\u2019. But then, in a final seemingly scripted by Disney, it turned out that it really was Messi versus Mbappe . Messi finally lifted the World Cup at 35, and had an influence on Argentina\u2019s campaign as significant as that of the late Diego Maradona in 1986. And Mbappe became only the second player in history to score a World Cup final hat-trick, nicked the Golden Boot from Messi, yet still ended up a loser. The Frenchman, 24 today, ought to have been man of the match, because his ailing team, struggling with the effects of a virus, barely turned up for 80 minutes until his dramatic two-goal intervention forced extra-time. There has been a concerted effort from Fifa\u2019s clown overlord Gianni Infantino and Qatari stooges to paint this tournament as the best ever \u2014 and a great final played into their hands. But just in case we were inclined to forget the corruption, human rights abuses and the sheer\u00a0nonsense of holding a World Cup in a tiny nation with no footballing culture, a farcical trophy presentation reminded us that this last month had been deeply flawed. In a final piece of \u2018sportswashing\u2019, Messi was draped in a traditional Arabian bisht robe, tarnishing images of the trophy lift, the crowning glory of a magnificent career. But then  , and is also an ambassador for Saudi Arabia. However beautiful a footballer he may be, and however romantic the story of his World Cup triumph had seemed, this fella is raking in tens of millions from some ruthless people. And then there was Infantino, trying to hog the limelight and gatecrash Argentina\u2019s celebrations. The man is a prized twit, a deranged attention-seeker in hock to oppressive dictators, a glove\u00a0puppet for Vladimir Putin, the Emir of Qatar and the Saudis, whom he would love to host the 2030 World Cup. In purely footballing terms, this was one of the better World Cups. But anybody who went to Qatar will tell you that the overall \u00a0tournament experience was a sham. This became immediately apparent at the opening match when hapless Qatar \u2014 easily the worst host team in World Cup history \u2014 were well beaten by Ecuador in a largely silent stadium, which was half-empty soon after half-time as the locals gave up and went home. Only the South American and north African nations brought \u00a0significant support and so the atmosphere at most matches was thoroughly weird \u2014 stadiums \u00a0dominated by neutral tourists and Mexican Waves and Icelandic \u00a0thunderclaps. When Cristiano Ronaldo was dropped and Portugal hammered Switzerland 6-1, Ronaldo still received the night\u2019s shrillest cheer when he arrived as a late sub \u2014 a far more rapturous ovation than that afforded to his replacement Goncalo Ramos, who scored a \u00a0brilliant hat-trick. And some of the World Cup\u2019s best bits are now under threat from Fifa. The expansion of the event to 48 teams, from 2026, will make it bloated and lop-sided. Some of this tournament\u2019s greatest drama arrived with the final group-stage matches, as two games ran concurrently and fortunes \u00a0fluctuated wildly. Germany were eliminated by a controversial Japanese winner against Spain and Uruguay\u2019s \u00a0villains were dumped out by South Korea\u2019s injury-time clincher against Portugal. Yet at the next World Cup, we face having \u00a012 groups of four, which would allow some third-placed teams to progress, and not others, also affecting those group-stage climaxes. England had a good tournament and many of us initially felt that, if Harry Kane had scored his second penalty, rather than ballooning it, Gareth Southgate\u2019s men might have won the World Cup. Yet while England possess some very good footballers, including some improving youngsters, they do not have a game-changing match-winner like Mbappe or Messi.  Mbappe would probably have \u00a0conjured a moment of brilliance to defeat England in extra-time. If not, Messi would probably have done so in the final. And that is to ignore Morocco, the first African World Cup semi-finalists \u2014 a huge achievement from an obdurate team, fired by fanatical support. There were shades of 1982 about Brazil, who provided outstanding individual brilliance. Tottenham\u2019s Richarlison was a star but his team ultimately under-achieved by losing a quarter-final shootout to \u00a0Croatia \u2014 and what a stunning feat for that small nation to finish second and third at \u00a0consecutive World Cups. Argentina\u2019s quarter-final victory over Holland was wild and wonderfully ill-tempered. While most of us wanted to see Argentina prevail in the final, for Messi\u2019s sake, let us not forget their antics as they taunted the fallen Dutch after their shootout win. The refereeing was largely \u00a0excellent and unfussy in Qatar \u2014 final ref Szymon Marciniak in \u00a0particular \u2014 and VAR functioned unusually well. But let\u2019s not allow Infantino to bask in the glory of a great final and attempt to normalise winter World Cups in the Middle East. Don\u2019t let them tell you, either, that the absence of alcohol helped. There hasn\u2019t been significant crowd violence at a World Cup since 1998. Infantino will be desperate to get the event to Saudi Arabia in 2030 \u2014 another disruptive mid-season \u00a0tournament in a dry country under a barbaric regime. If it happens, with the Saudis as outright hosts or in a weird joint bid with Egypt and Greece, Messi will surely be in Riyadh as a handsomely paid patsy. He is a wonderful footballer and on Sunday he illuminated a \u00a0wonderful football match. But let\u2019s not pretend Messi is a saint and let\u2019s not pretend that Qatar 2022 was a proper World Cup at all, let alone the greatest one."},

A recent YouGov poll found 66 per cent of the public support the nurses\u2019 walkout and 63 per cent back the  In contrast,   enjoy just 43 per cent support for striking, and Transport for London staff only 36 per cent. Could this mean our nurses would have preferred a reasonable pay rise over our politicians\u2019 fawning and the public clapping like seals? Surely not. While there is an argument to be had about whether it should be illegal for emergency service workers to strike, clearly we are too far gone. But the  has turned from a once-loved public asset to a liability.  Few would deny that the recent strikes are a culmination of decades of NHS mismanagement and poor planning.  Even for swathes of the country where people hoped that taking back control of   \u2014 which we still await with bated breath \u2014 would reduce the pressure on our public health system, this is yet to have materialised. The reality is that discontent with the NHS is being felt acutely all around, from medical professionals to actual patients. For too long, quality patient care has taken a back seat because politicians are happy to worship at the feet of the creaking NHS rather than facing certain realities head-on. NHS wait times are the highest they have ever been, with almost three million people waiting for more than 18 weeks to receive treatment.  A recent revelation that will shock absolutely no one is that NHS waiting lists have reached a record high of almost 7.21million people. For years, the NHS has faced chronic understaffing, poor staff reten-tion, outdated IT systems and falling bed numbers. Is this what Britons deserve?  To be treated by unhappy, overworked and underpaid staff who have been driven to the point of desperation with their strike action? Do we deserve to wait weeks for lifesaving treatment \u201cfree at the point of need\u201d?  When you need it, it\u2019s nowhere to be found. I have spoken to elderly people who are so concerned with NHS wait times and their that they have all but given up. Are we happy to force sub-optimal healthcare on to the public because everyone gets to have a slice of that mediocre pie? Even Shadow Health Secretary , an otherwise unlikely voice of reason, has realised that the NHS is not in fact the \u201cenvy of the world\u201d. How could it be? Where else is our public healthcare model emulated around the world?  Which other country is unreasonable enough to keep this maddening socialist experiment alive against all the odds? Even when net immigration is topping half a million a year and NHS spending has never been higher. The nightmare we are facing isn\u2019t unique to England and Wales either. Earlier this week,  voted overwhelmingly to reject an NHS pay offer, with strike action set to begin in the New Year. Alongside the myriad other problems this country is facing, not least the soaring  , this will deal another blow to the Government. Will the NHS strikes be the final push we need to have an honest, common-sense conversation about the NHS\u2019s future? I desperately hope so. The entire operation is unsustainable. We are at a crossroads. It is either reform the NHS or lose more lives at the hands of incompetent politicians and fed-up medical workers. I MAY still be recovering from France\u2019s inability to keep smug  and the Argentines from lifting the  . Despite a valiant effort from the likes of France\u2019s   it was simply not to be for Les Bleus. Nonetheless, despite all the moaning, groaning, and virtue-signalling,  hosted an excellent World Cup. Unlike at the Euros last year, British football fans behaved impeccably. Could this have had something to do with the  ? Perhaps. But the bigger takeaway is that Qatar stood firm \u2013 undeterred by virtue-signalling celebrities who were happy to take millions from Qatari state broadcasters then complain about Qatar\u2019s human rights record. Qatar ran a well-oiled machine that kept out as much political intrusion as possible, barring the odd rainbow flag and pitch runner. England should take a cue from this \u2013 less complaining, more action. WE should all hang our heads in shame at how  was treated. As a Brit, I am deeply embarrassed. It has been revealed the Queen\u2019s former lady-in-waiting is a member of a church with a \u201c90 per cent black congregation\u201d, many of Nigerian or Ghanaian descent. Her congregation, like me, were equally irate at the fact her curiosity had her  and ruthlessly dismissed by the Royal Family. After six decades of service to the Palace, she wasn\u2019t even given the courtesy of a full investigation when she faced claims of racism. If people like myself and Lady Hussey\u2019s congregation hadn\u2019t spoken up, she would have been eternally condemned without a chance to defend herself. Sad as this is, it is also unsurprising. We have let our country become so neutered by race-baiting and divisive politics that a simple allegation of wrongdoing is all it takes to be nationally humiliated. What happened to innocent until proven guilty? Or even basic justice?  Not in the era of pronouns and critical race theory. There was once a time when Britain respected its elders.  In this era of cancel culture, I fear that is all but lost. THIS week Rishi Sunak backed the High Court ruling that the Rwanda policy was lawful. Recent statements and initiatives by the PM, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman, make it clear the Government has a holy trinity plan to tackle illegal immigration. The Tories seem to be trying to cover all bases.  Deeper cooperation with the French and Belgians to tackle boat crossings, reviving the shaky plan to fly out excess migrants for \u201cprocessing\u201d, and opening \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for asylum seekers. I suspect the latter will be a measly stall at the port of Calais resembling a chicken coop. Like everyone else, I await the Government\u2019s plan to expand these safe routes.  At the very least, I hope it will filter between economic migrants and genuine asylum seekers. WE need a good dose of masculinity to carve up our roasts this  . Every year, we hear horror stories from women about how draining it is to plan for the festivities. Nosy relatives, putting up decorations, Christmas shopping, gift-wrapping \u2013 it\u2019s always the same whinging and moaning from lifestyle magazines that sell women closets full of bandage dresses and oestrogen patches. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time to hear about the contributions that men make.  From carving the roast to mowing the lawn, taking out the bins and even checking the blinking lights on the in-law\u2019s car dashboard, men do plenty during the holiday season. Gone are the days of them just drinking beer while watching football. Years of unintelligible screeching from feminists have led to an equitable distribution of tasks, with men doing their fair share in the home. Let\u2019s think about that next time the hubby is stopping the in-law\u2019s children from discolouring walls around the house or keeping everyone else up at night."},

As luxury as it is this is a ship for ALL \u2014 the World Europa is currently sailing on Middle Eastern itineraries from   with prices from \u00a3679pp for a seven-night full-board holiday. From April it will be sailing the   and you can enjoy a two-night cruise from Genoa to   from \u00a3169pp. It demonstrates you can still holiday like the A-listers next year \u2014 without the hefty price tag. And with everything included, it\u2019s the perfect foil to the cost-of-living \u00adcrises.  Seven-night sailings onboard the MSC World Europa this winter are from \u00a31,257pp including flights from \u00ad  and transfers. See \u00ad . For summer Med sailings, prices are from \u00a31,333pp including flights and transfers, based on the April 16 sailing from Genoa, calling at Naples, Messina,  , Barcelona and   before returning to Genoa. See  .  With money tight for Sun readers, due to the cost-of-living crisis, I\u2019ll be making sure we travel to some of the best value destinations across the globe to report on how you can make your holiday pounds go further. The beaches of   and   are on my list \u2014 as well as the   and Northumbrian coasts for some good-value stay\u00adcation ideas. IT\u2019S certainly been a crazy 2022 filled with firsts for me, despite having been in this industry for seven years. I went on my first cruise, boarding the Disney Wish to the Bahamas, my first visit to   on Tui\u2019s new flights to   and my first business-class experience thanks to Finnair. And I can hardly forget my first time in  \u2014 glorious wifi-free days on an island in Columbia thanks to Corona beer. But if there is one standout trip, it was to Puerto Rico, below, after a visit during their biggest celebration of the year, Noche de San Juan. A break packed with fascinating traditions, colourful streets and all-night partying. It may not be the first place in the US you\u2019d think to visit but it should definitely be one to consider if you are in nearby Miami, or opting for a Caribbean cruise. And Senegal proved to be such a surprise hit.  newest winter-sun destination offered so much more than just fly and flop, with the chance to discover the unique flora, fauna and geography.  You can save up to \u00a3250 on summer holidays with Tui in its Boxing Day sale, now on. Seven nights\u2019 all-inclusive at the Riu Baobab in Senegal is from \u00a3981pp, including Gatwick flights on May 1. See  .  I hope my new experiences will continue, with plans for my first trip to   \u2014 which, given the present temp\u00aderatures in the UK, is especially warming to think about right now. IT\u2019S hard to believe now, but 2022 was my first year of foreign holidays since 2018 thanks to navigating the pandemic with a young child \u2014 so taking off on that first flight with my partner and our son was a big highlight. But I\u2019ve more than made up for it since, with trips abroad to  , Kefalonia, Disneyland Paris,   twice and  . Highlights have to be a blissful sunrise swim off the coast of Ibiza, hiring a boat and ex\u00adploring a \u201cdeserted island\u201d with family and friends near my all-time favourite, St Mawes in  , and watching my three-year-old glow with happiness while handling a JCB at Diggerland in Kent. Experiencing the glorious British Airways First Class lounge at Gatwick is also something I won\u2019t forget in a long time. My favourite trip was our week in  , though \u2014 beach picnics with spanakopita and beef tomatoes, endless hours in our villa pool where my son fell in love with swimming, rustic al fresco tavernas with sea views and a perfect day moored off the stunning coast in our rental boat.  Book before January 31 and you can bag a holiday in Kefalonia from \u00a3392pp, including flights, in the British Airways sale (see  ). Or book budget flights with easyJet from Gatwick to Kefalonia from \u00a325.99 each way in April 2023 (see  ).  I hope to enjoy my first ski trip in four years and to go on a child-friendly holiday in  ."},

He said in 2022: \u201cI will never forget it. That was a childhood dream come true and then it ended in the most absurd fashion and I never got over it. \u201cThe people always showed me great love and affection, they understood my suffering, but I am very demanding with myself. \u201cI had a thousand opportunities to miss a penalty in my career, that was the one I really couldn\u2019t miss.\u201d The mystery footballer is of course...

Baggio retired in 2004 and spent time as Italian football's technical director alongside his various charity work.

{"title": "Kieran Tierney reveals how he gets inside information on Celtic\u2019s Japanese stars from Arsenal teammate Takehiro Tomiyasu", "author": null, "date": "25 Jan 2023", "content": "THE Rising Sun over Paradise is dazzling for former Celtic hero and lifelong fan Kieran\u00a0Tierney. \u2019s stunning fusion of Japanese talent with the Hoops\u2019 title-winning squad has grabbed the imagination of the \u00a325million ace. And Arsenal defender\u00a0 \u00a0is well placed for all the inside info on the Far East stars brought to Parkhead by Postecoglou - and taking the Premiership by storm. Gunners\u2019 team-mate and Japan international Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2013 known simply as Tomi by the Arsenal players and staff - effectively becomes\u00a0Tierney\u2019s Wikipedia when it comes to checking out incomers. Celtic now boast six Japanese players; Yuki Kobayashi, Yosuke Ideguchi, Tomoki Iwata, Reo Hatate,   and Daizen Maeda. And thanks to Tomiyasu, KT\u2019s got a dossier in his mind of each of them. Only the out in the cold Ideguchi has failed to make an impact and could well exit before this month\u2019s transfer window closes. Centre-half Kobayashi\u2019s just beginning to bed in after two solid displays while midfielder Iwata made a debut from the bench in the Scottish Cup victory over Morton.\u00a0 Overall, ex-Yokohama Marinos boss Postecoglou\u2019s inside knowledge of the J-League has paid rich dividends for Celtic. And\u00a0Tierney\u2019s gripped by the Japanese dynamic within a bull-dozing team that\u2019s won 24 of 26 domestic games this season, losing just one. The 25-year-old told SunSport: \u201cI speak to Tomi a lot. \u201cI didn\u2019t know much about the boys who came in from Japan before and it\u2019s the same with the two signed over the last month. \u201cI don\u2019t see the J-League and so I\u2019ve been asking Tomi for info and his thoughts on them as players. \u201cDaizen Maeda was with Tomi in the Japan squad for the World Cup in Qatar. \u201cTomi\u2019s been very positive about all the boys signed and that\u2019s been good to hear. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player himself and an excellent team-mate. He\u2019s good company. \u201cI\u2019m always speaking to Tomi and if ever there\u2019s a Celtic game on at the training ground he sits and watches it with me. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to make him a Celtic fan! \u201cIt\u2019s funny, but Tomi\u2019s seen that old video of me being presented with boots by Shunsuke Nakamura when I was just a kid at Celtic. \u201cHe was aware of it a long time ago. \u201cNakamura was one of Tomi\u2019s heroes growing up, but that goes for so many of the Japanese players all over the world.\u201d Foreign players have unquestionably added plenty for Celtic over the years. But for\u00a0Tierney\u00a0it\u2019s also important there remains a Scottish core \u2013 and he\u2019s thrilled close pals  , Greg Taylor,   and James Forrest continue to be at the heart of the Postecoglou revolution. Tony Ralston and Stephen Welsh have also made decent contributions since the Greek-Aussie landed the hot-seat 19-months ago. Tierney\u00a0\u2013 previously on record as saying a future second spell at Celtic would be appealing and still the owner of two season tickets \u2013 said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important for there to be a Scottish presence in the team. \u201cOr, at least, people who have grown up knowing everything about the club and have got the mentality of needing to win. \u201cCallum was seven or eight when he joined and he\u2019s had that winning mentality from that age all the way up. \u201cAnd now as captain with every player coming in from different clubs and countries he\u2019s able to help them settle quickly on and off the park. They\u2019re made aware of the necessary standards. \u201cRight now it looks like every signing just clicks, buys into Celtic immediately. They all seem to be doing so well. \u201cCallum\u2019s a brilliant captain. But I had no doubt in my mind he would be successful with the armband. No one in the club had doubts. \u201cI know how much it means to Callum, how professional he is and how much he gives to the club. \u201cHe deserves every bit of success he gets \u2013 and I\u2019m sure by the end of the season he\u2019ll have two more trophies to lift. \u201cJamesy now has 100 goals and 100 assists. He\u2019s a club legend. What he\u2019s done over all those years \u2013 is it 14 now? \u2013 is amazing. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many players able to say they\u2019ve done what he is. He\u2019s in the history books. \u201cLike Callum, he\u2019s another brilliant guy. \u201cGreg, for me, is a contender for player of the year. He came through a hard time at Celtic with the Covid situation and the missing out on 10. \u201cBut we always knew he was going to be a great player for the club. \u201cGreg\u2019s different from me. He\u2019s got his own strengths. He\u2019s very technical and on the ball he\u2019s among the best there is. \u201cI\u2019m so happy he\u2019s established himself in the team. I love him as a person and we text each other weekly. \u201cDavid\u2019s another top lad and excellent player \u2013 a good friend \u2013 while Tony and Stephen are others who can be proud of their contribution after coming through the ranks.\u201d Tierney\u2019s a huge fan also of Postecoglou. He added: \u201cWhat Celtic have done, and are doing just now, is amazing. \u201cI was gutted for them in the Champions League. I felt they deserved so much more for their performances. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey they\u2019re on in Europe. It\u2019s a bit like Arsenal, steady progress. People can see where you\u2019re going, what you\u2019re trying to do. \u201cAnge Postecoglou\u2019s bought right into the club. That\u2019s why the fans love him. He\u2019s adored. \u201cMy friends talk about him; certain clips, certain interviews. \u201cEven when he wears a certain JUMPER people are buying it. You can tell how much he\u2019s loved.\u201d Tierney was born on the Isle of Man and lived in London for the last three and a half years. But you\u2019ll never take Wishaw out of him. Tierney\u00a0moved to the North Lanarkshire town when he was only 10-months old. He\u2019s confessed it took him over a year to settle in London after his record transfer from Celtic to Arsenal but now feels comfortable. Tierney, however, insisted no matter where his career takes him he\u2019ll always pine for where he was raised. He said: \u201cI\u2019ll always miss home, but I\u2019m a lot more settled than the first year, 18-months for sure. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that I\u2019m now in my fourth season at Arsenal. It feels like it\u2019s flown in. \u201cTo be at a club like this with over 100 appearances is very good and it\u2019s something that no one can take away from me. \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet life for me here. I don\u2019t do much. \u201cI\u2019m not one for going out on the town, I don\u2019t go into London very often. \u201cI train, I go home, I recover, the odd time I\u2019ll go out for a bit of food local. \u201cBut it\u2019s all good, it suits me fine. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of me ever being big-headed or have an ego. That\u2019s just the way I\u2019ve been brought up. I\u2019d never want to be like that anyway, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair on my family. \u201cI was brought up proper with manners. \u201cI\u2019ll always just be myself.\u201d Tierney\u2019s childhood pals have never eased up on banter as his career\u2019s rocketed \u2013 and that\u2019s suited him perfectly. His public status is undeniable but as far as he\u2019s concerned he\u2019ll always just be one of the boys. He said: \u201cSometimes my pals speak about football but, honestly, not as often as you\u2019d think. \u201cI\u2019ll come home after a game or training and it\u2019s like \u2018what time are you on the Playstation tonight?\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of comments on my performances or anything that\u2019s happened in the games. \u201cIt\u2019s a good get-out, I like that. I can get away from things. \u201cMy pals knew me before I became a professional footballer. \u201cPut it this way, they don\u2019t cut me any slack for being a football player \u2013 I still get SLAGGED as much as ever!\u201d Meanwhile,\u00a0Tierney\u2019s \u00a325 million price tag \u2013 a record for Scottish football \u2013 doesn\u2019t weigh heavily on him. He said: \u201cMaybe when I first joined it was on my mind. \u201cIn terms of some of the transfer fees down here it\u2019s not much. \u201cBut, obviously, it\u2019s the most expensive Scottish one. \u201cI don\u2019t feel pressure from it, just pride.\u00a0 \u201cFor somebody who has come from the Celtic academy and a working class background, to go on and be a \u00a325million football player \u2013 well, that makes me proud. \u201cI never thought it was going to change who I was or what people thought of me. \u201cI\u2019ve worked very hard to get to this level and I\u2019ll never ease up.\u201d Tierney is confident   can hit the ground running in the upcoming Euro qualifiers. Three of our opening four fixtures are at Hampden, starting with Cyprus and Spain in March. Both are sell-outs as is the eagerly awaited home friendly against England next September as the Tartan Army truly show their backing for Steve Clarke\u2019s national team, with only the tie against Georgia on June 20 still having tickets available from our scheduled Hampden fixtures in 2023. Key man\u00a0Tierney\u00a0rates it \u2018vital\u2019 we get off to a great start. He told SunSport: \u201cI love it when international duty\u2019s coming up because I love playing for Scotland, I love representing my country. \u201cThe feeling about the camp is very good. \u201cI love the manager, I love his staff and I\u2019m grateful for every chance I get to play. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve been injured and missed games. So I don\u2019t take any camp, training session or match for granted. \u201cIt will be very important for us to start the Euro qualifiers well. We\u2019ve got Cyprus and Spain at home in March and they\u2019ll be tough ties. \u201cBut we\u2019re at Hampden and we have to believe in ourselves. \u201cQualification for another tournament is something we really want to achieve. \u201cMissing out on the World Cup was a massive disappointment for everyone after the experience of playing in the Euro finals. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough group we\u2019re in with Norway also there. \u201cBut the manager\u2019s always emphasising we have to be full of belief. That we CAN qualify.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s always hammering home the message we have to change our mentality that Scotland don\u2019t qualify for tournaments and the Euros were a one off. \u201cWe need to be a team fighting for every position, every point. It doesn\u2019t matter the opposition, it\u2019s about going out and looking for points and qualifying.\u201d Tierney, though, confessed losing captain and goalkeeper \u2013 broken leg victim   \u2013 is a major blow. He added: \u201cI was gutted when I learned about Craig. It\u2019s the horrendous side of football. I hope he\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be out. \u201cBut I wish him the best. \u201cI noticed Craig saying on Instagram that people had doubted him before and that people have written him off in the past after bad injuries. \u201cBut if anyone knows how to come back from something it\u2019s Craig Gordon.\u201d Tierney, meanwhile, stressed again he\u2019s got no problem turning out wherever Clarke needs him. Left-back for Arsenal, left-sided centre-half for Scotland. He added: \u201cListen, it\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019m delighted wherever he plays me. \u201cThe other week I came off the bench for Arsenal and played left wing. \u201cI\u2019ll give my all in every position. \u201cI\u2019m now used to being centre-back in a three \u2013 the majority of my caps have been there. \u201cThere\u2019s great competition for left-back with Andy Robertson and Greg Taylor. \u201cBut, just to play, I\u2019ll turn out anywhere for Scotland.\u201d"},

From  as celebrities in their own right to branching out independently with their own business ventures, many are   of their other halves. But, maybe, these women took it a little too far when they dissed their player's clubs, cities they play in and even rival players. Here's a selection of footballers' Wags who have rebelled. One of the most fiery Wags around,   is the ex-wife of forward Mauro Icardi. When Inter Milan brought in   to replace her former husband, the blonde beauty was not impressed. After it was posed to her on Italian TV that Lukaku was more of a team player than Icardi, she retored: \"It would be good to see [Lukaku] in big games too. \"He hasn't scored in the\u00a0Champions League, he'll watch the knockout rounds on TV.\" She added: \"The last No. 9 only scored about 150 goals for Inter.\" Despite boasting plenty of restaurants in the Michelin guide,   doesn't cut it for Man City ace Ilkay Gundogan's wife, Sara. When quizzed on her favourite restaurant in the city, she said: \"Sorry I'm sad to be honest but nothing. I tried so bad to find a good restaurant but... horrible food everywhere. \"Can't find a real Italian or good sushi or just fresh food .. everything frozen. Restaurants here are just focus on making money with drinks and shot like night clubs not quality food. \"Maybe in London but in Manchester nothing. I'm sorry.\" Bona fide celeb   is not one to mince her words - and it was ex-Portugal boss Fernando Santos who felt her wrath during the World Cup in Qatar. Santos, a father-figure to her husband  , made the difficult decision to drop CR7 against Morocco. Portugal went on to lose the game 1-0 and were knocked out at the quarter-final stage. After the game, Georgina shared on Instagram: \"Today your friend and coach made a bad decision. That friend for whom you have so many words of admiration and respect. \"The same as when you got into the game, he saw how everything changed, but it was too late. \"The best player in the world, his most powerful weapon, cannot be underestimated. \"You can't stand up for someone who doesn't deserve it either. Life gives us lessons. \"Today we have not lost, we have learned.\"  Maja is a blogger from Sweden - with a huge social media following. So, it wouldn't have gone unnoticed when she blasted Man Utd's prices for their 'disgusting' boxes at Old Trafford.  \"Here the players have the option to rent a box and I'm not even going to tell you for how much but a disgusting amount of money,\" she said on her podcast\u00a0Livet P\u00e5 L\u00e4ktaren. \"And if you don't buy one you're considered to be a loser. \"But having a box is wonderful because you have your own waiter.\" While crosstown rival Sara had it in for Manchester's restaurant scene, pop star Edurne dislikes the whole city itself. In fact, David De Gea's wife branded the place \"uglier than the back of a fridge\". Madrid-born Garciaalso told Spanish TV the only reason she spends time in Manchester is because of  Pablo Motos, host of\u00a0entertainment show El Hormiguero, kicked off the discussion asking: \"I've been told Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge.\" Garcia replied: \"It's not very nice, that's for sure. You have to hunt out specific places, the nicer places. \"But even then Spain is nicer. The reason I like it is because David's there. With him being there, everything looks wonderful.\" If their boxes are getting slammed, it's the way   handle transfers that also got under the skin of this particular Wag. Sergio Romero's wife Eliana was fuming they didn't let him leave for Everton on transfer deadline day in 2020, after all he had given the club too. She blasted on Instagram: \"Sergio Romero worked hard for the club. The last trophy they won, they lifted it with him. He helped the team reach four finals/semi-finals and then he was left on the bench only to lose them all.\" She then pleaded with them to let him go - and demanded respect for her husband. When ex-Arsenal star   and insisted they \"got on his nerves\", Jessica - the wife of German star Diego Contento - barked back. She told\u00a0 : \"In general, I cannot understand his statement.\u00a0Here the clich\u00e9 is taken up again, against which many player women, including myself, have been fighting for years. \"That's not okay, he lumps everyone together.\" Contento continued: \"The fact is that with such a statement you have no chance of being perceived differently, for example as an entrepreneur, mother or working woman who does not depend on the man. \"But when you make such a statement as such a great personality, you reinforce the negative image of the player's wife, with which many women struggle. \"That also speaks against the principles that a football player pursues in a club.\""},

It could be tough for City to seal a deal for the 18-year-old as he recently signed a new contract with the Belgian outfit.

No-nonsense boss   made it very clear before the game that despite a seven game winning run and the opposition coming from the middle of League one he wanted no let-up. \u201cThey all know that 99 per cent is insufficient. We need 100 per cent focus, concentration and dedication at all times..\u201d he wrote in his programme notes. He got that in a first half that   totally dominated. The Red Devils looked every bit the top four Premier League side and Charlton the 12 \u00a0placed side from the third tier. This despite the fact that Ten Hag made eight changes from the side\u00a0that had beaten Everton last Friday night to progress into the fourth round of the FA Cup. The thing is he has improved so many individuals in his time at Old Trafford and recruited so well that what once looked a flimsy squad now looks strong. He showed that he is prepared to follow the tradition of giving youth a chance too with a first call up for 17-year-old Stockport born  to play in the number ten role. Three years after signing 21-year-old Facundo Pellistri even made his first appearance as a late sub. At the other end of the scale 20 years after joining the club as a trainee, Tom Heaton was making his full debut for the club in goal at the age of 36. Not that he had a lot to do in the first half with all the action down the other end. Alejandro Garnacho was looking particularly lively down the left where   twice found him with Crossfield balls. Both times he chose to cut inside and have a shot of his own but missed the target each time. The deadlock was broken courtesy of   from Ajax and his second in successive games after scoring against Everton. United moved the ball neatly and when Fred fed him wide on the wing the chance came. He was afforded far too much time and room to do what he likes to do which is cut in from the right and curl a shot with his left. This one moved perfectly beyond the grasp of Ashley Maynard-Brewer and tucked itself just inside the far post. Fred almost added to that lead with a 38 \u00a0minute free kick from 22 yards that crashed off the inside of the left-hand upright. As far as Charlton were concerned, an Albie Morgan free-kick which flew wide was all they had to offer the 9,000 visiting fans. Recently appointed Addicks boss Dean Holden had lead his side to much needed back to back wins ahead of this game so changed only the goalkeeper from the side that beat Lincoln. Holden a United fan once snuck into the ground dressed as a steward to watch United take on Borussia Dortmund back in 1997. Salford born and still a Red Devils fan he has held a season ticket for 30 years. But he was desperate to spring a shock against the club he loves and take Charlton further then they have ever gone in the competition. At 1-0 his side were still in touch and certainly started the second-half like this would be more of a competition. When Albie Morgan played a ball back to Scott Fraser in space on the edge of the area an early second-half chance opened up but he blazed his shot over. That would be as near as they would come and a minute from time   made the game safe when set up by Pellistri to tuck the ball away. He would add a second in injury time. He has now scored in eight successive games here and it is\u00a0eight wins in a row now for Ten Hag."},

Since his announcement social media has been awash with praise for the ex-Real Madrid star - with some fans going as far as calling him the G.O.A.T. In a glittering career the Welsh hero won five   trophies and lead   to a   semi-final. Very few players can boast as impressive a trophy cabinet as Gareth, which also includes three La Liga titles, a Copa Del Rey and even silverware for Spurs. But are trophies alone enough to call him the greatest British footballer of all time? Below our pundits and writers name their top pick.

He may not have the speed of a gazelle, the tricks of a circus chimp or the surging runs of a   bull. But he has the rat-like cunning of a true predator.  Gentleman Harry is the glue that holds this   generation together. ENGLAND, 2000-2014  114 21 THOUGH he never won the   and, with England, was part of the under-achieving so-called golden generation, in my book he is as great as anyone. With  , you felt their trophies wouldn\u2019t have been won without him.  There was that corker of a last-minute equaliser against West Ham in the 2006   final and his incredible second-half performance in   to win the Champions League in 2005. Always trying harder and seeming to care more than anyone else, time and again he was unstoppable.  His love for the game \u2013 and his club \u2013 shone out. And he didn\u2019t seem to care much for the trappings of his fame. He must be the only player of his generation who, boy and man, stuck with the same haircut.  A mark of greatness in my book all day long. ENGLAND, 1983-1995  79  11 PERCHED on the sofa at home in 1986, I screamed at the TV as cheating Maradona\u2019s Argentina were 2-0 up against England in the World Cup quarter-final.

He also holds the record for the most appearances of any outfield player for England. Along with former team-mate  , he is the only player to win the Premier League, the FA Cup, the  , the  , the FIFA Club World Cup and the Champions League.  He is still England\u2019s youngest ever goal scorer (17).  He played in three World Cups and won the England Player of the Year Award four times. Wazza also played football like a tank on roller skates and always attacked the opposing team like a primate on steroids. Oh, and to cap it all, he never played for  . Job done. SCOTLAND, 1971-1986  102 30 WHEN my first kid was on the way we were only ever going to have a girl or a Kenny. Dalglish was the most creative footballer   ever produced. But even more than that, a guy who played the game not so much with a smile on his face as a grin that split it in two. Every time he scored \u2013 250-plus times for  ,   and Scotland \u2013 his happiness lit up the dreariest day. He loved putting the ball in the net, he loved setting up goals. He just loved being on that pitch, full stop.  That\u2019s what I wanted for my kids \u2013 for them not just to love whatever they chose to do but to let the world see that they loved it. Because when you radiate happiness, it can\u2019t help but brighten up the lives of all those around you. King Kenny had so many talents as a player. He saw passes others could only dream of and he calculated angles like a maths genius. But it\u2019s the joy he took from doing what he did that set him apart as my hero. ENGLAND, 1988-1998  57 10 THERE have been many great British footballers down the years but none that stirred the soul quite like  . He was quick, strong, impish, swashbuckling and wondrously skilful. Gazza, in full, glorious flight, was a supreme entertainer. And if it hadn\u2019t been for injuries and his addiction issues he would be right up there in the same conversation as the two Ronaldos, Maradona,   and Pele as one of the world\u2019s all-time greats. Gazza was indisputably the most fantastic character to ever play the game \u2013 a hyperactive, ebullient, crazy bundle of Geordie fun never happier than when he was pulling pranks on team-mates, opponents or even referees. But with a football at his feet, he was a genius and, for me, the British GOAT. NORTHERN IRELAND, 1964-1977  37  9 HE was a player who had it all. He could run like an antelope, pass, dribble, score with both feet, ride the most brutal tackles, head the ball better than most and, if nothing else was on, nutmeg a defender.  had the genius to do it and knew, instinctively, he was in the entertainment industry.  Just listen to Pele, who described him as \u201ca footballer without comparison\u201d and so good \u201call you could do was foul him\u201d. If George was a clean-cut, Home Counties people pleaser there wouldn\u2019t even be any debate about his supremacy.  But he was a tormented soul from east   who, when he got bored of being better than everyone else, went to the pub and never really came back. George walked out on Manchester United aged just 27 and ended his significant playing days with   instead of rising to even greater glory than he\u2019d known at Old Trafford and signing for  . Oh Georgie Boy. What might have been. WALES, 2006-2022  111 41 IT is easy to make the case for a number of players if you use a multitude of factors. Some of those factors are relevant \u2013 longevity, success, big moments. Some just aren\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter if   was injured a lot. It doesn\u2019t matter if he retired early. It doesn\u2019t matter if he wasn\u2019t at his best at the last World Cup and it doesn\u2019t matter if he loves   more than football (allegedly). What matters is talent. On his day, and in his generation, the only two other players who could grab a game and win it all on their own were two of the greatest of all time, Lionel Messi and  . Bale was capable of majestic, powerful, skilful, unflinching, inspirational football. He carried the game in Wales from a laughing stock to the pride of Britain at Euro 2016 and to a first World Cup in 64 years in 2022. Maybe it was all too fleeting, I don\u2019t care. Unless you reached those incredible heights you can\u2019t get into the conversation with Gareth. He was The Best. ENGLAND, 1958-1970  106  59 WITH a thunderbolt shot, exquisite, slide-rule passes and raw athleticism,   was the complete footballer. And Bobby won it all. The World Cup, the European Cup, three First Division titles and the FA Cup. Not only that but he was a consummate gentleman who played the game with a British sense of fair play.  No backchat to referees or disrespect for opponents. Can you imagine Bobby \u2013 a survivor of the   \u2013 rolling around feigning an injury? In that glorious summer of \u201966 Bobby scored three goals on the way to the final before winning the Ballon d\u2019Or as Europe\u2019s best footballer. As his Man Utd manager Sir Matt Busby said: \u201cHe was as near perfection as man and player as it is possible to be.\u201d ENGLAND, 1959-1967  57 44 JIMMY was a goal-scoring genius. The hat-trick king. No other player excited me like  . At Tottenham I\u2019d watch him dribble through the defence before scoring the most incredible goals. Lionel Messi does it now but Greavsie was playing on pitches that were a sea of mud. He scored an incredible 266 goals for Spurs. I have watched Gareth Bale, Gazza and Bobby Moore, but Jimmy, although he was only 5ft 8in, stood head and shoulders above them.  When I started covering   matches I switched allegiance. Jimmy joined The Hammers and, as he did at every club he joined, he scored on his debut \u2013 two goals in a 5-1 victory at  . Despite him not being in that amazing \u201966 World Cup team, to me he was Britain\u2019s greatest footballer. ENGLAND, 1962-1973  108 2 WIPING the mud from his hand like a true gent,   accepted the Jules Rimet Trophy from a delighted  , the only Brit ever to do it. But it\u2019s not just that trophy that makes Bobby the greatest. He was the ultimate defender \u2013 a fantastic tackler who was brilliant in the air and who glided over the turf as he began an attack. His reading of the game was astonishing, too. Bobby was also a captain and leader who inspired the players around him to greater heights.  Don\u2019t just take it from me. Pele called him the greatest defender he\u2019d ever played against. Ex-  captain Franz Beckenbauer described Bobby as \u201cthe best defender in the history of the game\u201d, while   called him \u201cthe best defender I have ever seen\u201d. ENGLAND, 1992-2000  63 30 AS a Geordie, I have to go with my local hero. For me, and thousands of Toon fans,   was the greatest, a supreme striker who terrorised the best defenders in the world. The Premier League\u2019s top scorer, he could score with left or right foot and was brilliant with his head. He was also a great team player. Shearer delivered at club and international level. His record was phenomenal over a long period of time.  He also had the perfect temperament. Fiercely competitive, he knew how to play right on the edge and bend the rules. I also loved the fact that he gave up the opportunity to win major medals with other clubs, preferring  . Loyalty is also a key part of being Britain\u2019s greatest footballer."},

Alves, who left Barcelona during the summer and signed for Mexican side UNAM Pumas, has yet to make any official comment. Very soon after the allegation was made, thE footballer swiftly returned to Mexico to join back up with his team. That means that the court may decide to summon him remotely rather than force him to return to Barcelona. The footballer,\u00a0 , wished his fans Happy New Year in a message posted on Instagram early this morning/Sunday morning. He wrote: \u201cHappy 2023 to all.

In 2021/22, Manchester United's No10 mustered just five goals in all competitions and a measly 38 Dream Team points. This term, he's already on 15 club goals and 143 Dream Team points. Game Week 17 was Rashford's best of 2022/23 so far as he took Everton and Charlton for a combined 28 points. He scored one and assisted another as the Red Devils swept aside the Toffees in the FA Cup third round on Friday night, claiming the Star Man award in the process, before he came off the bench to seal his side's win over the Addicks in the Carabao Cup quarter-final with a late brace on Tuesday night. The 25-year-old has scored in six consecutive games since the resumption of the domestic season following the World Cup in Qatar. In fact, he's scored seven goals and provided two assists in his last 426 minutes of action. Since the restart, Rashford has plundered a mighty 61 Dream Team points, more than double that of Erling Haaland (\u00a39m) in the same time frame. Manchester City's prolific No9 has scored four goals in five outings since for a return of 30 points, a great effort, but it just goes to show how rampant Rashford has been over the festive period and into the new year. There are plenty of enticing options up front for Dream Team gaffers to shuffle between right now. Haaland remains a mainstay while Harry Kane (\u00a37.4m) continues on his merry way but Arsenal pair Gabriel Martinelli (\u00a33.5m) and Eddie Nketiah (\u00a32.6m) offer incredible value for money. In-form goalscorers Aleksandar Mitrovic (\u00a35.4m) and Rodrigo (\u00a33.8m) are more than viable too, but despite this stiff competition, Rashford has quickly become a must-have asset. The remainder January brings two tough tests for Man United in the form of neighbours Man City and league leaders Arsenal (plus two more favourable match-ups against Crystal Palace and Reading) but the England international is too hot to ignore, whatever the schedule. Erik ten Hag's side have won eight games in a row in all competitions and have rallied to the point where they will feel confident of competing against the Premier League's current top two - they beat the Gunners in September but were comprehensively outplayed in the last Manchester derby. Both Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta will be wary of Rashford's threat but whether they can nullify him is another matter entirely. Dream Team bosses should be asking themselves if they can afford to go without Old Trafford's homegrown hero - three quarters of gaffers are missing out at the time of writing."},

{"title": "Is it actually time for Dream Team managers to ditch out-of-sorts Joao Cancelo?", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "6 Jan 2023", "content": "JUST the thought alone should send a shiver up the spine of any self-respecting Dream Team manager. But there's no room for sentimentality in this game and so the question must be asked. Is it really time to ditch Joao Cancelo (\u00a36.5m)? At pretty much any other time in the last three years this blasphemous question could be dismissed as the ramblings of a lunatic. The Portuguese full-back has been one of the absolute best Dream Team assets in recent times, finishing among the top two defenders in each of the last two campaigns. His mountainous points tallies have reflected what pundits and fans have observed - he has been instrumental for Manchester City, arguably their next-most important player after Kevin De Bruyne (\u00a37.8m) since 2020. A defender only in theory, Cancelo spends most of his time operating in midfield areas or helping to create overloads out wide. His technical ability, particularly his control in tight spaces and his range of passing, has often been the reason Pep Guardiola's side have unlocked stubborn defences and it's the regularity of his attacking contributions on top of plentiful clean sheets that has made him an elite Dream Team asset. At least that's been the story to date. In fact it was all going swimmingly during the first third of the current season as well. The 28-year-old racked up 97 points by the end of Game Week 12, justifying his lofty price tag. But it's all gone pear shaped of late. Cancelo was sent off against Fulham at the start of November and he incurred minus two points in his first game back from suspension to knock his total down to 92. And that's how he left things when he jetted off to Qatar to represent Portugal at the World Cup. Truth be told, Cancelo looked out of sorts at the tournament and Fernando Santos dropped him from the starting line-up by the knockout stages. He's been used sparingly by Guardiola since the resumption of the domestic season too - he came off the bench midway through the second half against Leeds before being withdrawn at half-time at Stamford Bridge on Thursday night. Having been given just 67 minutes across City's last four fixtures, Cancelo could be considered out of favour and with a fresh batch of transfers to use, 22.1% of Dream Team bosses will seriously be thinking about finding a replacement. One possible candidate is Rico Lewis (\u00a32.7m), the 18-year-old new fan favourite at the Etihad. Guardiola spoke glowingly of the teenage right-back again following City's 1-0 win over Chelsea in west London - Lewis' introduction alongside Manuel Akanji (\u00a33.9m), Jack Grealish (\u00a33.9m) and Riyad Mahrez (\u00a35.2m) helped swing the game in the visitors' favour. The teenage defender costs \u00a33.8m less than Cancelo which would allow for significant upgrades elsewhere. As the old saying goes: form is temporary, class is permanent - Cancelo will come again but for now it may be best to look elsewhere for healthy returns."},

Burst on to the scene as a teenager at Fulham and after some impressive performances as a teenager,  \u00a0splashed \u00a312million on him. He barely got into the City side before a long loan spell at Celtic. Although he won seven trophies under Brendan Rodgers,   had a number of injury issues and did not hit the heights expected of him. Another loan spell to Girona last season didn't really work out - while stints at Norwich and Middlesbrough last term have been uninspiring. Roberts went on loan at Derby, who narrowly avoided relegation to League One with a thrilling 3-3 draw on the final day of the Championship season. Now, he's at League One side Sunderland. One of the players most deserving of the tag, the England and Chelsea star is one of the biggest stars in the women's game. Kirby, who stands at just 5ft 2in, is a former PFA and FWA player of the year and has been a vital player in all of the Lionesses' recent success, including winning the Euros. In 2021, Kirby was voted the 10th best player in the world in the Ballon d'Or list. Gauld was 17 when he made his debut for Dundee United and began tearing it up in Scotland, helping The Terrors reach the Scottish Cup final in 2014. After being shortlisted for Young Player of the Year, Gauld was snapped up by Portuguese giants Sporting Lisbon. But Gauld only made two league appearances for Sporting, all in 2014 and early 2015, and went on four unsuccessful loan spells. He's now at MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps FC, after a spell at Portuguese second tier side Farense. The Messi comparisons are definitely a step too far but Shaqiri - formerly of Liverpool - is quite obviously a talent good enough for most teams in the world. He has played at some of the biggest clubs and scored at two World Cups and the European Championship. Injuries limited his impact at the Reds, and he moved to Lyon before plying his trade in the MLS with Chicago Fire. Speaking of whom, there was a time when   being compared to Messi would have been impossible to imagine... namely at Chelsea. Now thriving at Liverpool, the Egyptian king isn't quite at Messi's level - but he's pretty damn close. This was a tag from when the forward was still at Basel and, in all honesty, it's quite fair. Salah is now one of the best players in the world and will soon have players being dubbed the 'Next Salah'. Certainly has enough natural talent to earn comparisons to one of the best ever. But the winger, now at Udinese following stints at Everton and Watford, does not have the consistency or work rate to compare himself to Messi. Deulofeu struggled in two spells at Barca but was instrumental to the Hornets getting to the FA Cup final in 2019.

Was sent on four loan spells in three seasons and managed just six Premier League games in West London.

Another Barcelona graduate, the diminutive Croatian international has the technique but has struggled with the physicality of senior football. Loan spells at Sporting Gijon have brought little success. He is currently at Croatian club HNK Rijeka, after spells at Championship side Reading and AC Milan, where he failed to play a single Serie A game. Dutch side Heerenveen, Standard Liege, and Birmingham also feature on his CV. One of the most hyped teenagers in Europe, the Norwegian jumped from Stromsgodset to Real Madrid in 2015. He initially struggled to live up to the hype and a two-year loan spell at Heerenveen brought inconsistent play. But last season on loan at Real Sociedad, Odegaard was excellent - putting himself in the frame to break back into the Madrid first-team. The Norwegian signed for Arsenal in a permanent deal in 2021, after a loan spell and his form has fired the Gunners to the top of the Premier League. Definitely a tongue-in-cheek nickname, the winger earned the title while starring for Brentford for five years between 2014 and 2019. Judge helped the Bees reach the Championship and stay in the second tier, and was named in the PFA teams of the year in 2013 and 2016. He was at Ipswich, helping the Tractor Boys to ninth in League One in 2020-21, before signing for Colchester. Actually nicknamed 'Little Messi', the Peruvian scored a mountain of goals in Peru and Mexico before moving to MLS in 2018. The striker has been sensational for the Seattle Sounders, winning the MLS Cup and CONCACAF Champions League. Edon Zhegrova became a YouTube sensation back in 2014 after compilations of the then 15-year old\u2019s dazzling goals gained thousands of views. The Arsenal, PSG and Barcelona moves did not materialise, but a move to Belgium's Standard Liege and then Genk did, where he is coming through the ranks. Basel then decided to take a longer look at him with an 18-month loan deal. The No10 played a handful of games for the club before moving to Lille. The Chennaiyin\u00a0winger became the youngest Indian international when he made his debut in 2015. But, now aged 24, the hype has died down a bit with Chhangte unable to build on that early promise. And he now playing for Indian side Mumbai City. Still just 22, Kubo has the best chance of any player to live up to the moniker. The former FC Tokyo forward even came through the ranks at Barcelona, where he was a youth star, before returning to Japan. He would have stayed at La Masia but after Barca's transfer ban he was no longer eligible to play in competitive matches, so decided to return to his homeland. He is the youngest player to play and score in the J.League and has been a regular in the FC Tokyo side. Kubo was snapped up by Real Madrid, a major coup for Los Blancos - but was quickly loaned to Mallorca before joining Getafe on a short-term deal earlier in 2021. Barcelona had wanted the playmaker - but were fooled into thinking he was not available until next January after an error on the Transkfermarkt website. Real Madrid knew the correct date his contract was up and swooped. Kubo, who has been brilliant in Japan's successful World Cup campaign in Qatar, is currently at Real Sociedad after joining last summer. The little winger never lived up to the moniker after coming through at Olympiacos. Has since played in Italy and Saudi Arabia, but is now at Qatari side Al-Sailiya. A number of European clubs were interested in Azmoun a few years ago, including Arsenal, who offered \u00a32m for the rapid forward. Azmoun starred in Russia for Zenit St Petersburg, where he has scored 62 times in just 104 games while winning three Russian Premier League titles. However, he's now at Bayer Leverkusen - where he has scored just once across two seasons. Aged just 21, Egy is already a full international having been a prodigy at youth level. He had scored 15 goals in 16 matches for Indonesia Under-19s, attracting attention from big clubs in Europe. Eventually, Maulana chose Lechia Gdansk where he also impressed for the reserves, scoring 12 goals in 14 matches in the Polish fourth tier. He made his full debut in 2020 and is now a 17-cap senior international for Indonesia. He moved to Slovenian side FK Senica, and now plays for ViOn Zlat\u00e9 Moravce in the same league. The 22-year-old has the potential to be a big star and has consistently been named as one of the players to keep an eye on in the coming years. The teenager is already a full international for El Tri and was signed by Real Betis for \u00a39m in January 2019. This season, he was sent on loan to Primeira Liga club Braga for much-needed first team experience. Lee was once hailed as South Korea's great hope of the future and was another graduate of Barcelona's famed La Masia academy. He moved to Catalonia in 2011, but managed just one appearance for Barcelona B, before moving to Hellas Verona in 2017. Now 25, the winger plays for South Korean side Suwon FC but became a national hero for his exploits in the Asian Games. Lee provided the assist for Tottenham's Son Heung-min to score a winner - the goal also meant the Spurs man would avoid national service. One of the smallest players in world football, Nasir stands at just 5ft. But there is plenty of talent in those little legs, with the Terengganu FC star scoring on his international debut. Nicknamed 'Little Messi', Okoro spent time in Spain with Almeria but struggled to make a breakthrough. He certainly likes the nickname, however, stating: \"I don\u2019t mind when people call me Little Messi. \"It\u2019s a pleasant thing to be compared with the best footballer in the world - I don\u2019t have a problem with that.\" But having played back in his homeland of Nigeria, Okoro is now without a club. Songkrasin is known as 'Messi Jay'\"or just 'Jay' but actually took inspiration from another Argentine legend. His father apparently trained him with the intention of copying Diego Maradona. He became a fans' favourite across Thailand for his dribbling skills, with 58 international caps so far, and now plays in Japan for Kawasake Frontale. The winger was nicknamed Messi from a young age because of his dribbling skills. He even managed a two week trial at Barcelona but failed to make the grade - Tlolane is now back in South Africa with Orlando Pirates."},

And the post went on to become the  , overtaking the egg and gathering nearly 75million likes. In another snap, Angel Di Maria can be seen noticing that the trophy is a fake by looking at the bottom of it. According to  , Argentina fans Manuel and Paula had the cup made before the tournament, with the sole purpose of trying to get players to sign it. Explaining what happened, they said: \"The idea was that the players could sign it, but in the end the Cup entered the field of play three times. \"The first one was taken by a relative of (Leandro) Paredes, and he signed it. \"The second time they asked us for it and it was 45 minutes, it went from one player to another, from one family member to another, and they took photos. \"In the stands they told me 'you lost the Cup'. We had fun but we wanted him back. \"There I yelled at a couple of players 'if you see the Cup that Paredes has, it's ours', and in the end Lautaro Mart\u00ednez brought it, who also signed it. \"Fifa personnel came there and asked us to confirm that it was not the original.\" Among those to hold the trophy thinking it was real was Messi's wife Antonela. When Di Maria eventually pointed out to Messi that it was fake, the duo laughed together - showing no signs of irritation. Photographer Fernando de la Orden captured many of the snaps - and even went to visit Manuel and Paula once back in Argentina - where the fake trophy resides today. During the encounter, Manuel and Paula revealed: \"Before the World Cup we contacted people who are dedicated to making cups and it took them six months to make it. \"It has the weight of the original, it is made with resin and quartz inside and bathed with a gold-like paint. \"There are some details, marks and reliefs that are not similar, but the difference is minimal.\" Messi, 35, spent more than a fortnight celebrating his win back in Argentina -   attended by some of his team-mates. He has now returned to PSG, however, touching down in France yesterday. The superstar is unlikely to feature in their Coupe de France clash with third-tier Chateauroux on Friday night, but could return against Ligue 1's bottom side Angers next Wednesday."},

Berhalter claimed he was blackmailed during the 2022 Qatar  - and has been forced to go public about kicking his wife in 1991. In a lengthy statement posted on his Twitter profile, the manager revealed a violent incident in 1991 involving his wife Rosalind and admitted to \"kicking her in the legs\". The post read: \"While we obviously would have wanted to advance further in the World Cup, I am very proud of and grateful for all our players, our staff, everyone at US Soccer, and all of the USMNT fans worldwide who supported us. \"Our performance relied on hard work and extraordinary energy and commitment from those on and off the pitch during the years of preparation. \"There are so many positive examples of how our squad came together, making so many different types of sacrifices all in pursuit of our group's shared vision. \"I am looking forward to continuing my conversations with US Soccer about the future, but now is the time for me to publicly share some personal information which a third party has used against my family and me.\" Berhalter continued: \"During the World Cup, an individual contacted US Soccer, saying that they had information about me that would \"take me down\" - an apparent effort to leverage something very personal from long ago to bring about the end of my relationship with US Soccer. \"This is a difficult step to take, but my wife, Rosalind, and I want to clearly and directly share the truth. This is a story that belongs to us, but hopefully there are lessons from our relationship that can be valuable to others. \"In the fall of 1991, I met my soulmate. I had just turned 18 and was a freshman in college when I met Rosalind for the first time. \"There was a familiar feeling when we spoke. Rosalind was and is an amazing person - determined, empathetic, fun to be around - and we connected immediately. \"It felt like we had known each other for years. We had been dating for four months when an incident happened between us that would shape the future of our relationship. \"One night, while out drinking at a local bar, Rosalind and I had a heated argument that continued outside. It became physical and I kicked her in the legs. \"There are zero excuses for my actions that night; it was a shameful moment and one that I regret to this day. \"At that time, I immediately apologized to Rosalind, but understandably, she wanted nothing to do with me. I told my parents, family, and friends what happened because I wanted to take full responsibility for my behavior. \"Rosalind also informed her parents, family, and friends. While the authorities were never involved in this matter, I voluntarily sought out counseling to help learn, grow and improve - one of the most valuable decisions that ever made. \"To this day, that type of behavior has never been repeated.\" During the World Cup, an individual contacted US Soccer, saying that they had information about me that would \"take me down\" - an apparent effort to leverage something very personal from long ago to bring about the end of my relationship with US Soccer.

They both played football together and were a couple for six years before getting married in 1999 while now having four children together. Berhalter's post furthered: \"I feared that I lost my soulmate and then out of the blue, seven months later I received a call from Rosalind asking if we could speak in person. \"We met and discussed how we had grown and decided to rebuild our relationship. \"Rosalind shared that her family supported this decision and by working through what had happened, we both realized that our love, trust, and respect for each other was stronger than the incident that occurred months earlier. \"Since then, Rosalind and I have lived together in five different countries, three different states and have met and remained friends with many wonderful people from around the world.

'THIS IS OUR STORY'  \"I am sharing this story after 31 years because it's important to understand it was an event that shaped me, but doesn't define me. \"It was a single, isolated event over three decades ago and a terrible decision made in a bad moment by an 18-year-old.

We are very proud of our marriage, our relationship, the family we have built, and the people we have become. \"As a team we emphasize accountability, honesty, and growth. Those aren't just principles we instill within the team; it is how I live my life. The foundation of any good team is using the past as an opportunity to learn and get better. \"People can make mistakes and learn from them; people can also be forgiven for their mistakes. Thankfully, Rosalind forgave me. \"The intention of this statement is to provide transparency and to reinforce that a single bad decision made by a teenager does not necessarily define him for the rest of his life. We will not hide from this. We didn't then, and we won't now. \"This is our story. We have fully cooperated with the US Soccer investigation into this matter, and while we would prefer not to speak about something so personal from so long ago in such a public forum, we are embracing this opportunity to share what has shaped us and how much we have grown and learned from this over the past 31 years.

I\u2019m not criticizing Earnie here. \u201cI very much commend the recent efforts by U.S. Soccer to address abuse of women players, and I understand now he had an obligation to investigate what I shared.  \"But I want to be very clear that I did not ask for Gregg to be fired, I did not make any threats, and I don\u2019t know anything about any blackmail attempts, nor have I ever had any discussions about anyone else on Gregg\u2019s staff\u2014I don\u2019t know any of the other coaches.

I had just turned 18 and was a freshman in college when I met Rosalind. \"One night, while out drinking at a local bar, Rosalind and I had a heated argument that continued outside. It became physical and I kicked her in the legs.\" Berhalter added: \"The lessons learned from that night over three decades ago became the foundation for a loving, devoted, and supportive relationship, which we honored and celebrated with our 25th wedding anniversary this past weekend\" Berhalter's contract with the US expired on December 31, 2022, following the round of 16 knockout at the hands of Holland.

{"title": "Alexis Mac Allister transfer \u2013 next club odds: Chelsea favourites to sign World Cup star, Tottenham tipped to challenge", "author": "James Anderson", "date": "18 Jan 2023", "content": "CHELSEA are frontrunners to sign Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister. That's according to Sky Bet, who've installed the London heavyweights as 9-1 favourites to clinch his signature. But there's no shortage of top contenders sniffing around with Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid expected to challenge. Tottenham also feature in Sky Bet's next club market, along with La Liga outfit Atletico Madrid. Mac Allister arrived at Brighton from Argentinos Juniors for just \u00a37million in 2019. He's since made 89 appearances for the club, scoring 15 goals and providing six assists in all competitions. Though a quality performer, Mac Allister really sprung to stardom when helping Argentina to the ultimate prize at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The 24-year-old played in six consecutive games after being left out of their opening defeat to Saudi Arabia, scoring once against Poland. His performances for club and country has led to increased speculation about his future, despite having over two years remaining on his contract. Sky Bet odds His deal expires in June 2025 and Brighton have the option to extend that deal by a further 12 months -- putting them in the driving seat in any potential negotiations. But the Seagulls aren't eager to let him leave. The club's chief executive Paul Barber recently said: \"He will be sought after, we're very aware of that, but we hope to keep him here as long as we can.\" Brighton's recent departures have included Marc Cucurella, Yves Bissouma and Neal Maupay for a combined \u00a3100million. Ben White left in June 2021 for \u00a350m, while fellow defender Dan Burn moved to Newcastle in January 2022 for \u00a313m. If Mac Allister is to join that list, Sky Bet think Chelsea and a reunion with former boss Graham Potter is the most likely scenario. The Blues have spent BIG under Todd Boehly, and strengthening their ageing midfield is now considered to be a top priority. Juventus, PSG and Tottenham are locked together at 12-1, ahead of 16-1 shots Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.

It isn't known what caused the stampede, but horror footage shared on social media shows tightly-packed crowds being funnelled towards the entrances of the Basra International Stadium by security. Thousands of excited supporters had gathered outside the stadium some nine hours before kickoff, due to take place at 4pm GMT. Iraqi authorities claim more than 500,000 fans arrived in Basra - population 1.3 million - in the past day leading up to the final. A medic said: \"There has been one death and dozens of slight injuries.\" Regional news site Arab News has reported that there have been calls to postpone the final due to the horror scenes. The Iraqi prime minister has arrived in Basra and held a meeting with regional leaders after the stampede to assess the situation. Basra's governor says negotiations are underway with the Gulf Cup Federation over how to ensure security at the stadium. An Iraqi TV commentator has said the game will still go ahead, and that the stadium gates will open two hours before kick-off to allow supporters to enter. It is the first time the Middle Eastern country has hosted the regional   tournament in 40 years due to decades of political instability. The two-week tournament sees eight Middle Eastern countries compete in two groups of four before the top two teams in each group advance to the semi-finals. Iraq beat recent World Cup hosts Qatar 2-1 in Monday's semi-final to set up a hotly-anticipated final with Oman. Other countries taking part included Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Yemen. The tournament also comes on the 20th anniversary of the British and American invasion of Iraq.

And the 28-year-old Belgian World Cup star is set to undergo a medical after agreeing personal terms with the Premier League leaders. Gunners boss   has moved quickly to reinforce his squad after months of negotiations for Mudryk were wrecked by   for the Shakhtar Donetsk winger. And he is convinced that  can be a cut-price alternative to help his title contenders over the line. Official talks with   were only opened this week but progressed rapidly when it became clear that the south coast club were ready to sell this season\u2019s seven-goal top scorer. Trossard only had six months of Amex contract to run and although Brighton had the option to extend that deal for a further 12 months, they decided to cash in on a player who had fallen out with new boss Roberto De Zerbi. And while   initial bid of \u00a320m was rebuffed, they came straight back with an improved offer which matched Brighton\u2019s valuation. It is understood that Arsenal are paying a guaranteed \u00a321m plus a further \u00a36m in easily achievable bonus payments which include Champions League qualification. The swift conclusion of the deal was promoted by Arsenal\u2019s determination to get the signing over the line before any of their Premier League rivals could come in with a counter offer. And having already been gazumped by Chelsea over Mudryk, they were aware of   and did not want to leave the door open by needlessly dragging out the negotiations. The move represents a fresh start for Trossard, who cost Brighton \u00a319m when they signed him from Belgian club Genk in 2019. Although he played in every game for Belgium at the recent World Cup finals in Qatar, he quickly found himself out of favour on his return to the Amex and was left out of the squad for their last two games. De Zerbi blamed Trossard's poor attitude for his omission and claimed the player had stormed out of training when he discovered that he would not be in the starting line-up for the recent FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough. Trossard denied that suggestion and claimed the incident was a misunderstanding after he had suffered an injury. But now they have agreed to a parting of ways after Trossard scored 26 Premier League goals and contributed 15 assists during his four seasons at the Amex. And though he is older than any of the players Arsenal have signed in the previous four transfer windows, Arteta is convinced he will be an ideal short-term solution. His ability to play on either the left or right wing as well as through the centre gives Arsenal the opportunity to give a well earned breather to Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli while also covering for  . And the fact that Trossard is already acclimatised to the Premier League and can go straight into first team contention means he could even be involved in next week\u2019s FA Cup fourth round tie at Manchester City."},

Andrey Santos will be in action later this week in the South American Under-20 Championships, which kick off in Colombia on Thursday.\u00a0  Usually held every two years, the 2021 version was called off because of the pandemic.\u00a0  The reigning champions, from the 2019 version are Ecuador, who went on to come third in that year\u2019s World Cup at the level, producing a number of players for the senior World Cup squad in Qatar. That Ecuador squad in 2019 was full of players from Independiente del Valle - and so is this one four years later.\u00a0  The club have a remarkable recent record of producing talent, and European scouts are paying plenty of attention.\u00a0  And now that Caicedo has proved such a success, then the transfer fees are likely to be higher.\u00a0  The risk factor of coming straight out of Ecuador has been reduced.\u00a0  If there is a Moises Caicedo on show, interested clubs will surely have to go much higher than \u00a35 million."},
{"title": "Declan Rice is guaranteed to leave West Ham\u2026 and Arsenal and Man Utd are his most logical transfer destinations", "author": "Mark Irwin", "date": "19 Jan 2023", "content": "DECLAN RICE has a massive decision to make this summer \u2014 and it does not involve \u00a0staying at West Ham. Every team in Europe is keen to sign the future England captain at the end of the season, although very few can afford him. But even the handful of clubs who can meet the Hammers' demands will present a dilemma for   as he \u00a0considers all his options. Because how do you choose when you have got  ,  , Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester City all queueing at your door? The fact that   still have an option to extend his contract to 2025 is immaterial. Whether they stay in the   or not, they know their best player is\u00a0leaving. Rice virtually confirmed that last month when he said that he is \u00a0desperate to play in the Champions League. Because that ain\u2019t going to happen at West Ham any time in the foreseeable future. That\u2019s why he has already rejected an offer of a new EIGHT-YEAR contract from the club who would happily make him their highest paid player in the blink of an eye. There are about a dozen players at the London Stadium currently earning more than Rice, including left-back Emerson Palmieri, Ivory Coast winger Max Cornet and reserve keeper Alphonse Areola. But that\u2019s often the case with players who have graduated through the academy rather than signing on big money from another club. Yet it\u2019s not about the money for Rice. It\u2019s about competing at the very highest level and squeezing every last drop from his career. He will have seen how his 29-year-old England team-mate Harry Kane \u2014 who signed for Tottenham way back in 2011 \u2014 is still waiting to win his first major trophy at the club after committing himself to a lucrative long-term contract five years ago. And he is not going to make the same mistake with West Ham. He will also have noted how his pal Jack Grealish, 27, gave up being a big fish in a small pond at Aston Villa to win the Premier League in his very first season with Manchester City. So now it is simply a question of which club can offer him the best opportunity to maximise his talent \u00a0during the peak years of his career. Having just turned 24, he has the potential to become one of the best defensive midfield players in the world over the next decade. It was only last April that David Moyes said that West Ham would not consider selling their captain for less than \u00a3150million. But now the consensus is that he could go for little more than half that amount, particularly if the Hammers are relegated to the Championship. Yet with so many serious clubs \u00a0wanting his services, there\u2019s plenty of potential for a bidding war taking that fee to British record levels. Chelsea, despite having released Rice from their academy at 14, would have no shame in breaking the bank to bring him back. But, like Liverpool, there\u2019s every chance that they won\u2019t be able to offer him Champions League football next season, even though the two are the last English clubs to win it. City only play with one holding midfielder and already have Rodri and Kalvin Phillips on their books. Newcastle are clearly an emerging force and have the resources to outbid anyone if they can secure a top-four finish this season. But it\u2019s Arsenal or Erik ten Hag\u2019s United who offer the most logical career path for Rice and, with both clubs apparently on the up, it could be a straight shootout between the resurgent giants this summer. Either way, West Ham fans should make the most of their best player while they still can. MANCHESTER UNITED fans are understandably excited by the news that \u2018Britain\u2019s richest man\u2019 is trying to buy the club from the Glazers. The fact that Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been living abroad as a tax exile is not going to curb their enthusiasm. Yet financial experts have calculated his personal fortune at \u00a36billion \u2014 and the Glazers want at least \u00a35bn. That does not leave a lot of spare cash for someone who clearly hates the idea of frittering his money on such avoidable expenses as income tax. And after he lost out in the bidding for Chelsea last spring, United should not hold their breath waiting for the takeover. CHELSEA manager Graham Potter says they cannot keep trying to spend their way out of trouble or else they will end up with a 30-man squad. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Graham, but the matchday programme for last week\u2019s game against Crystal Palace already listed 33 Blues players. And that did not even include the club\u2019s \u00a388million new-boy Mykhailo Mudryk. Potter joked he hopes he is still in a job when Mudryk\u2019s remarkable new contract finally expires in 8\u00bd years. Good luck with that. Me? I just hope I am still alive in 2031. BRITAIN\u2019S top referees have been tying themselves in knots trying to justify Manchester United\u2019s equaliser against neighbours City last week. But they\u2019re defending the indefensible because anyone who knows anything about football could see Marcus Rashford was offside and the goal should never have stood. And if the laws of the game say differently because he wasn\u2019t interfering with play, then the law is an ass. SPURS are threatening to issue a lifetime ban to the supporter who kicked Aaron Ramsdale during Sunday\u2019s 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal. More than 500 season ticket holders have already claimed responsibility. FIFA have claimed five billion people \u2018engaged\u2019 with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. What does that even mean? But then very little coming out of world football\u2019s governing body makes sense any more. According to reports, TV companies covering the winter finals were ordered to show at least one shot of Fifa president Gianni Infantino at every match. But they weren\u2019t allowed to film him on his phone, nor below knee height when he was sitting next to any of his dodgy dictator mates in the plush stadiums out in the desert. Come back Sepp Blatter, all is (almost) forgiven. A MOVE to rename the Severn Bridge the Gareth Bale Bridge has been KO\u2019d by a House of Lords committee. Presumably they were worried the bridge \u2014 which connects England and Wales \u2014 would be out of action for nine months every year. TENNIS star Emma Raducanu has defended her commitment to the sport by declaring: \u201cI give 200 per cent in everything I do.\u201d That probably explains why the British ace, 20, has suffered so many injuries \u2014 she\u2019s been trying to do the impossible. ICE skater Kamila Valieva has been cleared by the Russian anti-doping agency \u2014 despite her positive test before last year\u2019s Winter Olympics. They announced that although the 16-year-old had taken banned heart medication, she bore \u2018no fault or negligence\u2019 for the offence. And who could possibly doubt the word of such a trusted organisation?"},

{"title": "Man Utd ace told me he would be a star when he was just 12\u2026 it turned out he was right", "author": "Troy Deeney", "date": "10 Feb 2023", "content": "ABOUT a decade ago, I got a message from a young kid on Instagram. It read something like: \u201cHi there, Troy, my name\u2019s Jadon, I\u2019m 12 years old, I\u2019m in the   academy, look out for me!\u201d I didn\u2019t notice this at the time but many years later, it popped up again on my feed. That\u2019s because the kid in question \u2014   \u2014 had become very famous. In fact, he\u2019s now got nine million followers. He was right, I should have looked out for him. And since I\u2019ve been doing my coaching badges, some of the coaches in the Watford academy have told me how special they knew Jadon was. They have described him as a generational talent, the sort of kid you will only discover once every 10 years if you\u2019re lucky. There was something about the way he could manipulate a football, his pace, directness and confidence. For them, it wasn\u2019t a case of whether he would be successful but just how soon he would burst onto the scene. I never met Jadon when he was at Watford. By the time he was 14, he had moved to Manchester City\u2019s academy. \n By 17, he\u2019d turned down a contract at   and moved to  , where he lit up the Bundesliga. Moving abroad at such a young age was a bold move but it was a triumph for him. Apart from his goals and assists for Dortmund, I recall him displaying a \"Justice for George Floyd\" T-shirt soon after the Bundesliga\u2019s post-Covid restart. That was bold too. He knows who he is and he knows he has a strong voice. At 18, he was a senior   international and at 21, he was a \u00a373million signing for  . His career trajectory was extraordinary up until that point so there should have been little surprise that he would suffer some sort of blip. Anyone who tells you their career has been one straight upward line, is a liar. You learn more from the hard times than the good times. Jadon arrived at Old Trafford soon after he had missed a penalty in the Euros final against Italy. Along with   and  , Sancho suffered horrific racial abuse online after that shootout defeat. After that ordeal, Saka showed instant improvement \u2014 he has come on in leaps and bounds at  . Rashford took a while, partly due to injury, but in the past few months, he has been absolutely magnificent. Both Saka and Rashford impressed at the World Cup but Sancho wasn\u2019t even close to making the plane to Qatar. During the World Cup break, boss   stated publicly that Jadon was not in the right physical or mental state to play for United. It was surprising to many people that Ten Hag spoke so openly about that but I do think people are more enlightened and accepting than they used to be about discussing mental health. Jadon has had a tough year, going to United as a big-money signing and adapting to the Premier League was difficult. And I\u2019m convinced that Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s sudden arrival didn\u2019t help him, either. I can remember a few occasions when   showed his displeasure at Sancho on the pitch and that won\u2019t have helped. We all know Ronaldo has an ego and Sancho\u2019s game doesn\u2019t really dovetail with Ronaldo\u2019s. Sancho is a right-footer who usually plays on the left, loves to cut inside and look to shoot himself and that didn\u2019t always go down well with Ronaldo. So after all the issues Sancho has had it was great to see him make such an impact against Leeds on Wednesday night. He came off the bench with his team 2-0 down at Old Trafford and playing a major part in their comeback to earn a draw, including  . With Antony injured and Alejandro Garnacho struggling the other night, it\u2019s quite likely Sancho will start in the return match at Elland Road tomorrow. That would be a great test for him and one he should relish. I always loved playing at Elland Road, a proper old-school ground with a great atmosphere and the crowd right on top of you. And with the fierce rivalry between Leeds and Manchester United, that will be even more pronounced. My Dad was a Leeds fan. I grew up watching the likes of Brian Deane and Tony Yeboah. I often scored there \u2014 including an amazing top-bins own-goal while trying to defend a corner against Leeds while playing for Walsall in League One! But usually I scored at the right end. It always felt like my old man was looking down at me. If Jadon can impress there tomorrow, like he did on Wednesday, it would do his confidence the world of good. Like most footballers \u2014 and certainly wingers \u2014 Sancho is a confidence player. He certainly wasn\u2019t lacking confidence when he called me out on social media at the age of 12. I\u2019m convinced he will be back playing regularly at elite level soon. He is a special player."},

{"title": "Jobe Bellingham, 17, has significant advantage over England star brother Jude even though his career has stalled", "author": "Graeme Bryce", "date": "14 Feb 2023", "content": "It's the high-octane environment the 19-year-old   midfielder was always destined for. Unfortunately, for Bellingham MkII, his younger brother  , life is currently the pits - which is where he finds himself right now. The 17-year-old's career has been temporarily stalled by injury, which has forced him off track as  's medical team carry out running repairs on the strained stomach muscle he suffered in training back in January. Since then Bellingham Junior has been sidelined for six weeks, ruling him out of the   side's last seven games, with weeks of hard rehab still ahead of him. It's the first bump in the road for Jobe, an England international at Under-16, U17 and U18 level. But Birmingham boss John Eustace is confident the midfielder will handle the pressure as he looks to carve out his own pathway in the pro game. He said: \u201cJobe is a fantastic young player. Until now his development has been excellent and he's made 18 senior appearances in the last year. But overall, we feel Jobe is doing very, very well.\" There has been a buzz about the Bellingham brothers since foreign scouts started flocking to Birmingham City's Wast Hills Training Ground - long before Jude beat Trevor Francis's record to become the Blues' youngest debutant aged 16 years 38 days. Such was Bellingham's prodigious, precocious talent, Birmingham retired his No.22 shirt when he left for Dortmund for a club record \u00a325million, to become the most expensive 17-year-old in the history of the game.\u00a0 Fortunately for the cash-strapped Blues - like London buses - you wait forever for one to arrive and then two come along at once. By the time Jude was saying 'Auf Wiedersehen,' to St Andrew's his younger brother Jobe, just 15 at the time, was included in City's official photo-shoot promoting their new kit for the 2020-21 season. Jobe, who is more attack-minded than Jude, was named on the subs' bench for Blues' EFL Cup tie at home to Colchester United last August. But former Blues boss Lee Bowyer didn't need to call on him that evening and Jobe narrowly missed the opportunity to nip in ahead of his big brother as Birmingham's youngest ever debutant. However he did make his senior debut as a second-half sub against Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup last year to become Blues' second youngest debutant, aged 16 years and 107 days. Since then, he has gone on to sign his first pro deal when he turned 17 in September and he has now made 18 appearances in all competitions for Blues. He has been carefully nurtured and 13 of those appearances have come from the bench as he clocked up 188 minutes of total playing time. The last thing Jobe needs is the pressure of being compared to one of Europe's most coveted players, who made his mark at the World Cup in Qatar. Fortunately his future is in safe hands at a club who now have experience of how to keep expectation levels in check at such a fragile stage of a young pro's career. Birmingham handled Jude's progress expertly, and they are determined to protect Jobe in the same way, carefully monitoring and limiting media requests to interview him. They are acutely aware of the fact that Jude is a one-off and Jobe has his own career to carve out without the pressure of being constantly compared to his world-famous big bruv. Fortunately, proud dad Mark Bellingham - a former non-league player who scored more than 700 goals in his day - knows the score. He has expertly managed to keep his talented boys grounded and has no intention of letting the hype around Jude affect Jobe's development. Eustace believes Jobe has one significant advantage over Jude - the fact Birmingham's highly productive Academy is turning out a new generation of equally talented youngsters. Where Jude was a one-off who has lived in the full glare of the media spotlight since he was a kid, Jobe has a peer group of fellow Academy graduates also making their mark on Blues' first team. Blues boss Eustace believes it's healthier to compare Jobe's progress with them - rather than his world-famous Champions' League playing bro. He said: \u00a0\"We have to balance where Jobe is with Jordan James, George Hall, Alfie Chang, who all need vital minutes with the first team. \"It\u2019s not like we have just got one or two young players in the group, we have got a lot of young players coming through.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s vitally important they develop at the right stage and I think Jobe is doing that extremely well.\""},
{"title": "FIFA 23 Team of the Year: Twelfth Man and Honourable Mentions predictions", "author": "Georgina Young", "date": "19 Jan 2023", "content": "NOT everyone can get a place on FIFA 23\u2019s Team of the Year, but there\u2019s plenty of space for Honourable Mentions. While there are only 11 spaces in TOTY, there are 15 up for grabs in Honourable Mentions, including FIFA 23\u2019s coveted Twelfth Man. We already released our   in TOTY which will be announced tomorrow. Here\u2019s who we think won\u2019t quite make the top cut, but will be included in  \u2019s Honourable Mentions. As the World Cup winner, and winner of the Golden Glove, Mart\u00ednez has more than proved his worth this year. He\u2019s been playing exceptionally well for Aston Villa too, and we think he will be the runner-up goalkeeper for  . If not Mart\u00ednez, then Milan\u2019s Mike Maignan could take home the promo card. Marquinhos had a good World Cup run until Brazil\u2019s unexpected defeat against Croatia. However, he is still one of the most consistent defenders in Europe, as shown by his place on PSG. His consistency means that he will always deserve a place in Honourable Mentions, if not TOTY. Silva\u2019s performance has only improved over time, despite being dropped by PSG after a disastrous Champions League final. However, just a year later, he proved his worth by helping Chelsea reach the top. Despite his age, he\u2019s still one of the best defenders out there, and may see more victories in his time on the pitch. Despite an excellent season, Tomori was overlooked for England\u2019s World Cup squad. We think FIFA 23 players will be more discerning, and he\u2019ll be picked up for an Honourable Mention. He\u2019s one of Milan\u2019s best all-round players, and helped them reach the top of Serie A. Cancelo not only does an excellent job as a defender, but he is also Man City\u2019s ace up their sleeve. Despite his position, he has the stamina to push forward and put pressure on the opposition\u2019s defence. If he doesn\u2019t make TOTY, he will certainly receive an Honourable Mention. Davies has seen a dip in performance lately, but the Canadian had a pretty good World Cup run. Despite recent standings, he\u2019s still one of the best players for his position, and we think he\u2019ll receive an Honourable Mention. Jude Bellingham has been rising through the ranks over the last few years, and he had a great World Cup. With his mixture of physique and technique, he consistently delivers for his team. He could quite possibly appear on TOTY, but if not he\u2019ll get an Honourable Mention. While Valverde couldn\u2019t help Uruguay during the World Cup his season has been extraordinary. He\u2019s helping Real Madrid go from strength to strength, and you\u2019ll rarely see him on the bench. Valverde is an engine in the midfield and makes a huge impact on each match. Arsenal is leading the Premier League by a long margin, and \u00d8degaard as captain is a big part of that success. When it comes to each match, he has great vision and composure for his team. He won the last Player of the Month vote, and is likely to win a part in TOTY too. Next up for Arsenal, Saka is one of the best wingers in the whole of Europe. We think this will have been noted by the players of FIFA 23, and we considered him for the TOTY. If he doesn\u2019t make it, he\u2019ll certainly win an Honourable Mention. Le\u00e3o is one of the best wingers around at the moment, though he\u2019s been placed as a forward in the TOTY vote. This is why we don\u2019t think he\u2019ll make TOTY against Mbapp\u00e9 and Messi. However, he has had a spectacular season with Milan, and we think he will do well. Neymar has done well with PSG and was one of the rockstars at the World Cup at Qatar. While we don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do as well as his fellow strikers, he\u2019ll still be high on the list. He might still make a spot on TOTY, but he\u2019ll definitely be at least on the Honourable Mentions. Real Madrid was never expected to win the last Champions League, but Vinicius was a big part of their success. He was consistently taking advantage of Benzema\u2019s assists to take the club to victory. Real Madrid is another team with a strong attacking end, and Vinicius is a big part of that. It took a while for Lewandowski to become comfortable at Barcelona after he made the shocking decision to transfer from Bayern Munich. After a few matches, he was scoring goals with the best of them, which is the Lewandowski we\u2019ve come to know and love. We struggled to decide between Haaland and Benzema for the last striker slot, but Haaland pipped it due to his domination this season. We predict that either Haaland or Benzema will win a place on TOTY, and the other will be our Twelfth Man. Benzema won the last Ballon d\u2019Or, and he\u2019s right to be recognised.

A number of parties have expressed an interest in buying United, which could be purchased for a world-record price for a sports franchise at close to, or above, \u00a36billion.

But according to the  , a Qatar-based investment group will bid for Man Utd. The report states that \"a group of private, high-wealth individuals based in the oil-rich state, buoyed by Qatar\u2019s hosting of the World Cup, have set their sights on\" the Old Trafford club. An offer is expected to be made in the coming days ahead of the mid-February deadline set by the Glazers.  The investment group are said to be confident that their bid blow any competition out of the water, and want to significantly boost manager Erik ten Hag's transfer kitty. As well as coughing up more than \u00a36bn for the club, the Qatari group could face a project of redeveloping, or knocking down Old Trafford and building a new state-of-the-art facility. That could cost north of \u00a32bn - but that would not be a problem. The Qataris are also putting fan engagement at the heart of their takeover bid.

However, a stumbling block that could block a takeover is Qatar Sports Investments' ownership of European juggernaut, Paris Saint-Germain. One entity cannot own two clubs in the same competition \u2014 and United and PSG could meet in Europe. The bid for United would come from separate, individual Qatari investors and there is ZERO interest in taking a partial stake - something the Glazers have been interested in. There are no restrictions on an owner acquiring multiple clubs at the same time in different countries. That means the Qatari group could bid for Manchester United even if they already own\u00a0 However, other rules apply to certain leagues where potential buyers of clubs do have restrictions.

Therefore, if a Qatari group owned\u00a0 \u00a0while they and PSG qualify for the Champions League, the ownership group would more than likely have to choose who plays in it. These rules have been put in to place to protect the integrity of the competition. . A source is quoted as saying: \"There are significant funds available. \"These people are serious. They want to make sure that United are where they should be and they are confident theirs will be the strongest bid. \"They want to strengthen the squad to put them back at the top but they also want this to be for the good of the community. \"They also want to build on the success of the World Cup. \"They recognise that Manchester United is the biggest football club in the world, the crown jewels, and there is a steely-minded determination to buy it and get it to where it should be.\" A successful bid would enhance United's rivalry with Manchester City, who are under ownership based in fierce Gulf neighbours, Abu Dhabi.

{"title": "Three new signings can completely transform Chelsea\u2019s feeble attack under Potter with Fernandez, Madueke and Mudryk", "author": null, "date": "2 Feb 2023", "content": "HAVING bought the club off of Roman Abramovich last May, American businessman Todd Boehly now has two transfer windows under his belt at Stamford Bridge. The Blues have enjoyed football\u2019s greatest riches over the past two decades during the Abramovich era and so   had gargantuan shoes to fill. But the American hasn\u2019t messed around, spending more money than any other club in the history of the January market, splashing out \u00a3326 million to sign eight new players, including   as well as  The signings have been astonishing with others arriving including Joao Felix, Noni Madueke, Malo Gusto, Benoit Badiashile, Andrey Santos and David Fofana. But can these players flip   fortunes on their head this season? Having been linked with   during his time with River Plate, Enzo Fernandez made a smart decision to sign for   as a stepping stone to one of Europe\u2019s top five leagues. The Argentine star was guaranteed playing time under German coach Roger Schmidt which meant that he would likely receive a call-up to the Argentina national team for the World Cup in Qatar. This is exactly how things worked out.  Fernandez not only received a call-up to Lionel Scaloni\u2019s side but played a key role in helping his country Fernandez is now the  , breaking the \u00a3100million fee   in 2021. While the price tag may weigh heavily on his shoulders, Fernandez is still an astute signing for the Blues and a player who was desperately needed at Stamford Bridge. Jorginho has been one of the best midfielders in the Premier League since joining Chelsea in 2018 from Napoli. The Italian was the key man for Chelsea to break opposition lines and to dictate the tempo of their game in the middle of the park. The 31-year-old has been moved on to rivals Arsenal, but his replacement is sharper, more mobile and has a much higher ceiling. Fernandez\u2019s role at Chelsea under   will not involve him being a marauding central midfielder or a box-to-box player but to simply keep things ticking, looking to move the ball around from side to side with his centre-backs. The former River Plate youth product will be important to help Chelsea move the opposition in order to find gaps in their defensive block. As   famously once said: \u201cWe do not pass to move the ball, we pass to move the opposition.\u201d Having a player like Fernandez will be so important for Chelsea to move the ball well around the back and midfield as he is excellent when receiving under pressure and is superb at switching the play from side to side. The reason this is so vital is because the opposition will shift their defensive block from side to side as well in correlation with the movement of the ball in order to defend the ball-side. However, it is extremely difficult to do this consistently without gaps opening up in the block and so this is where Fernandez\u2019s ability will shine through. Chelsea\u2019s new signing will be the player tasked with breaking the lines of the opposition to play to higher areas of the pitch when these spaces do open up in the opponent\u2019s defensive block. Having a mobile deep-lying playmaker capable of playing between the lines is something that all top sides must possess in order to play a possession-based style of football. Liverpool have Thiago, Arsenal have Thomas Partey with Jorginho as a rotation option, Manchester City have Rodri, Manchester United have Christian Eriksen and new signing Marcel Sabitzer, Newcastle United have Bruno Guimaraes, and now Chelsea have Enzo Fernandez. Potter will be hoping that Fernandez\u2019s impact on the team is instant as the Blues don\u2019t possess any other player capable of fulfilling this role.  joined Chelsea for \u00a388million on a lucrative eight-and-a-half year deal from Ukrainian giants Shakhtar Donetsk. His debut cameo against Liverpool was certainly promising as Mudryk attempted more dribbles than any other player on the pitch despite coming on for merely 35 minutes. The Ukrainian will be a menacing player in the final third for Chelsea due to his ability to dribble past opponents at ease. Mudryk has a low centre of gravity and can go either way against an onrushing defender which has become more and more important in the modern game for a winger. This means that the 22-year-old is capable of dribbling inside as well as outside, making it extremely difficult for defenders to predict his movement when squaring him up. A primary method of dribbling that Mudryk uses is cutting inside before dropping his shoulder and pushing the ball in the opposite direction to fool the defender. On his  , Mudryk completed three successful dribbles into the penalty area which averaged out at around one every ten minutes. Furthermore, over the course of the 2022/23 campaign for Shakhtar, the man dubbed \"the Ukrainian Neymar\" completed 70 carries into the box in just half a season. Nonetheless, Mudryk has also proven himself to be a threat in the opposition\u2019s penalty area.  In all competitions for club and country this season, Mudryk averaged 0.52 goals per game which is one every two matches. This is an exceptional record for a winger whose primary function is assisting others as opposed to putting the ball in the net themselves. These added goals can only be beneficial for Chelsea who have massively struggled in front of goal this season, having scored 29 times despite having an xG of 38.74 in all competitions. Even from his debut, the signs were clear that Mudryk will be chipping in with goals in the latter half of the season for the Blues as the new signing found himself in some excellent goalscoring positions. Another player who can potentially change the club\u2019s fortunes is  . Having worked with Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy at Jong PSV and with the PSV Eindhoven first-team this season, Madueke\u2019s game has been elevated to a different level. While new Liverpool signing Cody Gakpo took all the plaudits with the Dutch giants for his outrageous performances, Madueke was quietly going about his business, improving more and more with each passing game. Madueke is the perfect man to add something different to Potter\u2019s frontline, being a left-footer who primarily operates as a right-winger. With Mudryk playing as a right-footer on the left and Madueke on the right, it is clear that the former Brighton coach is looking for something similar to Liverpool\u2019s frontline, with more goal-minded players playing in the forward line. In the past, Chelsea have neglected attacking prowess in their front three, putting a higher emphasis on creativity and so that may be about to change. Madueke is undoubtedly a goalscoring winger.  The Englishman\u2019s offensive play is resemblant to that of  The 21-year-old likes to look for the ball out wide, hugging the touchline before dribbling inside the backline and unleashing thunderous strikes on his left foot. This season, Madueke is averaging an xG of 0.41 per game while scoring 0.47 times per game, almost one in every two matches for PSV. Of course, the changeover from the Eredivisie to the Premier League will be something that Madueke has to adapt to but given he played academy football with Crystal Palace and Tottenham, the transition may be smoother than normal. One of Madueke\u2019s best attributes is that he doesn\u2019t rely on team-mates to create chances for him, similarly to  The England U21s international is scintillating when running with the ball at his feet and loves to take on the opposition\u2019s full-back. This season alone, Madueke has averaged 13.03 dribbles per game with an accuracy of 56.1 per cent as well as registering 66 carries into the penalty area, primarily coming from the right side. The attacker is a threat for any defender inside the box and his sharp dribbling makes it extremely difficult to stop him from getting past his man to create space for a shot. The only downside to having Madueke is that he is not the most creative player in Chelsea\u2019s squad with just two assists this season and a total expected assists of merely 2.66. This means that Potter will need to deploy a more creative player in the starting line-up to complement Madueke\u2019s lack of creativity. None of these players are Premier League proven.  Only Madueke has prior experience playing in English football but even that was at academy level. Nevertheless, with the money spent over the course of Boehly\u2019s short reign at Stamford Bridge, the new owner has put all his eggs in one basket in the hopes that these signings can showcase their quality in West London. Chelsea are really struggling this season under Potter but if these new players can gel together and form a cohesive unit, the Blues may be on for a very exciting end to the campaign."},

Virtually every boy in the neighbourhood is named after River Plate\u2019s iconic midfielder Enzo Francescoli, who had two spells with the club in the 80s and 90s.  was just the same. But now he is out on his own as   and the  . , Argentina\u2019s World Cup-winning midfielder arrives in England \u00adsaddled with huge expectation to deliver on the monstrous fee \u2014 and quickly.  Fernandez said: \"I am grateful to Chelsea and its ownership for doing everything they could to make me a part of this project. \"I\u2019m happy and excited to join the Pride of London, to play in the best league in the world and to compete for the biggest trophies.\" Chelsea owner Todd Boehly added: \"We are signing one of the brightest talents in global football. \"We are excited to add him to Graham\u2019s squad, we are sure he will form an important part of our team going forward. \"Enzo has demonstrated his ability at the highest \u00adlevels so we\u2019re looking forward to seeing what he does in blue!\" \n Maybe Boehly and manager   saw something in the player\u2019s nickname that travelled with him from South America when he joined \u00adBenfica last summer. Team-mates labelled him \u2018El musico\u2019 \u2014 \u2018the musician\u2019. So-called because Fernandez was known to conduct the entire team like a 10-piece orchestra from midfield. He is 22 and has played only 71 club matches in his career. The 72nd could come on Friday night in a  . Little known outside of the hipster community before November, Enzo is expected to lead Chelsea\u2019s rapidly-expanding and expensive international brigade into better times. Chelsea are 10th in the\u00a0Prem, out of both domestic cups and, in less than two weeks, face Borussia Dortmund to remain in the Champions League knockout stages.  So Fernandez walks into a club facing an uphill battle just to qualify for the Europa League and he will be expected to hit the ground running. Discovered by renowned Argentinian scout Pablo Esquivel at five years old, he was considered different to all the other Enzos even then. Esquivel said: \"When he was five you could tell he was different, different class. \"He was the leader of the team and all his passes were very clear. It was crystal clear he would take the right path.\" Fernandez\u2019s background is a familiar one of relative poverty. His parents were poor and the sacrifices they made to get him to where he is now remain a driving force. The wallpaper of tattoos covering his body are not there to intimidate. A small, innocuous inking at the base of his throat spells out \u2018fe\u2019 \u2014 the Portuguese word for \u2018faith\u2019.  Coincidentally, his new team-mate   has an identical one on his hands. The Fernandez family are River Plate fanatics, hence his name. Enzo Francescoli went on to play for Marseille and was so good that France great \u00ad  named a kid after him, too. There is no doubt the rapid transformation of Fernandez from impressive, young \u00admidfielder to world star is a massive risk for Chelsea. Just a few months ago, he was playing alongside Julian Alvarez for River Plate in the Copa Libertadores. Both players are now in the Prem and world champions. River Plate sold Fernandez for just \u00a316m last July.  They obviously knew a good thing too, as they insisted upon a 25 per cent sell-on clause.  It means  , taking the combined fee for Fernandez to \u00a342m, making him the most expensive Argentinian ever. But striker Alvarez, who scored six goals in one match they played together, cost Manchester City just \u00a314m after they shopped direct. Chelsea have piled pressure on a young man\u2019s shoulders by using middle men Benfica and paid through the nose. Described as a box-to-box midfielder, he uses both feet equally well, can shoot, defend and leads. One Argentinian source told SunSport: \"Chelsea have a new captain ready and waiting for when they want one.\" At Benfica, he has been most comfortable in a two-man midfield where he can roam alongside a defensive-minded player. More cautious observers from inside Stamford Bridge suggest it is dangerous to put so much faith in a player from watching him at the World Cup. There is no doubt Fernandez has quality \u2014 he was catapulted into Argentina\u2019s World Cup squad after just two friendlies. He was   and took home a\u00a0winners\u2019 medal. There is also no debate about his passion for football. At just 15 he produced an open letter to his idol  , who was considering international retirement. The teenage Fernandez wrote: \"How are we going to convince you to carry on playing if the rest of us suck at football? \"How are we going to convince you if we have had only one per cent of the pressure you endure every day, Lionel.\" Fernandez is about to get a little bit more of an idea what that pressure feels like."},

The goalkeeper left Man Utd in 2011 and would continue a successful career in the Championship with Watford, Brighton, Wolves and Birmingham before retiring in 2019. \n Since retiring, he says he still supports Man Utd and has a season ticket at Old Trafford. This left-back spent four years at Arsenal with the likes of Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas but only made 13 Premier League appearances. In a remarkable change of look, he is now rocking dreadlocks. The Frenchman played more times for Portsmouth during a loan spell in 2008 than he ever did for the Gunners. He was also able to enjoy a loan to Italian giants Juventus in 2010. It was after leaving Arsenal that he would begin to secure himself first team football, as he played 87 Premier League games for Queens Park Rangers, scoring two goals. Championship spells with Nottingham Forest and Cardiff followed before his retirement in 2020. This German made just one appearance for Arsenal, in a League Cup defeat to Sunderland in 2002. But that wouldn't stop him enjoying a long, fruitful career in the Premier League as he moved to Fulham. He would make 125 Premier League appearances at Craven Cottage before moving on in 2009. Spells at St Pauli and 1860 Munich would follow before he hung up his boots in 2015. However, he would stay in football to become assistant at RB Leipzig and then Galatasaray. An easy one for any true Geordie. A goalscoring Belgian centre-back who joined from Anderlecht in 1994. He netted eight times in 96 Premier League appearances for the Toon, with the most famous being an incredible left-footed lob in a 5-0 win over Man Utd. He is now working as a pundit for Belgian TV and owns his own fruit and veg company. This boyhood Man City fan would become a stalwart under Fergie as he won two league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League. Following a move from Blackburn in 1994, he made 85 Premier League appearances. He would leave in 2003 after nine years and move to Burnley. In 2006, he retired after two years with non-league Bacup Borough. The defender admits that his post-Man Utd days were tough, even telling a United podcast that he went on a 12-day binge and   after leaving Old Trafford. And despite all his achievements at United, he was briefly blocked from entering the Old Trafford pitch for a half time show as a steward didn't know who he was. Champions League winner, cult hero and... Master Chef. This former winger won the Swedish edition of the show earlier this year. And with his own pizzeria in Stockholm, he may one day end up better known for his flair in the kitchen than on the wing. Back in 1998, he joined from Parma as a backup to Ryan Giggs and scored his only goal for Man Utd in a 4-1 win at Everton. Far from just earning a Champions League medal though, this winger actually started in the final and missed a golden chance in the clash with Bayern Munich before being replaced by Teddy Sheringham. The rest, as they say, is history.  An impressive academy prospect who was a member of the Man Utd squad that won the Premier League and Champions League in 2008. He made six league appearances for the Red Devils and went on to enjoy a very fruitful top flight career with Burnley and Bolton. These days, the former flyer is maybe better known for his  . And he proved to be a very lucky man when the Hollyoaks star took him back after he was  . This Man Utd star was noticeable for his distinct curly hair when he came through the academy. But he would stand out even more today after being seen with a long hipster beard. After leaving Man Utd in 2001 with a Champions League winners medal he would go on to enjoy a long and distinct career at the highest level. Though never quite making the England squad, he was part of United coach Steve McClaren's Middlesbrough squad as they won the League Cup in 2004. And from there he would go on to enjoy six years as a key man for West Brom. Spells at Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Barnsley, York City and Tadcaster Albion would follow before he hung up his boots in 2017. But he has since got into management with Scarborough Athletic, who he guided to promotion to the National League North last season. This former England international spent the best part of two decades at the highest level. Coming through the Blackburn academy in 1998, he enjoyed five years at the club with his form so impressive that he played for England against Portugal in 2002. Once dubbed \"the New Gazza\", he would make a move to Birmingham in 2003 where he struggled with injuries. In 2007, he would return to Blackburn, where he would thrive for a further eight years, before moving to Oldham and retiring in 2016. He has had a variety of different professions since hanging up his boots. Coaching appears to have been his first passion as he managed Oldham Athletic and Barrow, while also taking roles at Blackpool and back at Blackburn. However, at one point he also became part of former Rovers star Garry Flitcroft's eco-construction company, Flitcraft. In 1996, this Inter Milan striker, famous for his flowing long hair, made the bizarre move to Sheffield Wednesday. In his three years with the Owls, he would be upstaged at times by fellow Italian Paolo di Canio, but he was no less effective as he won the Fans' Player of the Year award after finishing top scorer in 1999. A move to Aston Villa would follow after a contract struggle at Hillsborough. A season later he moved to Bradford City where he would become a club legend on and off the pitch. Despite Carbone's memorable goals, the Bantams were relegated in 2001 and fell into financial trouble. Then in 2002 he endeared himself to the Valley Parade faithful when he forfeited \u00a33.2m after being told the club would fold if they continued to pay him \u00a340,000 a week. He said in 2013: \"I hadn\u2019t earned anything like the amounts on offer in the Premier League today and I had a young family. \"But when I thought about it, there was only one choice I could make. I couldn\u2019t be the person who put Bradford City out of business.\" Now, however, he looks every bit management material as he rocks a stylish beard and short grey hair in his role as Azerbaijan assistant. Before he rocked the fisherman look, this Serbian striker arrived to huge fanfare at Stamford Bridge after firing 35 goals to win PSV the title and guiding Guus Hiddink's side to the Champions League semi-final. Such was the faith Jose Mourinho had in him that he was handed the Chelsea number nine shirt. However, he would go on a grim run of just four goals in 24 appearances. Moves to the likes of Atletico Madrid, Fenerbahce, PSG and Zenit St Petersburg would follow his departure from West London in 2005. But only his spell at Fenerbahce, where he scored a goal every other game, could truly be described as a success. Covered in religious tattoos, the devout Orthodox Christian once said he harboured dreams of becoming a monk. However, fate would give him a different, and less sanctified, role for him. He would become one of the Balkans' most influential football agents, representing, among others, perennial Man Utd and Arsenal transfer target Sergej Milinkovic-Savic."},

Because the voice on the end of the telephone was such a significant voice from your youth.\u00a0 And while other football commentators have a \u2018commentary voice\u2019 - and some even seem to subconsciously ape Motty\u2019s famous tones - the man himself commentated with his authentic, actual voice.\u00a0 It was a voice of authority and knowledge but, above all, it was the voice of a man who adored  .\u00a0 A man whose 50 years of service to the BBC were an unbridled joy and never a chore. The last time I phoned Motson,  , was to speak to him about the passing of legendary FA Cup giant-killer Ronnie Radford, whose goal helped Southern League Hereford United knock out top-flight Newcastle in 1972. That goal was the making of the young  , as he readily admitted. That third-round replay on an Edgar Street mudheap turned out to be his breakthrough commentary on Match of the Day. He would go on to take the microphone on over 2,000 matches for  TV and radio - including ten  s and 20 FA Cup Finals - without ever losing his boyish enthusiasm for the game. Motson fell in love with football when his father - a Methodist church minister - took him to Stamford Bridge on Christmas Day 1957 to watch a teenage Jimmy Greaves score four goals in a 7-4 victory for Chelsea over Portsmouth.\u00a0 A true journalist and avid newspaper reader, Motson began his career on the Barnet Press and then the Sheffield Morning Telegraph before he joined the broadcast media.\u00a0 And in the days when live televised football was strictly rationed in the 1970s and 80s, Motson - along with his ITV friend and rival Brian Moore - was the dominant voice of the national sport.\u00a0 Motson\u2019s was a friendly, excitable voice. And one which was ahead of its time in rattling out stats.\u00a0 Although he once told me: \u201cWhen I started stats were quite rare and people used to criticise me for using too many \u2013 now the stats men have taken over. \u201cIronically I use fewer stats now than I ever have because there are so many of them. I struggle with it. Expected goals? I had to have that explained to me. And all these diagrams? Heat maps? What do they mean?\u201d One of Motson\u2019s best-known lines came at the final whistle of Wimbledon\u2019s shock 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup Final - \u2018the Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club\u2019. But nothing ever quite surpassed his first major outing, that Radford piledriver and a winner from Ricky George.\u00a0 Motson would become firm friends with all out that Hereford side and was invited to their regular reunions.\u00a0 He sounded alert and well when we spoke about Radford back in November, not long before the World Cup in Qatar.\u00a0\u00a0 You can watch footage of Radford\u2019s famous goal and Motson\u2019s commentary on YouTube.  He captures the thrill of an historic footballing moment perfectly.\u00a0 Decades later, Motson always sounded like a fan - a fan armed with forensic knowledge of the game - but still the same football lover who had watched the great Greaves at the Bridge that long-ago Christmas. Five years ago, during Motson\u2019s final season as a TV commentator, we met at his Hertfordshire home and for lunch at his local pub, posing in his trademark sheepskin coats - always handmade by nearby Hide\u2019s Couture.\u00a0 He had finished live commentaries in 2008 but continued to work for Match of the Day - and he took great pride from the fact that the BBC highlights show had kept them same format, and huge popularity, despite the vast changes in football and the media since the Premier League launch in 1992.\u00a0 Motson, who is survived by his wife Anne and son Frederick, admitted he led a \u2018blessed\u2019 life, following football for a living for half a century.\u00a0 And he felt privileged that his instantly-recognisable voice filled up the nation\u2019s living rooms, as if he were a family friend.\u00a0 It is deeply sad that the voice of football has fallen silent now. But Motson\u2019s was a life well lived.\u00a0"},

Thousands of migrant workers have reportedly died in the Qatari construction industry since the World Cup was awarded to them in 2010. Concerns were also raised over the rights of fans travelling to the event - especially   individuals and women, who rights groups say Qatari laws discriminate against. And today Labour party member Neville, 47, likened the human rights disgraces in the Arab country to the strikes taking place in the UK. He said: \u201cThe working system of Kafala which obviously through football the conversation has started and it's been removed here now in Qatar but it is abhorrent and we should detest low pay, we should detest poor accommodation and working conditions. \"We can never accept that in this region or any other region and it is just worth mentioning we've got a current government in our country that are demonising rail workers, ambulance workers and terrifyingly nurses. \"In our country we've got to look at workers' rights but when football goes, we have to pick up on workers' rights wherever it goes because people have got to be equal and treated equal. \"We can't have people being paid an absolute pittance to work, we can't have people in accommodation that is unsavoury and disgusting. It shouldn't happen here. \"That shouldn't happen here with the wealth that exists.\u00a0 \"But it shouldn't happen with the nurses in our country either where our nurses are having to fight for an extra pound or two pounds.\" Fans rushed to social media to blast his claims.

Thinks he\u2019s now a third-rate politician.\u201d Another said: \u201cSwitched to BBC despite wanting to watch Keane.\u00a0 \u201cYou have Neville being thick forgetting about the estimated 6500 migrant deaths equating that with strikes in U.K.\u201d A third said: \u201cTurned off as soon as you went all hypocritical again. Picking up millions for working in Qatar while justifying it because nurses are on strike. Not the brightest are you.\u201d However, some people praised the former footie star for speaking out. One person said: \u201cWell Gary Neville was being asked about Human Rights. Surely he\u2019s entitled to state his opinion. It\u2019s been a big part of the World Cup background.\u201d"},

Under the careful, defensive approach of Diego Simeone, the attacking flair of Joao Felix hasn't always been on show since his move from Benfica in 2019. But with the handbrake off in an attacking system at the World Cup in Qatar, the Portuguese forward has shone on their way to this weekend's quarter final. He has one goal and two assists so far in his three appearances at the World Cup, which isn't too far off his three goals and three assists in 18 appearances for Atletico. PSG are the current 5/2 favourites to sign him with Betfair. With three-and-a-half years left on his current deal and a reported \u00a386million fee on his head, PSG would appear most likely to pay that. Manchester United (5/1) and Chelsea (6/1) are in need of attacking reinforcements and are next best in the betting. Betfair odds Felix's compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo's axing from Old Trafford has freed up space for Felix to move into, with his versatility across the front a huge positive. Ronaldo has been linked with a move to Chelsea but should that fall through, Felix to Stamford Bridge is another huge possibility. Probably Arsenal (15/2) less so, though the injury to Gabriel Jesus could see the Gunners scramble for attacking reinforcements in January. Aston Villa are the surprise name in the betting, though reports have linked him with a move to link up with Unai Emery. Press in Spain suggest the player's agent's relationship with Emery could see him move on an initial loan deal with the option to buy. They are 10/1, however - the same price as Newcastle. Liverpool (18/1) and Real Madrid (33/1) are the outsiders and less likely next destinations for Felix.

However, captain Harry Kane has revealed that a card game titled Werewolf has had a positive impact on the camp. England spend a majority of their evenings at the team's hotel beach front in   playing Werewolf. It is a card game which requires strategic thinking to come out on top and the objective of the game is to identify and kill the werewolves amongst the villagers. Werewolf takes place over a series of game rounds and each round has two phases - day and night. During the day, the village discusses who they think is guilty and during the night, players can use special powers while the werewolves make their kill. Players start by shuffling and dealing out the game cards, making sure to include two werewolves, a Doctor, and a Seer card.  There are also wild cards that can be played such as the Drunk, the Witch, and the Alpha Werewolf.  It starts off in the night phase where the moderator has the werewolves choose a victim, the Doctor is allowed to save one person, and the Seer gets to make a guess on the person they suspect of being a werewolf.  When the night round concludes, the day round starts and the players discuss their characters before taking a vote on who they believe is a werewolf.  That player is then killed and the night round begins again. The game continues until either the werewolves or the villagers win.  admitted that it is a good way to build the team chemistry and a large group of the squad get involved. Kane, 29, said: \"There about 16 or 17 of us that play Wolf and it is a great way to kill some time. It also helps with team bonding. And  also revealed it's a game you can enjoy by just watching. Phillips said: \"It's definitely one you can watch as it's quite funny and even if I'm not around there, when they get somebody out. You can hear them cheering by the pool.\""},

But standing in their way is a resolute France side, the current holders, who won't give up the trophy without a fight. There's a sense of excitement surrounding the current, youthful squad. For decades,   supporters have been forced to put up with uninspiring, humdrum squads - particularly since the so-called 'Golden Generation' called time on their careers. During those years, a host of big-name, foreign Premier League players were being tipped to swap allegiances and represent England. Even more recently, some superstars - including Erling Haaland - have been linked with playing for the Three Lions. Borussia Dortmund wonderkid Giovanni Reyna was also rumoured to play for England, having been born in Sunderland during dad Claudio's spell in the Premier League. However, Reyna has now represented the USA 12 times to put an end to those rumours. But he was by no means the first foreign player to be considered by England. Check out our best XI of those who got away... THE Italian spent 12 years in England playing for Chelsea and then Tottenham. In 2003, Cudicini was on the radar of the FA but a Fifa rule-change scuppered their plans. Cudicini never earned a senior cap for Italy, stuck behind Gianluigi Buffon. BORN in Lagos, Nigeria, Moses spent five years working his way through England's youth ranks - playing 29 matches in total. However, the   man opted for Nigeria in 2012, two years after earning his sole cap for England's Under-21s. Moses had initially opted to play for England and saw his Nigeria debut delayed as his application to Fifa to switch nationalities was submitted late. BORN and raised in Nottingham, Morgan spent a decade at Forest before joining Leicester in 2012. Morgan would have been in contention for a spot in the England team during Leicester's incredible 2015-16 title success. But in 2013, the centre-back switched allegiances to Jamaica - for whom he played 30 times until his final game in 2016. SNUBBED time and time again by France, the former Manchester City, Portsmouth and Everton star popped up on England's radar in the 2000s and early 2010s. Distin played more Premier League games than any other foreign outfield player in history. But the defender never earned a cap for France - having also failed to feature in any of their youth squads. England were believed to be interested but saw their plans scuppered by the Home Nations Agreement. THRIVING during his time at Everton, Arteta failed to break into the Spain squad, stuck behind Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets and Cesc Fabregas in the pecking order. That piqued England's interest under Fabio Capello but a Fifa rule change in 2010 scuppered any plans of calling up the now-Arsenal boss. The FA believed   to be eligible due to the five-year residency rule, but Fifa rejected the claim. The high-flying Arsenal boss himself threatened to 'go to war' but decided against a battle with Fifa. BORN in Lancaster, England, the Man Utd star would go on to reveal he had always wanted to play for Scotland, having Scottish blood on his father's side. But before that admission, both England and Scotland were chasing the midfielder. Alex McLeish battled horrific weather to reach Carrington to speak with   about his allegiance, while Southgate 'just sent a text'. That - and a nudge from Sir Alex Ferguson - convinced McTominay to opt for Scotland. EDU was close to picking England as his national team after being granted a British passport during his five years at  . The midfielder seriously considered the Three Lions, believing his chance of earning a place in the Brazil squad was limited. However, Edu was called up by Brazil in 2004, ending the debate. The Arsenal supremo would go on to play 15 times for the South American giants. IN 2013, then bursting onto the scene at Man Utd, Roy Hodgson revealed he was looking into the possibility of Januzaj playing for the Three Lions. Hodgson believed the winger fulfilled the requirements to qualify for England - which he didn't. Januzaj would go on to play for Belgium and even scored the winner against England in their 2018 World Cup group game. HAVING moved to England from Ivory Coast at the age of four, Zaha appeared fully committed to the Three Lions.  played 13 times for England's Under-21s and even played twice for the   team. However, as both games were friendlies the winger was still eligible to switch to Ivory Coast. After failing to be called up for four years, Zaha did turn to the African nation in search of international football in 2017 and has gone on to play 28 times. BALE was always eligible to play for England through his grandmother. Having spent all of his youth career from the age of 10 at Southampton, the Three Lions had hoped he'd play for them. However, he was quick to snub England and would go on to play for Wales. In 2016,   even said: \"I wouldn't care if I never qualified - I would never play for England.\" BORN in Leeds during dad Alf-Inge's time in the Premier League,   was incredibly eligible to play for England. However, there was never any doubt in Haaland's mind he would play for Norway like his old man. He has since played 23 times, scoring 21 goals - making himself ineligible to play for England, and is starring for Man City."},

I was one of those who had doubts about a winter tournament, about playing it halfway through the season and about it being in  . But it\u2019s been a success you couldn\u2019t have imagined.  And despite all the scare stories beforehand, it has been a real enjoyment every way you look at it. Conditions have been fantastic for the players, it\u2019s not been roasting hot and we\u2019re not having stoppages every game to throw bottles of water over them. The football\u2019s been great, we\u2019ve had plenty of shocks \u2014 and as long as it doesn\u2019t include  , we always love that \u2014 but most of all it has been fun. One of the huge things that sticks out for me is how everyone \u2014 and I mean EVERYONE \u2014 is saying how safe it\u2019s been. Look, we all know the issues about having it in Qatar, and I\u2019m not going to sit here and start saying everything there is rosy. But, in terms of this tournament, I think back to how everyone was kicking off at the thought of not being able to have a drink at the games, and it\u2019s laughable. Yes, there\u2019s a different culture towards drinking over there.  But it\u2019s their culture, their country and you can\u2019t say it hasn\u2019t been a better World Cup all round because of it. Has everyone ? What about all the fighting in France in 2016? How many times have the headlines been about fighting and aggro? And it\u2019s always when people have been on the drink. We could take a big leaf out of their book in terms of the approach to it, although I\u2019m not daft enough to think we will change our mentality over it. But this will go down as the World Cup when we all felt so safe, where the fans were behaving and we weren\u2019t rattling up the number of arrests. Supporters are still lighting up the stadiums, singing and dancing on the Metro and in the streets, where women, kids, and families are having the time of their lives. In fact it\u2019s been such a success that I\u2019d have no problem with the Middle East staging the   again \u2014 or with it being in the middle of our season either. And on the pitch there have been some huge shocks. Who thought Morocco would win their group and Belgium go out? Or Japan would beat Spain AND Germany. There was one of the biggest upsets ever when Argentina lost to Saudi Arabia and Cameroon became the first African nation ever to beat Brazil. Of course, the big names have stood out like we always hoped and thought they would. Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Cristiano Ronaldo... they\u2019ve all been headline news at one stage or another. But the one player to leave a huge impression on me is Harry Souttar, the centre-half born in Scotland who plays for Stoke and was sensational for Australia. If I was still a   manager, he\u2019d be the one I\u2019d be trying to sign. I saw him three years ago on loan at Fleetwood and thought he had a real chance then and have kept an eye on him ever since.  He got a real bad injury a year ago and only came back just before the World Cup. Harry\u2019s 6ft 6in, quick, strong, he can pass a ball and knows the English game \u2013 he\u2019d be a great buy for someone. He reminds me of Dan Burn, who went round the houses on loan, went to Brighton and then ended up at Newcastle and everyone\u2019s raving about him. But, all in all, it will go down as a fantastic World Cup \u2014 and the great thing is we\u2019ve still got another week to go!"},

Three Lions superfans Neal Weekes and Fil Sollof, have travelled from England to Qatar just for Saturday evening's game, a 48-hour round trip. The pair made the 6,500-mile journey by plane, train, car, and even cruise ship, travelling via Turkey to Doha. Neal, 57, said: \"We wouldn't miss this match for the world.

's Donbass Arena was the site of four games during the Euro 2012 tournament, but today, it is essentially abandoned, caught up in  's brutal  . It hosted  's last competitive game with  , a 1-1 draw on June 11, 2012, during the group stage. The Three Lions took the lead thanks to a header from Joleon Lescott but were pegged back before halftime thanks to a fine finish from his then-Manchester City teammate Samir Nasri. And the stadium would also be the sight of another England match eight days later when a single Wayne Rooney goal helped his team to a nervy 1-0 win over hosts Ukraine. In total, the stadium would be used for five games during the tournament, the final time being the semi-final between Portugal and eventual-winners Spain. England face France in the first competitive game between the two sides in a decade on Saturday, in the quarter-finals of the   in Qatar. Completed in 2009, the Donbass Arena was one of eight venues used for Euro 2012, which was jointly hosted by Ukraine and Poland. With a capacity of just over 52,000, it was the third-largest stadium in the tournament. It was one of five newly-built stadiums used, costing a total of $400million (\u00a3329m in today's money). Top firm ArupSport, who also designed Manchester City's Etihad Arena and Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena were brought in to create the complex. With its soaring roof illuminated at night, its design was compared to a flying saucer. The stadium was also home to local club Shakhtar Donetsk, who won the Europa League in 2009 just months before moving into their new stadium. Fulham were the first UK team to play at the stadium when they earned a 1-1 draw in the Europa League on February 25, 2010, en-route to the final later that year. Arsenal were beaten 2-1 at the stadium in a Champions League clash on November 3, 2010, and the team would claim another Premier League scalp in October 2012 when they beat Chelsea 2-1. The last English side to play at the Donbass Arena was Manchester United, who drew 1-1 on October 2, 2013, in the Champions League. As well as football, the stadium was used as a concert venue, hosting Beyonce's first-ever Ukraine concert for its grand opening in 2009. As a result of shelling, there are numerous damages of the northwestern facade of the stadium But the stadium was dramatically shut in 2014 after fighting broke out between Russian-backed forces and Ukraine in the east of the country. In August 2014, less than a year after Man Utd played there, the stadium was shelled in the war, damaging its outside. Pictures and videos showed heavy damage to the turnstiles and entrances to the arena. The football club's official Twitter revealed that the stadium was hit by two explosions in the early hours of the morning. \"On 23 August, at 6:00, two powerful explosions occurred at Donbass Arena,\" it said. \"As a result of shelling, there are numerous damages of the northwestern facade of the stadium, communications, equipment and detached building of the energy centre, which is located in the northern part of the Donbass Arena park. \"There are no casualties among the stadium staff.\" By this point, the club had already moved out of its home, relocating more than 600 miles west to Lviv, far from the front line. Fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists has continued on and off ever since, making it unsafe for Shakhtar to return. In 2018, the Russian state media agency DAN claimed the turf at the arena had been repaired, quoting the stadium's technical director Valery Gavrilov at the time. He also said the official Shakhtar Donetsk museum was being reopened. With Russia launching an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February this year, the city of Donetsk has seen an upsurge in shelling. In March, Russian state TV channel Rossiya-1 claimed that the Donbass Arena had been shelled by Ukrainian forces. The channel claimed without evidence that \"dozens of people were injured\" in the shelling, and that Kyiv's forces were \"targeting civilian objects\" such as the stadium. It shared footage showing shell craters just metres from the stadium, as well as a number of shattered windows on its outside. The Donbass Arena has not hosted a game since 2014, when Shakhtar defeated Illichivets Mariupol 3-1 to secure their fifth straight league title, but barely 18,000 turned up due to the looming conflict. Two days later the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic was illegally raised over the city and Ukrainian forces responded with shelling. It isn't known when if ever the stadium will be used again, with Donetsk being declared part of Russia by   in September. For now, the venue remains an eerie reminder of the fragility of peace in Europe."},

When asked by ITV whether he wants the attacking approach of his team to remain, he said: \"Yeah without a doubt. \"There is no point going into a game like this and just covering up and sitting on the ropes.

Southgate brought Bukayo Saka back into the fold and kept the trio of Declan Rice, Jordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham - an impressively balanced midfield that thrived against Wales and then also in the last-16 victory.

The Manchester United man bagged two goals against Wales but then had to settle for a place on the bench behind Saka in the last-16 as Foden switched to the left.

Another potential alteration is the introduction of Kieran Trippier at right-back. Kyle Walker is widely considered to be the best option to combat the threat of  , but he has only just returned from injury in time for the tournament. Southgate could surprise us all by dropping the Manchester City man and bringing in Trippier - who has been a loyal servant for the England boss since he took charge. The third and final line-up that could be utilised by Southgate within this attacking 4-3-3 framework is an incredibly gung-ho approach. That is to take Rice out and drop   into the holding midfield role. The Borussia Dortmund teenager has been sensational at the World Cup so far, proving he is capable of pretty much anything. And moving him to the base of the midfield would open up another spot in the attack, allowing Foden to come into the midfield and possibly creating a space on the left for Jack Grealish."},

We both agreed that   is an unhinged monster, but we couldn\u2019t agree on just how awful she is. We were dreaming up better and stronger insults, none of which can be published here, even though they\u2019re all perfectly fair. Until eventually, my friend became so lost in the insult thesaurus, she lost concentration and hit the hedge. NO ONE enjoys Christmas shopping. And I disenjoy it more than most as I have six kids to buy for, as well as 17 godchildren and lots of people at the farm. Every year, I vow that I will start the process in good time.  So I sit down in about September with a pen and paper, hoping to write a list of all the things that I\u2019ll buy.  And my mind always goes blank. I literally can\u2019t think of anything at all. I know you can\u2019t buy a girl something that has a plug. I have no idea why this is. I just know it to be so.  And I know that boys all want  . But I also know that buying the wrong video game is worse than not buying anything at all. It\u2019s like when my mum bought me a pair of Wrangler jeans instead of the Levi\u2019s I craved. To her they were all just \u201cjeans\u201d. And then my uncle, who knew I liked books, bought me one called \u201cChristian Art\u201d.  To go with a present from my grandad, who acknowledged my interest in prog rock by buying me an LP of African tribal music. Keen to avoid mistakes like this, I turned to  for inspiration, but that never works because pretty soon I\u2019m looking at generators. And then I\u2019m fishing around for my spectacles so that I can read the faded little number on the back of my credit card and then I order a rather funky looking number with camo paint. So that\u2019s my  present to myself sorted out. But for everyone else, I had to go out to do actual shopping. Have you tried that recently? It\u2019s impossible. In one shop I visited this week, they wanted my passport and my driving licence before I could buy anything. It had something to do with money laundering, apparently.  In the next shop, there was all sorts of jewellery. There was even a silver dildo.  But I didn\u2019t think that would be an appropriate present from a godfather. Especially to a boy.  So I selected a bit of gold rope which, like everything else in all jewellery shops, had no price tag. When I found out how much it was, after it had already been wrapped, I went into a dead faint and had to be brought round with wine. I then made my excuses and ran. And ended up in a funky looking shop where there was a gimmicky looking watch in the window, festooned with all sorts of baubles and nonsense.  As it had a plastic strap, I figured it\u2019d be reasonable, so I asked the shop girl how much. \u201c325\u201d, she replied.  That seemed steep, right up to the moment when she gave me the credit card machine. Which read \u201c\u00a3325,000\u201d. For a bloody watch!!! So far then, I\u2019d bought nothing. Except a generator. I tried to buy some cufflinks at one point, but after the suspiciously neat and tidy man had spent 30 minutes in a back room gift-wrapping them for me, I got bored and left. And ended up in a shop where they wanted my email address and phone number, and the purchasing process took so long, I fled, bumped into a friend and decided to go to the pub.  I can\u2019t remember what happened after that. But I definitely didn\u2019t buy anything. Or if I did, I must have left it in a cab. Today then, I\u2019m faced with going out there again, poring over stuff that\u2019s uninteresting and overpriced. And then having to hand over all my personal details before I\u2019m allowed to buy it. Can you imagine if   did this, a full background check on you every time you filled up.  It\u2019d be quicker to have an electric car and wait around for two hours as it charged. I realise, of course, that some people like shopping. They like to linger and peruse. I believe they\u2019re called \u201cwomen\u201d. I, on the other hand, am a \u201cman\u201d so I like everything to be done as quickly as possible.  I use a barber in  , not because he\u2019s good but because I\u2019m in and out of there in less than five minutes.  And I want the same in a shop. I want price tags on display in bold type.  And I want to swipe what I\u2019ve bought over a screen, touch my card on a machine and be back in the car ten seconds later. Which is why, this year, everyone is getting pasta, tins of tomato soup and razor blades. From my local Co-op. THIS bonking ban in Bali isn\u2019t as troubling as you might think. Contrary to what some hysterical reports would have you believe, you will be able to go there with your partner, even if you\u2019re not married, and you\u2019ll still be able to share a room. However, the ban is a problem for BLT+ people who actually live on this paradise island. Because they aren\u2019t allowed to get married, which means they can never do sex. Well let me say here and now that if there are any Balinese lesbians who need to get it on, my spare room is free at the moment. LIKE everyone else, I was completely unstunned to read about  \u2019 tantrum at some kind of fashion event this week. I\u2019ve always never been interested in this kind of nonsense. Apparently, the dress she\u2019d been given \u2013 for free \u2013 wasn\u2019t to her liking,  Where hopefully her mum and dad gave her a smacked bottom and told her to stop being so spoilt. I VISITED a doctor this week. I know, amazing, right?  She had a surname that would have scored about 5,000 on a Scrabble board and a strong accent, so I asked where she was from. At this point, she could have called the police and accused me of a hate crime and racism, but instead she said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve lived here for 20 years but originally I\u2019m from Gdansk.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cI was there back in the summer.

Nabil Fekir nabbed the winner and it will have been not so much the loss but the lack of any real attacking ambition that will have left   scratching that shiny head of his. For certain he\u2019ll want to get back down to work with his top men as soon as possible with the   drawing to its climax. Only around 5,000 fans turned up in the giant green \u2013 seated hulk of the Estadio Benito Villamarin stadium - capacity 60,000.

The music was written by the Lightning Seeds'\u00a0Ian Broudie, along with comedians\u00a0David Baddiel\u00a0and\u00a0Frank Skinner - presenters of the hit football-themed comedy show\u00a0Fantasy Football League. This song is one of only three songs to top the British charts twice with different lyrics, the others being \"Mambo No. 5\" (in versions by\u00a0Lou Bega\u00a0and\u00a0Bob the Builder) and \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (by\u00a0Band Aid\u00a0and\u00a0Band Aid 30). It was rereleased in 1998 with updated words. It regularly reappears in the UK singles chart around major football tournaments involving the England team. England wear three lions on their shirts - as they have done ever since the first international against Scotland in 1872 - because it is the logo of the FA. However where that logo comes from is a much longer and interesting story. The lions have a history going back to the 12th century, when a standard with three gold lions on a red field was carried into battle to inspire the troops. The first one came from Henry I - known as the lion of England - who had a lion on his standard on taking power in 1100. Shortly afterwards he married Adeliza, whose father also had a lion on his shield, and to commemorate the event he added a second lion to his standard. In 1154, two lions became three when Henry II married Eleanor of Aquitaine, who also had a lion on her family crest. Richard the Lionheart later used three golden lions on a scarlet background as a symbol of the English throne and, after that, it appeared on the Royal Arms of every succeeding monarch. So when the FA was formed in 1863, it seemed natural enough to base their logo on this stirring royal shield. Since then, the design has only been changed once, in 1949 - when the crown that was on top of the lions was removed to differentiate the badge from that of the English cricket team."},

Many Parisians congratulated   for taking such a humorous approach to the crunch match. While one woman shouted \u201cgo home\u201d after seeing the cheeky poster projected onto her street. Paris couple Louis Lemarchand, 23, and Fanny Thoumy, 22, were delighted to see an image of Harry Kane appearing in front of the Eiffel Tower, but insisted: \u201cFrance are still going to win\u201d Louis said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great game, and I think France will win 3-1. \u201cGood luck to the English \u2013 they have fantastic fans, but that won\u2019t be enough.\u201d Fanny said: \u201cWow \u2013 those projections are absolutely amazing.

You English should go home!\u201d Le Parisien, the French capital\u2019s daily newspaper, described our daring stunt as \"an advertising campaign full of 'So-British' humour\". It continued in an editorial: \"On the eve of the World Cup quarter-final between England and France, the British daily remembered the anthem of Euro 1996. \"All in the streets of Paris thanks to an unprecedented advertising campaign with posters full of very British humour.\" The paper also writes \"that this audacious campaign had won smiles from some Parisians.\" L\u2019Equipe\u00a0 \u2013 France\u2019s sports daily \u2013 writes that\u00a0The Sun \"hit hard this Friday by displaying in Paris, around the Eiffel Tower, its support for the English squad. \"Never stingy with clich\u00e9s when it comes to mocking the Froggies, the daily projected several visuals featuring the stars of the Three Lions accompanied by amusing punchlines with dubious puns.\" Napoleon Bonaparte would be spinning in his grave at how easily we penetrated the French capital\u2019s defences. Under the cover of darkness we ghosted up to the Eiffel Tower. There in front of the 984ft Iron Lady we demonstrated the power of England\u2019s attack as our 30ft high images roared on the Three Lions. Jude Bellingham, 19, Bukayo Saka, 21, Phil Foden, 22, Marcus Rashford, 25, Walker, 32, and Kane, 29, all stood proudly way above the commuters, Christmas shoppers and tourists. At the Trocadero, in front of France\u2019s most famous symbol, two England fans cheered on our stunt. Lauren Wilks, 23, a nursery practitioner from Sheffield, said: \u201cI think The Sun\u2019s England projections are really great.\u201d While Lewis Margrim, 29, a steelworker from Sheffield agreed that England will be victorious tomorrow evening. He said: \u201cI think England are going to win 2-1. If we keep Mbappe quiet we\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Kyle Walker\u2019s hometown is Sheffield and England fans will be hoping his steely calm and lightning pace can stop Mbappe in his tracks. \u201cKyle can do it,\u201d said Lewis. Mbappe, 23, is the tournament\u2019s top scorer with five goals and is the best paid football player in the world. Also lighting up the sky were the screens of mobile phones videoing the event. People gathered, called their friends and pointed towards the massive images of England stars. To make sure the messages were clear we delivered them to our Gallic neighbours over the channel in both French and English. At Avenue du Maine Frenchman Gerard Jeandin chuckled at the stunt. He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s funny. We don\u2019t have to fight.\u201d Along rue du General Camou, under the lights of the Eiffel Tower, more people gathered to take in the sight of England\u2019s Lions. Moniq Bisla, 31, and a British marketing manager who lives in Paris said: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see this in Paris.\u00a0 \u201cI think England have got a really good chance of winning.\u201d Tomas Olaio, 19, from Lisbon, Portugal, \u201cThose images are brilliant. I hope Portugal ends up playing England in the tournament.\u201d The proud projections, including lethal striker Rashford, who has scored three goals so far at the Qatar World Cup, even convinced one teenager to get behind our boys. Alicia Puyo, 18, from Barcelona, Spain, said: \u201cMy country is out, but this has inspired me to start supporting England.\u201d In the trendy 3rd arrondissement, where young men and women gathered in the cold outside bars and cafes we projected the images of England stars two more times. Above the heads of the chattering drinkers attacking genius Foden tugged with pride on his England badge and teenage maestro Bellingham, whose displays in Qatar have seen him declared the best midfielder in the world, grabbed his own shirt with delight. Any of Southgate\u2019s strong squad could be heroes tomorrow night. The team\u2019s chances were boosted by the return of 28-year-old striker Raheem Sterling, who had left the training camp to be with his family in London following a raid on his home. Across England fans will be crowding into bars and families will gather in front of TV screens to cheer them on. It is estimated that 22 million people will tune in for the match, which kicks off at 7pm. Defeating the French in the knockout stages of the World Cup would be a historic victory. But even before tomorrow's historic clash England stars have already made their mark in France."},

At the end of the week they took on fellow Prem side Aston Villa, looking to gain match sharpness before the league's Boxing Day resumption. With both sides missing players, a number of youngsters were called on to play, including Villa ace Kadan Young, 16. The youngster was introduced at half-time with his side leading 1-0 through John McGinn's seventh minute strike. And he produced a cameo performance that Cucurella will hope to forget in a hurry. One moment that has grabbed fans' attention came in the 91st minute. Winger Young picked up the ball on the halfway line, embarking on an exciting foray into Chelsea's half. Cucurella attempted to get back, only to be repeatedly bamboozled by his prodigious opponent. Just as he thought he'd recovered his position, Young outmuscled him - sending him embarrassingly sprawling to the deck. None of Young's team-mates were able to get on the end of his cut-back, but the moment inspired a lot of talk online - with some Chelsea fans unimpressed with their megabucks signing. Taking to Reddit to comment on the clip, one supporter wrote: \"It doesn't take a lot of effort to outmuscle Cucurella but good play nonetheless.\" A second wrote: \"Man, I know it's only been 4 months but Cucurella just doesn't look anything like the player Chelsea signed from Brighton.\" While a third huffed: \"He does nothing every time I watch Chelsea. Man's like Forrest Gump, all he does is just run and that's about it.\" And a fourth fumed: \"Maybe he wasn't that good in the first place. They overpaid massively for him considering that he doesn't have many outstanding traits.\" Another fan decided to praise Young's perseverance against his more senior opponent, writing: \"Cucurella bodied the lad a few times before this, was satisfying to see Kadan give some back. Looks like an exciting prospect for the future.\" Young is yet to feature for Villa's first team in a competitive match, and has only made two appearances for their Under-21s this campaign. He has played three times in the Under-18s Premier League this term, grabbing a goal and two assists.

Modric earns around \u00a3315,000 per week at the Bernabeu but  , that figure at PSG. And the   legend has more than 14 times the number of Instagram followers with a whopping 388m compared to Modric's 26.5m.   But all the stats, numbers and history can be put to one side at 7pm this evening when the two legends of football step out at the Lusail Stadium in front of 88,000 supporters knowing they will lead their adoring nations into the World Cup final with a win. For Messi, it is the one trophy missing from his eye-watering collection. He has already said this will be his last World Cup and after losing the 2014 final to Germany, this could be his perfect farewell. For Modric, he too has tasted defeat in the biggest match in the game as France were crowned champions four years ago.  In his forties by the time the 2026 World Cup kicks off in North America, even for the ageless midfield maestro this will be his last chance to promote himself as one of the best midfielders to grace the grass.

The   20-year-old\u2019s lack of action in Qatar was a mystery during the tournament. Coach Gregg Berhalter had claimed that Reyna, whose father Claudio was a childhood pal and US team-mate, was suffering with a minor muscle problem. Reyna publicly denied that he was injured and hinted that there were other underlying issues between him and the coach. It has now emerged that Reyna\u2019s team-mates were so angry at his behaviour and \u201calarming lack of effort\u201d around the team camp in Doha that they held a   to see if he should be sent home. But Reyna hit back by explaining his attitude was a direct result of being told by Berhalter before the start of the tournament that he would have a marginal role - and suggested team-mates and the coach were giving misleading accounts. Reyna went on Instagram to post: \u201cI hoped not to comment on matters at the  .\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is my belief that things that happen in a team setting ought to remain private.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat being said, statements have been made that reflect on my professionalism and character, so I feel the need to make a brief statement.\u201d He added: \u201cJust before the World Cup, Coach Berhalter told me that my role at the tournament would be very limited.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was devastated.\u00a0I am someone who plays with pride and passion.\u00a0\u00a0 Soccer is my life, and I believe in my abilities.\u00a0 \u201cI fully expected and desperately wanted to contribute to the play of a talented group as we tried to make a statement at the World Cup.\u201d Reyna\u2019s behaviour began to cause problems during a pre-tournament warm-up against Qatari club Al Gharafa, where he was accused of \u201cwalking around throughout the game\u201d. It saw him taken to one side by team-mates DeAndre Yedlin and Aaron Long who were said to have repeatedly asked him to show more effort. Reyna\u2019s reaction to not getting on in the   was to hurl his shin pads across the dressing room floor, widening the rift with the coach and his colleagues, although he eventually made cameo appearances against both   and Holland. Berhalter, in what US team chiefs described as \u201coff the record\u201d comments made at a \u201cleadership summit\u201d in New York after his return from Qatar, said: \u201cIn this last World Cup, we had a player that was clearly not meeting expectations on and off the field.\u00a0 \u201cOne of 26 players, so it stood out.\u00a0As a staff, we sat together for hours deliberating what we were going to do with this player. \u201cWe were ready to book a plane ticket home, that's how extreme it was.\u00a0 \u201cWhat it came down to was, we're going to have one more conversation with him, and part of the conversation was how we're going to behave from here out. There aren\u2019t going to be any more infractions. It's going to have to go deeper than just \"Guys, I'm sorry \u201cBut the other thing we said to him was, \u2018you're going to have to apologise to the group, but it's going to have to say why you\u2019re apologising. It's going to have to go deeper than just \"Guys, I'm sorry.\"\u00a0 \u201cAnd I prepped the leadership group with this.\u00a0 I said, \u2018Okay, this guy's going to apologise to you as a group, to the whole team.\u00a0 \u201cAnd what was fantastic in this whole thing is that after he apologised, they stood up one by one and said, \u2018Listen, it hasn\u2019t been good enough, You haven\u2019t been meeting our expectations of a team-mate and we want to see change.\u2019 \u201cThey really took ownership of that process. And from that day on there were no issues with this player.\u201d Berhalter and his staff opted not to take part in the vote, leaving the final decision to the players, and Reyna was allowed to stay only after winning the ballot by the smallest margin of 13-12. Now Reyna has conceded he did lose focus and that his behaviour was out of line - although he is furious at the briefing against him. I apologised to my team-mates and coach for this, and I was told I was forgiven The youngster added: \u201cI am also a very emotional person, and I fully acknowledge that I let my emotions get the best of me and affect my training and behaviour for a few days after learning about my limited role.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI apologised to my team-mates and coach for this, and I was told I was forgiven.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThereafter, I shook off my disappointment and gave everything I had on and off the field.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am disappointed that there is continuing coverage of this matter (as well as some highly fictionalised versions of events) and extremely surprised that anyone on the US men's team staff would contribute to it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCoach Berhalter has always said that issues that arise with the team will stay \"in house\" so we can focus on team unity and progress.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI love my team, I love representing my country, and I am focusing now only on improving and growing as a soccer player and a person.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope that going forward each person involved in US Soccer focuses only on what is in the best interest of the men's national team so we can enjoy great success at the World Cup in 2026.\u201d"},
{"title": "England will not find a better manager than Gareth Southgate\u2026 and Southgate may not find a better job than England", "author": "Dave Kidd", "date": "11 Dec 2022", "content": "GARETH SOUTHGATE went to Qatar believing this World Cup would probably represent his endgame. Had   bombed spectacularly, or even progressed to the latter stages while failing to excite the nation, he would have recognised he had outstayed his welcome after six years in charge. And if the Three Lions had lifted\u00a0the trophy, there is no doubt that he would have waved a fond farewell, bathed in glory. The only scenario which would have tempted him to stay was one such as this \u2014 glorious failure, the nagging sense of \u2018what might have been\u2019 and the tantalising prospect of what might be still to come at the Euros in Germany 18 months from now. Young players such as  ,  ,   and   enjoyed very good tournaments and they will be better still by the summer of 2024. So after four fearless, thrilling performances out of five here, including Saturday\u2019s loss to France\u2019s world champions,   is tempted to go again. Even in the immediate aftermath of England\u2019s elimination, as the exhaustion of tournament management hit home and the   wounded him, Southgate was level-headed. He knew he needed time to think properly about whether he still has the mental energy and supreme motivation to take the Three Lions through another qualifying campaign. Whether, after 13 years away from \u00a0club management, that is what he \u00a0truly wants. So as Southgate considers his future \u2014 and this is entirely his own decision, the FA and his players are desperate for him to stay \u2014 it is worth understanding that this was his starting point. Travelling over to  , Southgate\u00a0felt unpopular. Those howls from the Wolves, when England were marmalised 4-0 by\u00a0Hungary and then booed off by the Molineux crowd in June, were still\u00a0ringing in his ears. Days before that Nations League defeat, England\u2019s worst at home for almost a century, Southgate had been unusually prickly in the face of criticism, tired by the accusations of over-caution and negativity. A couple of tweets from Gary Lineker during the 1-1 \u00a0draw with Germany in Munich a week earlier had really stuck in his craw. Southgate, self-aware and emotionally mature, knows that every manager has a shelf life and he understood that public opinion was turning against him. So he was likely to quit after Qatar, take a break and hopefully find an appealing club job next summer. And while there will always be pub bores and keyboard warriors demanding Southgate is axed, the England boss left Qatar with renewed respect from most. Yes, just like the Golden Generation, England lost in the quarter-finals to the first world-class team they encountered. But this felt different. It was, as Southgate recognised, England\u2019s best performance against elite opposition during his time in charge. Had Kane equalised with that penalty, the Three Lions had an excellent chance to dethrone the world champions and even win the tournament. When he reviews England\u2019s campaign, both privately and in an FA debrief, Southgate will find plenty to persuade him to stay, a renewed boldness and \u00a0positivity, a sense of renewal for a regime which had threatened to turn stale. There is no credible, gettable English alternative to Southgate and the FA are loath to go for a foreign manager. Southgate is a loyal man, with a quiet patriotism, a keen sense of national duty, and a strong affinity with a group of players who hold him in great esteem. The FA are desperate for him to stay because he makes them look good. On and off the field, Southgate has restored pride in the England team after decades of farce \u2014 three good tournaments for a likeable team with a social conscience, guided by a thoroughly decent boss. There is no credible, gettable English alternative to Southgate and the FA are loath to go for a foreign manager having invested so much in St George\u2019s Park, their national hub, and their coaching pathways. One key factor in whether Southgate stays or goes will be the thoughts of his assistant, Steve Holland. Southgate regards them very much as a managerial duo, always referring to \u2018we\u2019 rather than \u2018I\u2019. They have been together for a decade and they complement each other \u2014 Southgate the good cop, Holland the bad cop, Southgate the man-manager and ambassador, Holland the tactician and disciplinarian. They are likely to end up in club management together whenever their England tenure ends. And while the England post is very much a full-time job for Southgate \u2014 as he is so invested in St George\u2019s Park and everything it represents \u2014 Holland is often frustrated by the lack of time he spends on the training pitch as an international coach. Yet how good a club job might Southgate, and Holland, actually get next year? Of the top jobs in the Premier League \u2014 the Big Six plus Newcastle \u2014 perhaps only Tottenham but that would depend on Antonio Conte leaving and Mauricio Pochettino not returning. A job abroad? Perhaps, but Southgate is not a globe-trotting multi-linguist like Roy Hodgson. So would he want to jack in \u00a0the chance of leading England at the \u00a0Euros for a fair-to-middling Premier League job? Because the truth is the FA can find no better manager than Southgate \u2014 and Southgate may find no better employer than the FA."},

{"title": "Tony Adams names his best XI of the World Cup and reveals \u2018annoying the hell out of Messi\u2019 is best way to stop him", "author": null, "date": "16 Dec 2022", "content": "IT\u2019S the question every football fan asks: How on earth do you stop Lionel Messi? Well, let me suggest annoying the hell out of him. Defenders used to make life as uncomfortable as possible for the opposition\u2019s star player and use whatever tactic they could get away with. Now it\u2019s all gone rather timid. I would have loved the challenge of trying to put the shackles on  . I\u2019d go up to him before the ball arrives, dig him in the ribs and pull his shirt, get on his nerves. And the voice helps, too. I don\u2019t hear enough players shouting. Scream at Messi, rattle him, shout \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you\u201d right in his ear. It can frighten the life out of a player and puts them off their guard. While it\u2019s borderline ungentlemanly behaviour, you\u2019ve got to use everything in your armoury. And, while it would take a brave manager to tell one player: \u201cYour job is to stop Messi today, nothing else,\u201d that could be the best way to do it.  might have to sacrifice someone just to sit on him. That player will probably get booked so, at half-time, you swap it and stick someone else on him. If he gets booked, put on a sub and let him do the job. We once went over to   with   and they had the genius in midfield, Glenn Hoddle. Our manager, George Graham, told Stewart Robson: \u201cWherever Hoddle goes, you follow him. Kick him off the park.\u201d Glenn was so good, he could open up doors but we came out on top and won. Of course, you can\u2019t kick players today but there are tactics which make it harder and get them frustrated. Me, Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira used to take it in turns to shadow the star player. We were like a tag team. Messi makes and scores goals, like my former team-mate Dennis Bergkamp. You think you\u2019ve got him and he just pokes it away from you like he\u2019s on the school field. He sucks you in and then goes, so you have to think of different ways to deal with him. If Messi gets a one v one, he\u2019s going to get the better of you. Mind you,   would probably get the better of you, too. So make sure you\u2019re not isolated and that you have help around you. Also, don\u2019t dive in. The great old Italian defender, Franco Baresi, made an art of pretending to tackle then pulling out of it. Messi dangles the carrot and makes the defender challenge before skipping away. But Baresi made to go for the carrot, then didn\u2019t take it. It was a double bluff. He would keep strikers on their toes and make them more worried about him than he was about them. A great defence and keeper will usually win you the   but there hasn\u2019t been one in Qatar. Think of Marcel Desailly and Laurent Blanc for France in 1998 or Italy in 2006. Coaches like me would show our team the Italian defensive unit and how it worked. How to defend crosses, the box, the lines. It was a masterclass in defending. Croatia\u2019s Josko Gvardiol was touted as the best defender at this World Cup before he got ripped to bits by Messi but he\u2019s only 20. I was at Euro 88 at a similar age and didn\u2019t have the tools for the job. I got turned inside out by the best player in the world at that time, Dutchman Marco van Basten. He scored a hat-trick as we lost 3-1 and it took me a while to recover and lay that demon to rest. There was some criticism of my performance and I had my tail between my legs when I got home and got chased out of Luton airport by the   supporters because I\u2019d had a shocking tournament. But I used it to my benefit and learned from it. I spoke to Jim Rosenthal, the TV reporter, afterwards and I told him we had a brilliant set of youngsters at Arsenal. I was a betting man then and bet him \u00a350 we\u2019d win the title. What do you know? We won the trophy at Anfield and the man who presented it to us was... Jim Rosenthal, who gave me my \u00a350. Gvardiol will grow from his experience as I did and come back stronger. He is a talent. It wasn\u2019t easy to pick a team of the tournament as I was really struggling at the back. Defenders are playing like individuals and there\u2019s not a defence nailing it as a unit. There\u2019s also been a lot of injuries which means players have chopped and changed. For instance,  \u2019s right wing-back, Achraf Hakimi of Paris Saint-Germain, was fantastic going forward but defensively he was all over the place, especially against his club-mate Mbappe. You have to say   was the defender who played Mbappe the best of anyone. Do I put   in my team because France have got there? I have but probably because there\u2019s no one else. Goalkeepers Dominik Livakovic and Yassine Bounou were doing well but didn\u2019t have great semi-finals. It\u2019s easy to pick forwards for the best team because it\u2019s more an individual exploit anyway. But I couldn\u2019t get another Argentinian in my XI and they\u2019re in the final. Looking to that final, I do think France are the better team \u2014 and we shouldn\u2019t forget the influence that the exceptional   has had for them. But I do not think the defending champions will be able to handle Messi and, hopefully, he will win it. Messi deserves it, he\u2019s incredible, an absolute magician who loves the game. Who\u2019d have thought I\u2019d be shouting for Argentina?"},

Morocco have created history by becoming the first African or Arab nation to reach the World Cup semi-finals. But eagle eyed fans have spotted something strange in their abbreviation. You may have noticed during the tournament that the Morocco abbreviation is MAR and not MOR, as you might expect. This is because of the large French influence in the country, whilst the official languages of the country are Arabic and Berber. The French word for Morocco is Maroc - and the abbreviation MAR is therefore used for sporting events and as the official country code."},

His death was unrelated to vaccination status. There was nothing nefarious about his death. \"While the world knew Grant as a great journalist, we knew him as a man who approached the world with openness and love.  \"Grant was an incredibly empathetic, dedicated, and loving husband, brother, uncle, and son who was our greatest teammate and fan.  \"We will forever cherish the gift of his life; to share his company was our greatest love and source of joy.  \"Grant curated friends from all cultures and walks of life, for whom he was a generous listener, an enthusiast, a champion of others.\" This comes after Wahl's brother Eric admitted he no longer suspects foul play behind his death. Eric   after he was denied entry by Qatar security forces to the   match between Wales and USA in the group stage. Wahl wasn't allowed in because he wore a pro-LGBTQ+ shirt and the authorities ordered him to remove it as homosexuality is illegal and even punishable by death in the Middle Eastern state. The American journalist was ultimately let in and received an apology by FIFA but later received death threats.  But Eric now appears to agree with the doctors' autopsy and doesn't believe he was murdered.  Wahl was one of the world's most prominent sports journalists having worked with Sports Illustrated and Fox News as well as a New York Times bestselling author that always focused on human rights."},

Baggio, who helped Italy finish third at the 1990 World Cup, needed to score his penalty in the USA 1994 final shootout against Brazil to keep Italy\u2019s hopes alive. But despite winning the Ballon d\u2019Or the previous year, Baggio ended up blasting his spot-kick over the bar to give Brazil their fourth World Cup win. Even to this day, Baggio admits he has not forgotten the moment he skied Italy\u2019s dreams wide. He said last month: \u201cI will never forget it. That was a childhood dream come true and then it ended in the most absurd fashion and I never got over it. \u201cThe people always showed me great love and affection, they understood my suffering, but I am very demanding with myself. \u201cI had a thousand opportunities to miss a penalty in my career, that was the one I really couldn\u2019t miss.\u201d"},

But their dream of ending their nation\u2019s   for soccer\u2019s Holy Grail is the only ray of hope for a country blighted by economic woes. Argentina has spent more time in  than almost any other nation since the 1950s and has had double-figure inflation for decades. The Argentine peso has also lost 30 per cent of its value in recent months and lack of cash reserves, foreign investment and confidence in President Alberto Fernandez\u2019s regime has sent  to that amazing rate of 88 per cent \u2014 with predictions it will top 100 per cent in the New Year.

Asked whether lifting the trophy was more important than tackling inflation, Labour Minister Kelly Olmos shrugged: \u201cWe must constantly work against inflation, but one month won\u2019t make a huge difference. \u201cWe want Argentina to be champions \u2014 the Argentine people really deserve some joy.\u201d Lawyer Nicolas Orellano \u2014 who also runs a wine business in Buenos Aires to help make ends meet \u2014 used all his savings and borrowed money from his girlfriend to go to Qatar.

Nicolas, 30, is now virtually penniless and is living in a bustling Argentine fan commune in Barwa Barahat Al Janoub, south of Doha, dubbed \u201cLittle Buenos Aires\u201d. Yesterday fans there were roasting a lamb donated by Argentina\u2019s ambassador to Qatar on a makeshift barbecue beneath a giant Messi banner as footy anthems blared from a loudspeaker. Nicolas said: \u201cI have no money and no idea how I\u2019ll get home but there is no way I can leave, now we\u2019re so close to seeing Lionel Messi lift the World Cup. \u201cOur politicians back home have let us down but our football team has not \u2014 they are the only hope we have. \u201cIt is a special kind of madness which brings us here when we have so little.  \"My girlfriend supports me and loaned me $500 (\u00a3410) when my cash ran out. \u201cBut I know some people who have sold their homes to find the money to travel to Qatar. \u201cThe people of Argentina are suffering but they love it that so many of us are here and are even donating money to us so we can stay and support the team. \u201cI still don\u2019t have a ticket for the final but would give anything and everything to be there, having been to five games so far \u2014 and I\u2019m sure we will win.\u201d Accountant and part-time meat trader Javier Mahmud, 36, had been struggling to save a deposit for his first home in Buenos Aires with partner of 15 years Carla Barletta, 34.

I feel completely safe because we are all fans together.\u201d Mauro Fernandez, 32, a chef from Buenos Aires, travelled from  via Madrid to get to Doha.  He said: \u201cI paid 400 US dollars (\u00a3328) for the Holland match and 600 (\u00a3492) for Croatia but I have run out of money. \u201cThey are asking more than 1,000 (\u00a3820) for the final ticket so I may have to watch it on a giant screen but I will go to Lusail, so I can be with the fans and see the players. \u201cFor me it is all about seeing Messi lift that trophy. I\u2019ve been here for ten days and I\u2019m not sure how I will get home. \u201cI know Messi is better than Mbappe, he is the best. \u201cThere will be 50,000 Argentina fans at the final, there are more flights coming in from Buenos Aires. Yesterday they were completely full.\u201d Gaston Didier-Lardet, 33, from San Luis, near the Argentine city of Mendoza, made the 12-hour, 6,500-mile flight from Australia, where he was working at a mine. He is now living in a low-rise block in the Argentine fan village, and said: \u201cThis is not the Sheraton but the atmosphere with the fans is just great. \u201cIt feels like home \u2014 we are surrounded by fans, we have barbecues and music. \u201cI am a Messi soldier \u2014 he is proof of total sacrifice. \u201cI\u2019ve got a ticket for the final and I am very lucky.

No one is completely sure whether it is superstition, a fashion statement or simply the jersey he feels most comfortable in. But brand Ronaldo does have a certain 'look' - and this includes the long-sleeve shirt. Potentially the turning point could've been the painful Euro 2004 and World Cup 2006 campaigns, both of which ended with Ronaldo in tears on the pitch. He wore short-sleeves in the next two international tournaments, which were a failure - before making the switch for Euro 2012, where Portugal once again crashed out in a semi-final.

Eagle-eyed viewers will have noticed the five-time Ballon d'Or winner wearing a long sleeve shirt in the first half and a short sleeve shirt in the second half.

The 2022   will be no different, with players knowing that if they pick up two yellow cards they will pick up a suspension. However, there is a cut-off point for yellow cards to help ease concerns of those who pick up an early yellow in the tournament. We have all the information regarding the rules and when yellow cards are reset during the 2022 World Cup. In short, no, yellow cards will not be cancelled after the group stages at the World Cup. If you pick up a second yellow for the tournament in the final match of the group, the player will miss the round of 16. The same goes for if a player picks up his second, or fourth, yellow of the tournament in the round of 16,  meaning that they would miss the quarter final. However, a player's record will be reset after the quarter final and before the semi final. This is to ensure that nobody will miss a World Cup final because of suspension due to an accumulation of yellows. Despite this, a red card in the semi finals would see a suspension in the last match if this were to be the case. This rule change will be a welcome one for  , who previously saw   miss the Italia 90' World Cup final due to picking up a yellow card against West German in the semi final. Thankfully, nobody will suffer this heartbreak in Qatar due to this rule being tweaked since 1990."},

The top scorer in  can challenge   for pace and has raked in more than \u00a3100million this year. And the 23-year-old powerhouse is so important to France that   begged him not to quit   for   this summer. But he is far from infallible. Booed at this year\u2019s   ceremony in Paris, the divisive young star has chinks in his armour, on and off the pitch.  has missed a couple of crucial penalties, including one that saw France crash out of Euro 2020. He has reportedly fallen out with teammates, developed a  -like superiority complex, demanded the use of private jets and has been accused of hypocrisy. Mbappe made several ethical stands while at the same time turning down the move to Real Madrid this summer, after Paris St Germain\u2019s Qatari owners \u2014 who are linked to alleged   \u2014 offered him \u00a3156million to stay at the club. This was a player who organised a national-team revolt against sponsorship by the fast food firm  and French gambling website BetClic. Such double standards tarnished the image of a sporting genius who, during the  , high-fived an anti- pitch invader from Russian protest group   \u2014 a gesture for which he deserved a lot of credit. Mbappe also gave all his earnings from that controversial tournament to charity. Prior to the even more tarnished  , he said: \u201cI want to be more than just the guy who shoots the ball and goes to his yacht and takes his money. \u201cSometimes people think I have to just play football. But I think not. I think the world has changed.\u2019\u2019 Mbappe was born in the troubled Parisian suburb of Bondy, to Cameroonian dad Wilfried, a football coach, and mum Fayza, a handball player of Algerian heritage. At six Mbappe witnessed disaffected youths torching patrol cars as they rioted against police harassment. But his parents knew from early on that their son had the talent to escape such problems. By the time he was 11 a host of top teams wanted him to join their youth sides, with Real Madrid and   among them. He had a trial for   three years later, but the club wanted him to return for a second try-out because they weren\u2019t convinced by his willingness to defend. Mbappe\u2019s forceful mum Fayza, now 48, reportedly told the scout: \u201cMy boy won\u2019t be coming back. If they want him, they have to take him now or in five years\u2019 time they will be coming back to buy him for \u20ac50million (\u00a343million).\u201d And some say that insult still rings in his ears today. A family friend said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that Kylian himself has a bit of a downer on what was said about him in England all those years ago. \u201cThis might well give him a bit of extra  \u201d With the Premier League ruled out, in 2015 Mbappe\u2019s dad, now acting as his agent, decided he should sign with Monaco instead \u2014 which happens to be a tax haven. The young star received a signing bonus of \u00a3345,000. Five years ago his mum almost convinced him to sign for  because she was a fan of the Merseyside team, but instead he decided to join PSG in France for \u00a3166million.\u00a0 Leaked documents revealed Mbappe asked for 50 hours of private plane use every year as part of the deal. In Paris he showed how quick he could be, clocking up speeds of 23mph during one match. That\u2019s very close to the 26mph that   reached in his world record-breaking 100m sprint in 2009. But what turned Mbappe into a global sports star at the age of 19 was when he became only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final, when  . He was named the young player of the tournament for his four-goal tally. After that, Mbappe was linked to a string of models such as French beauty Emma Smet and Belgian catwalk star  , but he preferred not to talk about his love life. That is perhaps understandable, given the vile abuse he received from rival fans at this World Cup. Argentinian supporters in Qatar made rude references to him and a transgender model called Ines Rau, with whom he was spotted at the Cannes Film Festival this summer. Mbappe has spent a fortune on a string of flash cars, including two Ferraris, and a huge apartment in Paris. At the same time he has set up a charitable foundation that aims to help 98 children \u2014 a nod to his birth year, 1998 \u2014 to achieve their dreams in fields such as maths. He also congratulated England star   on his efforts to give more free school meals to British children. But that campaigning streak has caused tension during this World Cup. Mbappe did not want to be photographed near the tournament sponsor Budweiser\u2019s logo because he disapproves of alcohol and he has refused to give media interviews. Such demands would perhaps have more impact if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Paris St Germain are bankrolled by Qatar. The oil and gas-rich nation has been criticised for locking up homosexuals and treating foreign workers so poorly that more than 6,000 are estimated to have died while working on the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. Mbappe has not uttered a word against his club\u2019s paymasters, who view him as their poster boy. This year he has also been caught up in an explosive row between France teammate   and his brother Mathias. There were wild claims by Mathias that midfielder Paul had used a witch doctor to put a curse on Mbappe. Mathias tweeted to Mbappe: \u201cIt\u2019s never good to have a hypocrite and a traitor near you.\u201d There are also rumours that Mbappe has lobbied against the tactics at PSG, who again failed to reach this year\u2019s Champions League final, and campaigned for Brazilian superstar teammate Neymar to leave.\u00a0 When Mbappe missed a penalty in August the pair argued after another spot-kick was awarded by the referee. Legendary French midfielder Emmanuel Petit hit out at Mbappe, saying: \u201cHe annoys everyone today. He makes it personal all the time.\u00a0 \u201cHe even puts himself above the institution. Has everything that has happened in recent months gone to his head?\u201d\u00a0 The youngster denies interfering in team affairs, saying: \u2018\u2019That\u2019s not my job. I don\u2019t want to do this because I\u2019m not good at it. I\u2019m good on the pitch.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t deny is wanting to join Real Madrid and holding contract negotiations with the   title holders. That led to him being barracked by PSG fans on more than one occasion. But Macron rang the star striker to change his mind. The President told him: \u2018I want you to stay. I don\u2019t want you to leave now. You are so important for the country.\u2019 Throughout the protracted negotiations Mbappe has his mum standing in his corner. After one journalist dared to say her son had reneged on the Real deal, she tweeted to him: \u2018When we don\u2019t know, we shut up.\u2019 Coming into this World Cup he certainly had a lot to prove. His tame spot kick in a crucial shoot-out against Switzerland in the Euros last summer meant that France crashed out. Understandably, Mbappe was outraged by the racist hatred he received for missing the penalty. So much so he even considered quitting the national side, saying: \u201cI cannot play for people who think I\u2019m a monkey\u201d. In Qatar, Mbappe has shut up his critics and the bigots. Having scored five goals in this tournament, including two unstoppable efforts against Poland this week, the forward now has netted nine times at a World Cup. That\u2019s more than legends Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. It\u2019s not surprising that France\u2019s sports newspaper L\u2019Equipe had a headline ahead of the quarter-final against Gareth Southgate\u2019s side declaring \u201cGod save Notre King\u201d alongside a photo of Mbappe. On Saturday, England fans will be praying that our goalie Jordan Pickford does the saving. \n"},

Roads in Ras Laffan have even been flooded due to the sudden and highly-unusual deluge. Ras Laffan is less than half an hour's drive from Al Khor stadium, the most northern of the World Cup venues.

Six-times-married Zaina, 67, who describes Omar as \u201cmy soul mate\u201d, tells me he suffers from \u201cvery bad trauma, stress and panic attacks\u201d. Omar\u2019s torment over his father \u2014 Zaina thinks he suffered   after   \u2014 led him to consult therapists and be prescribed medication. Zaina once said: \u201cOmar loves and hates Osama at the same time. He loves him because he is his father but hates what he has done.\u201d Omar left Afghanistan in April 2001, just five months before al-Qaeda crashed passenger jets into New York\u2019s Twin Towers,  . Recalling his last conversation with his father, he revealed: \u201cI said goodbye and he said goodbye.  \"I\u2019d had enough of that world. He wasn\u2019t happy that I was leaving.\u201d They would never speak again. Omar was in Qatar on May 2, 2011 when he heard the news that US Navy Seals had   at a Pakistan safehouse. He shed no tears for his slain father.  He recognised the dead body of   Khalid from pictures on the internet of the stormed compound in the city of Abbottabad. His brow furrowed, Omar revealed: \u201cI thought everything was finished and that I\u2019m not going to suffer any more.  \"And I was mistaken, because people still judge me today.\u201d He would have liked a funeral, for closure.  The official US account is that Bin Laden\u2019s body was buried at sea from the supercarrier USS Carl Vinson within 24 hours of his death. Omar is doubtful, adding: \u201cIt would have been much better to bury my father and know where his body is.  \"But they didn\u2019t give us the chance. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they did to him. They say they threw him in the ocean but I don\u2019t believe that.  \"I think they took his body to America, for people to see.\u201d Omar\u2019s artwork, which he sells for up to \u00a38,500 apiece, is therapy \u2014 for his father\u2019s menacing shadow still hangs over him. Bin Laden\u2019s fourth eldest son, Omar was born in   to 6ft 4in Bin Laden\u2019s first wife, Najwa, in March 1981.  In 1991 Bin Laden was banished from Saudi Arabia for his anti-US diatribes after forming   to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in 1988. The family moved to  , north Africa, where many of Bin Laden\u2019s jihadi fighters worked in his farming and road-building businesses. Omar \u2014 who has been denied entry to Britain \u2014 shows me his vivid painting of his father\u2019s sunflower crop fringed by high mountains in Sudan. The US accused Bin Laden Senior of running terrorist training camps in Sudan, where the authorities asked him to leave. By May 1996 he was back in the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan, choosing 15-year-old Omar to accompany him. The teenager became his tea boy, living in freezing huts and on meagre rations. He was later joined by his mother and siblings. \u201cI was in Afghanistan for five years,\u201d he said. Omar learned to fire a Kalashnikov rifle and to drive a Russian tank, but he was disgusted when the fanatics started killing his pets to test chemical weapons. He once recalled: \u201cMy father never asked me to join al-Qaeda, but he did tell me I was the son chosen to carry on his work. \u201cHe was disappointed when I said I was not suited to that life.\u201d When asked today why he thinks his father chose him as his heir, he tells me: \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe because I was more intelligent, which is why I\u2019m alive today.\u201d I\u2019m speaking to Omar in his studio in a rambling villa in Qatar, where he and Zaina \u2014 who live in Normandy, France \u2014 are on a short break. He bears a striking resemblance to his infamous father, with a long, broad nose, but his eyes lack the al-Qaeda warlord\u2019s sinister glint. Omar and Zaina attended Qatar\u2019s final   group game against the Netherlands on Tuesday, an experience he described as \u201camazing\u201d. He tells me his father also enjoyed the sport, though he says of rumours that Bin Laden Senior was an   fan: \u201cI never heard him say he liked this team or that team.\u201d Omar supports the World Cup being held in Qatar, saying: \u201cArab people are human too. Qatar is one of the greatest countries in the Middle East. \u201cThey should have the right to invite the rest of the world to celebrate the World Cup here.\u201d On the face of it the son of history\u2019s most infamous terrorist and the former Cheshire parish councillor 25 years his senior are an odd couple. Yet they seem joyful in each other\u2019s company, with Omar at one point serenading her with Queen\u2019s Love Of My Life as we talk. Zaina, an accomplished artist too, is a mum of three who once worked in interior design for light aircraft and later for the Citizens Advice Bureau after doing a psychology degree. The great grandmother of three says: \u201cMy boys love Omar.\u201d She met him while horse riding near the Great Pyramid, in Giza, Egypt, in 2007 and they married soon after. In 2010 they attempted to have a child together through   but the British surrogate mum miscarried their twins at ten weeks. Today the couple are renovating flats in a 500-year-old building in Normandy to turn into holiday lets. They also plan to open a restaurant. Once indoctrinated by his anti-American father, Omar now loves McDonald\u2019s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Clint Eastwood movies.  An anglophile, he dreams of visiting Zaina\u2019s family in Britain. After the Queen died he made a video tribute on Tik Tok, saying: \u201cI loved  .  \"People come and go and she was always there.   is very kind and welcoming to Arabic and Gulf people especially.\u201d Two years ago Omar was denied entry to Britain after the couple arrived by ferry at Portsmouth. He said: \u201cWhen I put my foot on English soil they took us straight away to the questioning room for many hours.  \"But they were very kind and very respectful.\u201d The couple were sent back to France when Omar\u2019s paperwork was found not to be in order. He is now applying for a British visa. He hopes this interview will help him sell paintings. After our chat, his landscape of Tora Bora is finished \u2014 and signed OBL with a flourish. Asked if his infamous last name has helped him sell his artwork, Omar adds: \u201cMy name has helped me very much.  \"It\u2019s very well known around the world.\u201d Finally, I ask if he still loves his father, and he replies: \u201cFamily will always be family, no matter what.\""},

The 2010 finalists are on four points from two games, but are yet to hit top gear so far in the tournament.

The Dutch have underwhelmed so far and will have to play far better if they want to go deep in the competition. Regardless, they should have far too much here for the hosts, with Cody Gakpo surely licking his lips at the prospect of adding to his tally.  A poor showing against Ecuador had them facing an early exit on the opening day of the tournament. They were slightly better and scored their first ever World Cup goal against Senegal, but they surely need a miracle to avoid losing here. \u00a0Memphis Depay was introduced at half-time against Ecuador, but his lack of game-time could see him benched once again. In his pre-match press conference, Van Gaal said: \"We are not taking any risks with Memphis.\" \u00a0The hosts have no fresh injury concerns from Friday, but might be tempted to draft Mohammed Muntari into the team after his goal against Senegal. \u00a0Considering he's scored in both games and was one of the most in-form players in Europe ahead of the tournament, Gakpo is the standout danger man for Holland. But from midfield, Barcelona ace   has also impressed and was named man of the match in their opener. They've registered just two shots on target in three hours of action, so they're not exactly stacked with quality. But Muntari took his goal brilliantly, so Virgil van Dijk and Co will have to be wary of his aerial threat. It's simple for Netherlands, avoid defeat and they're through, but they'll also qualify for the last-16 if Ecuador beat Senegal. In terms of winning the group, they will secure top spot if they win and outscore Ecuador or if they draw and the other game is a draw. If them and Ecuador both win, it'll come down to goal difference. As for Qatar, they're already out and will need a huge victory to avoid finishing bottom of the group. Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering Qatar aren't in Europe and have never qualified for a World Cup previously, the game at the Al Bayt Stadium will be their first ever meeting between the sides."},

He moved up to the first team under Andre Villas-Boas in 2011 and has been assistant manager there, and even took charge on a caretaker basis\u00a0for the Premier League fixture against Sunderland when Jose Mourinho left in December 2015. In August 2013, Holland was appointed assistant manager to the new England Under 21s manager Gareth Southgate, working alongside his duties at Stamford Bridge. But following the appointment of Southgate as the caretaker of the England national football team on 27 September 2016, when Sam Allardyce resigned after one game due to an ongoing scandal,  . The 46-year-old left his role with the Blues to join the international setup full-time. Southgate said: \"If we want to be successful then we have to employ the best people and for me, Steve is the best.\" The main man is of course former Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough defender Southgate, who got the job full time in November 2016. Holland will also be working with goalkeeping coach Martyn Margetson. The Welsh former Manchester City stopper joined the setup in August, having been poached from Wales' national team by Allardyce. One man Holland won't be working with is former assistant boss, and long-time friend of Allardyce Sammy Lee, who Southgate ousted as he builds his own setup."},

Iran are second in the group as they hold advantage of the US - and could progress to the knockout stage for the first time in their six appearances at the World Cup. But after seemingly caving into pressure to sing the Iranian national anthem ahead of their game against Wales, there are chilling reports that the regime is threatening the players' families.  It is claimed the players were called into a meeting with members of the   (IRGC) - the shadowy religious army at the right-hand of the Ayatollah. The players were told their families would face \"violence and torture\" if they didn't sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against Tehran, reports  .  Dozens of IRGC officers are allegedly on the ground in Qatar to monitor the players - who are banned from mingling outside the squad or meeting with foreigners.  \u201cThere are a large number of Iranian security officers in Qatar collecting information and monitoring the players,\u201d the source said. Iranian players had reportedly been offered \"presents and cars\" ahead of their game with England. But after they stood silent during the national anthem - the attitude of their IRGC handlers quickly changed to threats of violence.

Political dissent is a\u00a0 \u00a0- and is one of the offences subject to capital punishment, with 21 protesters already facing execution after sham trials since the start of the uprising in September. Iranian officials had already been discussing cracking down on perceived disrespect to their national anthem and flag ahead of the World Cup. And the courts have been taking a brutal line on people linked to the protests, with more than 15,000 people arrested and hundreds killed by the security forces. And just last month, teenager Asra Panahi was beaten to death after she reportedly refused to sing a pro-government anthem. State news agencies also reported just ten days ago an Iranian cleric during prayers called on athletes who disrespect the anthem to face punishment. Iran's current president is Ebrahim Raisi - who is known as \"The Butcher\" for his role in the massacre of thousands of protesters in 1988.

Iran could seek to lash out abroad and step up their terrorist activity - especially with the world's eyes on the   in  .  The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) -an opposition group which advocates the overthrow of the regime -has warned Iran has stepped up its terrorist activities.  It warned there is a whole network of proxies- \"not only ready but functioning\" spread across the globe. The network has sprawling tendrils especially in the Middle East.  But the regime has also carried out terror attacks or major terrorist operations in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and many others.  All of these are overseen by the military group known as the Quds Force, watched over by the powerful and fanatical   (IRGC). The Quds Force - once headed by General   before he was   - reports directly to the supreme leader of fundamentalist regime, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is estimated the force is up to 20,000 strong and is understood to be responsible for supporting and training proxy groups worldwide. And they could have the World Cup in their brutal sights.  Top spy chief Major General Aharon Haliva warned last week that Tehran could use the tournament to cause carnage. He said the only thing stopping the Iranians was fears of how Qatar could react to such a provocation. \"I am telling you that the Iranians are now considering attacking the World Cup in Qatar as well,\" said Maj. Gen Haliva.  His warning came after the head of MI5, Ken McCallum, named Iran as a major security threat to the UK - with ten foiled plots to kidnap or kill people in Britain in 2022.  In a terrifying warning to the West, the PMOI spokesman Shahin Gobadi, said that part of the terrorist group's tactics is taking Westerners as hostages to later use as \"leverage against Europe.\" It\u2019s not a secret the regime has created, financed harboured, trained and armed all sorts of terrorist groups across the world He told The Sun Online: \"As the regime is getting bigger it resorts to more and more repression at home and terrorism abroad- one part is taking westerns as hostages. \"In order to keep the ship at bay and maintain the balance, they have resolved to more executions at home, to more terrorism abroad, to more support for extremist groups abroad and more repression at home. \u201cRunning proxies has been a part impartial of this strategy.  \"It\u2019s not a secret the regime has created, financed harboured, trained and armed all sorts of terrorist groups across the world. \"The regime\u2019s tentacles have reached not only Europe but also the States, in Latin America, Africa- so basically all the continents. \u201cThis regime recognises no borders when it comes to terrorism and more and more Westerners are becoming targeted.\" Gobadi states that taking hostages has been part of the regime's strategy for years, as a shield for its terror operations describing it as a \"pattern.\"   A report released by PMOI and shared with The Sun Online reveals how Iran's policy has developed and spread across the West over the years. In the aftermath of the Iranian 1979 revolution the new regime \"gradually learned to develop a strategy of hostage-taking and terrorism to achieve one goal: spreading warfare abroad to preserve an illegitimate rule at home.\" The report notes there is \"hardly any\" major European country Iran has neither attacked nor established a base.   It points out that Iran has used non-Iranian and especially Arab proxy militants to attack foreign targets. Gobadi notes that the situation has worsened in the past year since hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi rose to power.  Raisi, known as\u00a0 ,   became Iran's President last June after winning \u00a050 per cent of the 29million votes. \u201cAppointing him as the president signals the fact the regime is bound to more terrorism and more repression,\" Gobadi said. Gobadi has also warned that the West is in danger if it doesn't adapt its response stating that Iran's priority is to \" step up repression and terrorism abroad, to intensify its drive to acquire nuclear weapons and increase its ballistic missiles arsenal.\" He continued: \u201cProducing sanctions with the regime would be totally counter-productive as it would simply feed this apparatus. \u201cThere should be a warning to the West. The West should adapt its response proportionately. \u201cIf it provides incentives to the regime not only sends the wrong signal but simply facilitates this kind of misconduct which endangers the security of our Europeans and our Westerners. \"It\u2019s about time European countries put aside all these illusions hoping this way by providing concessions and offering concessions you can change the conduct of the regime or make it much more civilized or a more normal state- to the contrary.\" And while it seeks to expand its influence and spread chaos, Iran has been suffering back at home.

Violence broke out off the field during a tense game as   eventually inspired   at the Lusail Stadium on Saturday night.  Shocking footage showed   and Mexico fans lunging at each other as stunned stewards struggled to step in.  The group of violent spectators were seen clambering over stadium seats and swinging\u00a0wild blows at each other. Video of the punch-up appeared to show an Argentina fan lurching forwards to attack a rival supporter before a man wearing a Mexico top joined in the scrap and repeatedly punched him in the face. Horror footage showed the Argentina supporter hunched over a seat gasping for breath as blood poured from his face before security guards escorted him away.  A man who claimed he was a pal of the bloodied Argentinian later posted a photo of his injuries online. The pic showed cuts on his face and dried blood on his neck and top. \"He\u2019s a friend of mine, this is how they left him,\" the pal said. It's not clear if any arrests have been made after the brawl.  Mexico\u2019s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Marcelo Luis Ebrard Casaubon, said no Mexican nationals had been arrested. He said: \"The Qatar government informs me no Mexicans have been arrested during the World Cup so far. Good!!\" There were pre-match reports of violent clashes between fans of the two South American footballing nations as Argentina were under huge pressure to win. Supporters from the two sides clashed on Wednesday night in a fan zone in Qatar.  Mexicans filmed themselves chanting \"f**k Messi\" before the fans ended up coming to blows.  in their first group game was arguably the biggest shock in World Cup history. And only three points against Mexico would have left\u00a0qualification in their own hands. Ultimately Messi fired a brilliant opener on 64 minutes despite being\u00a0as quiet as most of his other team-mates before that. And sub\u00a0Enzo Fernandez curled an even better goal late on to seal three points. Even now, though, Argentina must beat unbeaten group leaders Poland on Wednesday to reach the last 16. And they will surely need a much more accomplished display than they have produced so far in Qatar to squeeze through."},

Cody Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong were the scorers as the Dutch dominated Qatar in their final group game. And the Netherlands could face England NEXT if the Three Lions finish second in their group. Follow ALL of the latest updates below... That's all from Qatar So, the Dutch top group A and will face the runners-up in group B, which in theory, could be just about anyone! In the meantime, I've heard there is something going on between a Saint and a dragon this evening... Thanks for reading. Goodbye! Midfield maestro Frenkie De Jong was at the heart of everything his country did well this afternoon. The Barcelona man pulled the strings from midfield and capped his performance off with his side's second goal of the game. Could this be the tournament where we see the very best from De Jong? Golden Gakpo That's how to put yourself on the map. Cody Gakpo was amongst the goal again today, taking his tally to three goals in three games at the tournament. With interest flooding in from the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal, the 23-year-old will have earned himself even more admirers this afternoon. Job done The Dutch are the first team through to the knockout stages! It was by no means a classic, but a deserved win against hosts, Qatar. Group A standings Senegal have held out to win against Ecuador, and they will march on to the knock-out rounds. Incredible scenes in Doha! SunSport's Neil Custis has this report from the Al Bayt Stadium. CODY GAKPO is becoming one of the stars of this World Cup and could be heading for the Golden Boot. Many Dutch fans felt they would struggle for goals with Memphis Depay unable to start the opening two games. But PSV Eindhoven\u2019s Gakpo has filled the gap with three in as many games. In so doing he has joined exulted company as only the fourth Dutch player to do so at a World Cup after Johan Neeskens (1974) Dennis Bergkamp (\u201994) and Wesley Sneijder (2010). His goals have helped the Dutch march into the knockout phase largely untroubled as Group A winners. To think Manchester United could have got the 23-year-old for \u00a340million in the summer but instead kept that money to fund the Antony deal which cost twice as much. Leeds will also be ruing the fact that the player pulled out of a move to Elland Road late in the day as well and decided to stay at PSV. His strike against Qatar broke the deadlock here at the Al Bayt Stadium in the 26th minute and it was a cracking slick move to that led to it. There had been question marks over why wing-backs Daley Blind and Denzel Dumfries had not been getting more involved in the opening two games. But Blind was constantly part of anything good the Dutch did in the first period. It was he who found Memphis Depay who moved it on to Gakpo and he played a slick one-two with Davy Klaassen before executing another fine finish curling the ball beyond the goalkeeper's outstretched arm in to the far bottom corner. In their opening group win over Senegal he stole in to nick a header home to break that deadlock and was on the mark with a scorching shot after just six minutes against Ecuador. Memphis was starting his first game here in Qatar after being used as a sub previously following a long lay-off with a hamstring injury. He was pushing to make up for lost time and after a Frenkie de Jong shot in the 15th minute hit Klaassen he hooked the rebound over the bar. Qatar did have some moments to lift the home crowd not least in the opening moments when some loose play from the Dutch saw Abdulaziz Hatem have a long-range shot but it was straight at the goalkeeper. Successive corners around the 20 minute mark also raised expectations but they would come to nothing. As coach Felix Sanchez said before the game they are just lagging behind at this level and in losing they would become the first hosts to finish a tournament pointless. Holland added a second through De Jong four minutes after the break. Klaassen\u2019s cross flicked off a Qatari head in a packed penalty area and found it\u2019s way to Memphis at the far post. He controlled the ball superbly and shot from close range but was denied by a fine point-blank save by Meshal Barsham. De Jong was following in to gobble up the loose ball and fire it into the roof of the net. A player who looked pale and ill with a sore throat the day before was now beaming from ear to ear. The Qatari crowd in AL Bayt now silent. Holland thought they had a third when subs Steven Berghuis and Vincent Janssen who ha djust come on combined but it was ruled out after a VAR intervention for a handball by Gakpo in the build up. Louis van Gaal\u2019s dream of bowing out in his third term as Dutch coach as World Champion very much alive. FULL-TIME - Netherlands 2-0 Qatar The whistle is blown as Qatar bow out of their home tournament. The Dutchman progress as group winners. It was a relatively comfortable afternoon for Van Gaal's men who got the job done. They will play the runners-up of England's group. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 90+3, Barsham plucks Dumfries' cross out of the air. He's done himself no harm this afternoon.  The Qatar keeper has looked pretty solid on the whole. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 90+2, Berghuis rattles the bar! That's what we needed. the substitute shifts it onto his favoured left before curling a fantastic shot against the upright. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 90, There will be six added minutes here. I'm sure most of us could do without it, the game has slowed right down. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 86, Changes for both sides. Alaaeldin and Kohoder are on for Hatem and Mohammad, who have been Qatar's best outlooks at wing-back. Taylor will get a run-out for the Dutch. Goal scorer De Jong departs. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 84, Weghorst, who was brought on just minutes ago, chests the ball down before playing in Berghuis. The flag is then raised for offside against the former Burnley man.  Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 82, Qatar are having their best spell of the game. Muntari stretches for the ball in between Van Djik and Blind, but is judged to have fouled the Liverpool man. Louis van Gaal will be praying his players stay fit now. It's operation preservation for the Dutch in this last ten minutes or so. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar A crowd of 67,000 is announced over the tannoy. Looking at the empty seats, i wonder if they're telling porkies. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 79, Ali is slipped in behind and flashes an effort across goal, forcing Noppert to intervene, taking it off the toes of Muntari. Nice play by Qatar. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 76, Hatem lines up the shot but didn't catch it at all, sending a weak low drive, gratefully received by Noppert in goal, who has had very little to do this afternoon.  Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 74, Senegal have scored a few miles down the road. They are now heading through to the knockout stages... crazy scenes! Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 73, Dumfries sends in a cross which takes a nick of Hasan and forces Barsham into a decent stop at his near post. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 72, Elsewhere in group A, Ecuador have equalised... As it stands, Ecuador will go through behind Netherlands. GOAL DISALLOWED - Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 69, The goal is chalked off after the VAR review. Gakpo was judged to have used his arm to control the ball before rolling a pass through to Janssen. The substitute had the simplest of tasks of squaring it to fellow substitute Berghuis who rolled it home. Far too easy, and Qatar get away with one. GOAL! - Netherlands 3-0 Qatar 67, The substitutes combine to make it three! But VAR are taking a look... The referee is checking for a handball in the build-up. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 66, Van Gaal makes a double change. Memphis Depay is withdrawn after 65 minutes of action. Fans will be pleased to see him back fit after injury. Klaassen also makes way. Janssen and Berghuis are on. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 64, Felix Sanchez makes a triple change. Last week's goal scorer Muntari is on, along with Boudiaf and Assadalla. Al Haydos, Ali and Madibo are off. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 60, Felix Sanchez throws his water bottle to the floor in frustration. He will know that 2-0 perhaps flatters Netherlands amid calls for him to be sacked. Netherlands 2-0 Qatar 59, Hasan gets to the by-line, but once again there is a distinctive lack of white shirts in the penalty area. The Qataris move it well again and Mohammad's cross in is over everyone."},

During the live broadcast of the   and   game, CCTV Sports replaced close-up shots of maskless fans waving flags with images of players, officials or the football stadium.

Footage of the   on Saturday also emerged showing a stark difference between the state TV's version of the game and other broadcasts.  CCTV Sports kept the camera on players on the pitch and officials on the sidelines while the other broadcast zoomed in on fans reacting to the game.  And in a video shared of the  , the crowd appeared to be blurred in one version of the broadcast.  Tens of millions of people in major cities in   - including the capital   - are currently under some form of lockdown as   cases rise across the country.  China is the last major economy still trying to stamp out the spread of Covid with  , lengthy quarantine rules and mass testing regimes. But the contrast of the harsh restrictions with the raucous World Cup crowds has infuriated many living in China.  The images of maskless fans in Qatar have highlighted to many frustrated Chinese the difference between their country's Covid curbs and a world that has moved on from masks and lockdowns. An open letter to China's National Health Commission questioned the country's Covid policies and asked if China was \"on the same planet\" as Qatar. It went viral online last Tuesday before being deleted. One Weibo user fumed: \"My biggest takeaway from watching the World Cup: no one is wearing a mask, and no one is afraid of the pandemic!\" \"How long will the policies keep us in lockdown? Are we not the same species with those from the rest of the world?  \"Are we closing off the entire country from the world now?\" Another said: \"The Qatar world cup tells us that the rest of the world has returned to normal. \"It's not sustainable for us to maintain this state of shutdown.\" State broadcaster CCTV spent millions of dollars on the rights to broadcast the event - even though China has not qualified for the competition since 2002.

Hundreds have taken to the streets across major cities in\u00a0China\u00a0after the tragedy was blamed on\u00a0 \u00a0draconian\u00a0zero-Covid lockdown. From\u00a0Beijing\u00a0to\u00a0 , the deaths have led to protests across China and cops have descended onto the streets to keep order as tensions boil over. The deadly blaze at the apartment block in Urumqi on Thursday sparked outrage as the city has been under strict Covid restrictions since August. Furious residents have blamed the deaths on the Covid lockdown as they said they were only allowed to leave home for short periods each day and the timing was strictly controlled by authorities. Footage also showed workers trying to take down fences near the building, delaying firefighters and emergency services from getting to the scene and helping victims. Thousands took to social media to question whether residents had been trapped in the building - and whether the fire exits had been blocked. Urumqi authorities issued an unusual apology on Friday night and confirmed lockdown measures would be eased \"in stages\" after the blaze. And on Sunday, Beijing appeared to acknowledge the tragedy as authorities reportedly issued a notice stating it is \"strictly forbidden\" to block fire exits in buildings under lockdown. But the deaths have sparked protests across China. People in Urumqi were seen confronting officials, breaking down a barrier and yelling \"end the Covid lockdown\". Protesters in Shanghai stood on police cars and others chanted \"we don\u2019t want PCR tests\" as a vigil was held in the city for the fire victims on Saturday night. The demonstrations are the latest signs of building frustration with Chinas intense approach to controlling Covid."},

The Qataris own 95 percent of the Shard as well as Harrods, and Paris Saint Germaine Football club and have shares in companies such as Porsche, Louis Vitton and Barclays.\u00a0 Whilst also snapping up rare million-pound supercars, stunning mega yachts and the best breed race horses as well as flying on their own VIP airline.  Not content with their lucrative investments, the family set about putting the country on the map by hosting some of the world\u2019s biggest sporting events.\u00a0 Qatar will hold the football World Cup this year and will host the Asian Games for the second time in 2030.\u00a0 The move was met with fury among human rights campaigners after the hosts have been dogged by protests over poor conditions for stadium workers and the criminalisation of same-sex relationships. The World Cup will see millions flock to the middle eastern country known for its crackdown on free speech and dissidents - with \u00a3173billion spent on infrastructure for the event.\u00a0 The ruling family is headed by the 42-year-old Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani - who is worth \u00a31billion alone.\u00a0\u00a0 Tamim took over from his father as the Emir of Qatar in 2013 after his brother renounced his claim to the title, while many of the family hold high-powered positions in the Government.  Most of the family's wealth comes from the Qatar Investment Authority, which controls oil and gas reserves and was set up by the state in 2005.\u00a0 With their earnings, the House of Thani has been able to purchase luxury homes all around the world including a stunning 43,000ft coastal mansion on the Doha coast.  The property's stunning interior comes complete with marble floors and is filled with 18th-century art from Sotherby's.  The royal also purchased what was once one of Britain\u2019s most expensive mansions - Dudley House.\u00a0 Located at 100 Park Lane, the \u00a3200 million property was nicknamed the \u2018Sheikh Shack\u2019 and even the Queen herself said the property made Buckingham Palace \u2018look dull\u2019. It is thought to have taken six years to carefully refurbish the 44,000sq ft, 17-bedroom palace. There is also a 50ft ballroom, stunning views across Hyde Park and an estimated \u00a3100m worth of furniture inside. Other properties include a stunning Paris residence with 15 rooms and another two homes on\u00a0London\u2019s exclusive Cornwall Terrace that they attempted to turn into a 'mega-mansion'.  Cornwall Terrace is believed to be the most expensive row of houses anywhere in the world.\u00a0 The family also has an impressive collection of private jets as well as a VIP airline that caters exclusively for them, Qatar Amiri Flight.  In 2018, their private jet, thought to be worth \u00a3500 million, was put up for sale with a dining room and medical room.  On the water, the Emir owns the luxurious Al Lusail superyacht worth a whooping \u00a3400 million.\u00a0 It has its own onboard beauty salon, a guest elevator and private cinema and was built a foot shorter than his father's yacht, The Katara, as a mark of respect.  The family is not short on supercars either with one Qatari royal transporting all his pricey motors to London for the summer.  Owned by the Emir\u2019s brother, Khalifa bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the collection included a McLaren P1 worth over a \u00a31million, a \u00a32million Bugatti Veyron and a Porsche 918 spyder.\u00a0 Pictures from 2016 show passersby stopping to gaze at the supercar collection in Knightbridge.  The Qatari prince, famous for his playboy lifestyle, caused a stir when he studied at the University of Southern California in 2011. He arrived on a private jet with a team of servants, chauffeurs, security, a nurse, a personal trainer and even a fixer.\u00a0 He frequented the Beverly Wilshire, the hotel that appeared in the movie Pretty Woman, and mixed with stars including Scott Disick from the reality show, Keeping up with the Kardashians.\u00a0 The 'heartthrob' prince was showered with special treatment arousing suspicions over the legitimacy of his degree, a report from the   alleged.\u00a0 The report claimed that he had been able to skip classes and gained his master\u2019s degree whilst never stepping foot on the campus and was allowed to study remotely.  The privilege had never been offered to anyone before or since the Prince's time there.   A professor also claimed that when the royal submitted his final paper, the documents were sent along with a Rolex watch. \u00a0 Questions over the Prince's college degree this was not the only scandal to rock the house of Al Thani.  In May this year, Qatari Prince Abdelaziz bin Khalifa Al Thani\u2019s ex-wife Kasia Gallanio was found dead in her  .\u00a0 Ms Gallanio 's death came after she claimed the former oil and finance minister for Qatar had touched a minor in an inappropriate way. The exiled Qatari, whose father was overthrown by his own brother in 1995, strongly denies the allegation. In an interview before her death, the former Qatari princess said that she was  and had 'no freedom' during her marriage.  An investigation by the Sunday Times in June also revealed that Prince Charles had had close dealings with the family.  King Charles, who was then the Prince of Wales, accepted three lots of cash from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani - totalling \u00a32million,  \u00a0 Clarence House said the money had been \u201cpassed immediately to one of the prince\u2019s charities who carried out the appropriate covenants and assured us that all the correct processes were followed\u201d.\u00a0 The prince\u2019s meetings with Sheikh Hamad did not appear in the Court Circular, the list of official engagements undertaken by working royals.

But now, Mr Al-Thawadi admitted the death toll could be as much as 167 times higher than this estimate. Piers quizzed him on the migrant worker deaths, during which he confessed as many as 500 people had died. \"The estimate is around 400 - between 400 and 500 - I don't have the exact number, that is something that is being discussed,\" Mr Al-Thawadi told TalkTV. Piers pushed him, saying that this amount of deaths was a \"big price to pay\". The official however said that health and safety standards have vastly improved since they won the World Cup.

Workers mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Philippines find themselves in a form of \"forced labour\". The kafala system ties workers visas to a sponsorship by their employer - who is responsible for their legal status. Migrants can end have to pay up to \u00a32,200 just to secure a job. And this is something that can lead to them emptying their savings or selling what little assets they have, only to them find themselves trapped in low paying jobs.

Eight years on, the Dragons suffered another agonising qualification failure in their final group game against Romania. The late Gary Speed won a penalty that was taken by Paul Bodin.

No, the controversial figure did not bite anyone despite having done so three times in his career, but he did have his say on the match. With Sulley Muntari putting Ghana ahead, Uruguay equalised through Diego Forlan before the match was sent to extra time. With penalties looming as the score remained level, Ghana were putting on the pressure and came close to scoring in the final minute of the match.

The PSG superstar, 35, named his favourite wonderkids for a Topps \u2018Lionel Messi Designed Set\u2019 card pack.  selected a hatful of young English talent among his crop - with no fewer than   Three Lions stars making the grade. But the 15 youngsters have endured very different years since Messi's announcement. Take a look at where they are now, one year on... MESSI got a first-hand view of the Liverpool right-back's talent in the 2018-19 Champions League. , 24, was in blistering form as the Reds thumped Barcelona 4-0 in the second-leg of their semi-final clash - and even took the corner leading to Divock Origi's winning goal to send them to the final. Still Liverpool's No1 right-back, Alexander-Arnold has faced criticism over his defensive ability in the last few seasons. However, he is still part of England's squad in Qatar looking for Wolrd Cup glory. LINKED with a move to Arsenal,   has captained Lyon and has already won caps for France. Technically superb, the versatile midfielder, 24, was expected to complete a big-money move to another of Europe's giants in 2021. However, a loss of form and questions about his temperament emerged and he failed to make the World Cup squad. A former team-mate of Messi, the Argentine knows all about De Jong. The Dutchman, 25, moved from Ajax following their run to the 2018-19 Champions League semi-final. While De Jong is yet to replicate his top form at the Nou Camp - time is certainly on his side. Man Utd thought so, anyway, and were desperate to sign him in the summer. However, he snubbed their offer - preferring to stay at Camp Nou. THE French striker, 26, joined Atletico Madrid on loan from Lyon with a view to a permanent move back in 2021. But, he failed to impress Diego Simeone - and was soon back to France. The ex-Fulham and Celtic forward was rated one of Europe's most-sought-after stars after a sensational three-year spell in France.  has scored 69 times in 159 matches in all competitions for Lyon. ANOTHER Atleti forward, Diego Simeone added Felix to his squad for a record \u00a3113million in 2019. But the 23-year-old has failed to live up to the hype expected of him. A poor return of 33 goals in 129 games and has meant Simeone is ready to cut his losses. Man Utd are one of the clubs that have been linked with the fallen wonderkid. THE Manchester City star, 22, is making a name for himself across Europe. As well as Messi,   has garnered praise from the likes of Arsene Wenger. Under Pep Guardiola, Foden has flourished and become a full international. The clamour for him to be England's main man at the World Cup was too much for Gareth Southgate to resist - and he inspired the Three Lions to a 3-0 win over Wales. AFTER Messi's comments, Havertz teased clubs across Europe by showing off his unquestionable talent at Bayer Leverkusen. After Chelsea opted to splash \u00a370m on the midfielder/forward,  , 23, was expected to take the next step. The German star has blown hot and cold for the Blues, showing glimpses of his talent - but never on a consistent level. SIGNED by Real Madrid from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2019, Jovic's career has really stalled. The Serbian, 24, scored just twice in 21 LaLiga games before being shipped back on loan to Frankfurt last year. Jovic scored twice off the bench in his first game back in the Bundesliga - but didn't exactly pull up trees. Los Blancos cut their losses in the summer - flogging him to Fiorentina where he has seven goals in all competitions this season. HARDLY a wonderkid at the time of Messi's revelation - Kimmich was already 25. The German feels like he's been around for a decade already and is easily one of the best players on the planet. The versatile star can play in midfield or at right-back and has already won 74 international caps, while helping Bayern Munich to a famous Treble last season. Kimmich was part of the Bayern team who trounced Messi's Barcelona 8-2 in the Champions League quarter-final, even getting on the scoresheet. QUITE possibly the best striker on the planet right now, Mbappe has scored a sensational 190 goals in 237 league games for Paris Saint-Germain. The 2018 World Cup winner, 22, was set to move to Real Madrid last summer, but snubbed the LaLiga giants for a bumper \u00a3300million contract with the French club. Now he is his country's greatest light at the World Cup in Qatar. HAVING moved to Real Madrid from Porto in the summer of 2019, huge things were expected of the Brazilian, who was handed a   contract. Militao, 24, has shown flashes of talent after breaking into the first team last campaign. But Militao can't dislodge Thiago Silva and Marquinhos in the Brazilian national team. A FUTURE Chelsea - and possibly even England - captain, Mount has been superb for the Blues. , 23, bizarrely seems to split fans - but has shown grit, determination and extraordinary talent in a struggling Chelsea team. The midfielder has gone from strength-to-strength since Messi comments. It's expected Mount will go on to forge an incredible partnership with the likes of Declan Rice, Jack Grealish, James Maddison and Phil Foden for England in what's increasingly looking like another 'Golden Generation'. MESSI was never going to leave the Bayern Munich man out of his list. After all, Pavard, 26, scored the goal of the tournament as France knocked Argentina out of the 2018 World Cup at the last-16 stage with a  . The versatile defender is now a regular in the Bayern XI, playing 140 Bundesliga games since joining from Stuttgart in 2019. DESPITE struggling with injuries, Pulisic has shown fans - and Messi - just what he can do. Chelsea always seem to look more dangerous with the American, 24, in the team.  has also led the USA's charge in Qatar. OF all the players on Messi's list, Sancho has arguably been the most disappointment. The Man Utd star, 20, was the subject of the longest-running transfer saga ever, seemingly in 2021.  eventually joined in a deal worth a staggering \u00a373million. But he has been a big disappointment at Old Trafford - which culminated in being dropped from Southgate's World Cup squad."},

The shyest of characters, you could lose Moriyasu in an elevator, but put him in a dressing room with a team under the cosh and he does the business time after time. On came Ritsu Doan and Kaoru Mitoma. By the 48 \u00a0minute, they were level. By the 51 \u00a0minute, they were ahead \u2013 the latter by the barest of margins. Against the Germans, it took Doan until the 75 \u00a0minute to equalise, yet he wasted no time here, cutting inside from a poor Unai Simon pass out from the back and firing goalwards.

I am reaping what I have planted over the years. \u201cBut for Brazil and the World Cup, it is not necessarily about being in your best moment at your (club) team but the best for the national team. \u201cThat\u2019s what I have done since 2003, when I was part of the Brazil squad for the first time. If I have to play the drum I will be the best drummer out there. That\u2019s how I see life. \u201cI know what I can do for the team.

{"title": "Brazil go against tradition with full backs Danilo and Alex Sandro concentrating on defending over attacking in Qatar", "author": null, "date": "6 Dec 2022", "content": "AS Cafu and Roberto Carlos sit up in the stands watching Brazil in the World Cup, they may well be reflecting that they do not have successors in the current team. pioneered the back four, unleashing it in a World Cup for the first time in 1958, when, with extra defensive cover, they did not concede a single goal until the semi final. Dropping an additional player into the heart of the defence had the effect of pushing the full backs out wider. They soon realised that they had a corridor of space in front of them that they could exploit. In that 1958 World Cup, Nilton Santos charged all the way up from left back to score a goal - something that was almost unthinkable at the time. The tradition was developed - who can forget  forward to seal the 1970 World Cup triumph with a blistering finish against Italy? The attacking full back became synonymous with Brazilian football. These players were more auxiliary wingers than proper defenders - and in that last World Cup win in 2002 Brazil ended up fielding three centre backs so that Cafu and   could have maximum freedom to bomb forward. . One of the most striking developments in recent years has been Brazil\u2019s developments of wide strikers. Centre forward has been a problem - one that Richarlison is currently solving. But they have more wide strikers than they know what to do with. This is reflected in the World Cup squad, where Antony and Gabriel Martinelli have to wait for their chance while Raphinha and   are on the team sheet. And if the team have genuine wingers, there is little need for full backs to duplicate the function. The role of the full back, then, has changed. Coach Tite makes this clear. He says that he is not looking for Liverpool full backs. Rather than the buccaneering wing play of   and Andrew Robertson, he wants Manchester City style players - full backs who may occasionally appear in the attacking line as an element of surprise, but whose basic role is to tuck in and make the extra man in midfield, hold the defensive line and also construct from deep. The switch in emphasis explains why it is not proving easy to fill the position. The first choices are the Juventus pair of Alex Sandro and Danilo - good players both, but hardly world beaters. And there is little strength in depth - hence the fact that 39-year-old Daniel Alves is  , and centre back Eder Militao is being improvised in the right back position. Brazil is not yet producing players who are tailor made for this new interpretation of the function. The role of full back is now much less glamorous and eye catching than it was in the days of Cafu, Roberto Carlos and countless others. But it is no less important. In the Qatar World Cup - and over the last few years - Brazil have shown a striking defensive solidity. That is despite playing a side with two wingers and a centre forward, plus   and Lucas Paqueta. Holding midfielder Casemiro is receiving a lot of credit for keeping the opponents at bay. It is well deserved, but it must also be shared with the defensive unit behind him, where the more defensive positioning of the full backs, for example, is a great aid to the 38-year-old legs of Thiago Silva. Should Brazil go on to lift World Cup number six, it is unlikely that in decades to come Danilo and Alex Sandro will be watching matches from the FIFA VIP lounge. But Brazil\u2019s Manchester City style full backs are still making an important contribution."},

Riot cops were deployed to push back a large crowd of fans who then became trapped against a chain link fence before the round of 16 kick off at the Education City Stadium. Harrowing video shows   fans of both teams stuck on a narrow pathway between a fence and a wall.  Screams of the fans and the barks of police dogs can be heard in the footage of the chaos.  Riot cops and security guards are seen at the end blocking the crowd's way and shoving the supporters back.  Other footage shows cops in helmets clashing with the fans.  Men, women and children could all be seen stuck in the crowd pressed against the fence.  Police lined up with riot shields as they corralled the fans waiting near the stadium.  Ahead of kickoff on Tuesday, security appeared tighter than at other games. Rows of riot police were deployed on the ground, drones were seen flying overhead, and cops were seen on horseback. Marshals at the stadium perimeter shouted \"show your tickets please\" at approaching fans and guards checked for tickets before letting them through.  A crowd of fans without tickets were waiting beyond the marshals. \"We hope to get in,\" said one man, who declined to give his name. Moroccan fans are some of the most numerous of any team left at the world cup.  Many of them live and work in   and were hoping to see their team advance to its first quarter-final. While Morocco, in the last 16 for the first time since 1986, were the underdogs, the support of their vociferous, red-clan fans has been seen as a big asset in the first World Cup hosted by an Arab state. \"Atlas Lions carry hopes of a whole continent,\" the Moroccan newspaper Maroc Le Jour declared in a front-page headline. The match may gain piquancy from the familiarity of the opponents. The   mainland is visible from   across the Strait of Gibraltar and thousands of Moroccans live there for work. As a colonial power, Spain controlled swathes of northern Morocco as well as the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which Rabat sees as its own, and still retains two small North African enclaves at Ceuta and Melilla that Rabat says it should quit. Diplomatic ties improved this year after Morocco had withdrawn its ambassador to Spain in 2021 in a dispute over Madrid's handling of medical treatment for a Western Sahara separatist leader. The Moroccan consulate has asked fans to \"show sportsmanship regardless of the result\" and to avoid doing anything that could trigger incidents with Spanish fans.\u00a0"},

Many use no-lose bets to experiment with new markets or bet types.\u00a0 Ahead of World Cup matches, punters should not be surprised to see enhanced odds on selected outcomes. For example, the price for Brazil to beat Cameroon in Group G could move from 1/4 to 1/2 ahead of kick-off. This will significantly enhance the potential returns.\u00a0 How punters take advantage of World Cup betting offers will vary between bookies. However, new customer offers will be similar across the board. The following is a step-by-step guide for punters in the UK to follow: Before signing up and taking advantage of a World Cup betting offer, there are some key factors to consider. Each promotion comes with unique terms and conditions. So, when reading the small print, look out for the following points: When betting on the World Cup, there are a huge number of markets available. These include pre-match, live and outright options, with the following being the most common: Betting on which nation will win the World Cup is always a popular market. Each country is handed odds ahead of the tournament, with prices fluctuating throughout, based on results and other factors.\u00a0 England\u2019s Harry Kane won the World Cup Golden Boot award in 2018. Betting on which player will score the most goals during the tournament is available with the majority of bookies. Top attackers will be given the shortest odds.\u00a0 At the end of the World Cup, a single player will be named as the Golden Ball winner. The likes of Luka Modric and Lionel Messi have won over recent years. The player of the tournament does not always come from the winning team, so think carefully before backing your favourite.\u00a0 For goalkeepers at the World Cup, the Golden Glove award is much coveted. Based on which keeper puts in the best performances during the tournament, Iker Casillas, Manuel Neuer, and Thibaut Courtois have received the award in the past.\u00a0 It is also possible to bet on who will be named Young Player of the Tournament following the conclusion of the World Cup. Only those aged 21 or younger can win, with odds on the likes of Jude Bellingham, Pedri, and Jamal Musiala likely to be short in 2022.\u00a0 Available both pre-match and in-play, punters can bet on the result of an individual match. There will be three options for each match, Team A win, draw, or Team B win. Only the score after normal time will be eligible. Knockout round matches will come with a greater number of markets, including winning on penalties.\u00a0 While being a risky bet, wagering on which player will open the scoring in a World Cup match is both exciting and potentially rewarding. For example, back Kylian Mbappe to score first when France play. As you would expect, top strikers will be given the shortest odds, with defenders having much higher prices. As the name suggests, you can bet \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as to whether both teams will find the back of the net during a World Cup match. Again, only goals scored in normal time will count.\u00a0 For those looking for greater odds, the correct score market is worth considering. You can bet on any potential score, whether it be 1-0, 3-2, or 5-0. Odds will vary, based on the likelihood of each scoreline occurring.\u00a0 Acca bets can be placed on World Cup matches too. This is a single bet that features at least four selections. For example, betting on the match result of all four games that take place on a single day during the group stage.\u00a0 If you have a problem with gambling, or you know someone who does, help is out there.

{"title": "The curious case of Alvaro Morata keeps Dream Team World Cup managers intrigued but wary", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "1 Dec 2022", "content": "ALVARO MORATA has long been divisive figure. His admirers rightly herald his movement, technical ability, aerial threat and football intelligence. His critics struggle to see anything other than a frustratingly wasteful finisher. As is often the case, the reality lies in the middle ground. Generally speaking, Dream Team World Cup managers have stayed clear of the Atletico Madrid striker, preferring to invest in more reliable goalscorers such as Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and the like. It's not and open-and-shut case though, because Spain are arguably the best international team in the world between in space between the penalty areas. With Pedri, Gavi, Dani Olmo and company providing plenty of creativity, the temptation to back the centre-forward on the receiving end of La Roja's approach play is strong, no matter who that individual may be. Gaffers who swerved Morata (3.1% ownership) would have felt relieved when the 30-year-old, who complained of some mild cold-like symptoms, was named on the bench against Costa Rica last week. However, there was a twist in the tale as Morata came off the bench midway through the second half to assist one goal before scoring one of his own as the Central Americans collapsed to a 7-0 defeat. Incredibly, the ex-Chelsea striker then repeated the trick against Germany as he scored eight minutes after his introduction in the second half. After two games, Morata has scored two goals and assisted another despite only being on the pitch for 69 minutes. This efficient effort has resulted in 15 points, a tally only bettered by two other forwards among those who have played just two games at the time of writing. And so, it's all eyes on Luis Enrique's starting line-up this evening when Spain take on Japan as the 2010 world champions seek to confirm their place in the last 16. Given that Morata has massed 15 points from just 69 minutes so far, the luxury of a start could be very profitable indeed. Dream Team World Cup gaffers will probably need to make some transfers once the group stage is done and dusted and Spain's No7 should be on a few shortlists at least... unless he's benched again this evening."},

The Fifa World Cup in Qatar has disrupted telly schedules on the BBC and ITV this winter, with many popular shows having to adapt to accommodate the football. But the biggest change to the Strictly schedule yet was too much for fans to take when it was announced by the official Instagram account. One viewer said: \"What fresh hell is this?!\" Another posted: \"This is ridiculous. Use one of the other BBC channels. No one wants to watch strictly on a work/school night.\" A third wrote: \"Nooooooo stop bloody changing it ffs \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I like my Saturday Strictly nights.\" Tonight's quarter-final result show was a day earlier than usual and at a different time to make way for round of 16 games. Viewers thought the right person was eliminated as Kym Marsh became the tenth celebrity to leave the ballroom. The former   was given a bye last week after   but despite being back to full health, Kym and pro partner Graziano di Prima were sent home after a dance-off with  CBBC star Molly performed a Charleston to Hot Honey Rag from the musical Chicago, while Kym performed a Cha Cha to Fame from the musical Fame. The judges voted three to one in favour of saving Molly, with Anton du Beke the sole Kym supporter. For the most part, viewers thought the decision was the correct one. One fan wrote: \"I am happy with that decision. Weakest of the night.\" Another posted: \"Right person went for me this week. Love Kym but I think she was the weakest dancer.\" A third said: \"Right result, the competition was so good tonight, unfortunately Kym was the weakest.\" Craig Revel Horwood said: \u201cIt\u2019s always so difficult at this point of the competition, because both couples danced brilliantly, I don\u2019t want to see either couple go. I am really splitting hairs, but the couple I want to save, based just on the best dance tonight for me is Molly and Carlos.\u201d Motsi Mabuse told the couples: \u201cFirst of all, I want to say to both of you, that you can be so so proud of yourselves. You\u2019ve both been so great and amazing. I\u2019m going to base my decision on this dance off and I\u2019m going to save Molly and Carlos.\u201d Anton said: \u201cAs you\u2019d expect at this time of the competition, the quality of the dance off was incredible, I thought both couples danced brilliantly, but I felt one couple raised their game with a freedom which they didn\u2019t have on Friday night, and because of that I am going to save Kym and Graziano.\u201d Head judge Shirley Ballas decided the result and said: \u201cWell first of all huge congratulations to both couples. Both couples danced exquisitely, it\u2019s been a very difficult decision to make. But based on this dance and this dance alone, I\u2019m going to save Molly and Carlos.\u201d Kym only had positives to say in her exit chat with host Tess Daly. Having overcome a series of health challenges through the series, she said: \u201cHonestly I\u2019ve loved every single second that I\u2019ve been here. I never thought I\u2019d get to this stage, in a million years.  \"I have to say, it\u2019s all down to this man [Graziano] here, he is just wonderful and he will be my friend forever. But what a journey it\u2019s been, this show is just wonderful, it shows you things about yourself you don\u2019t know, it shows you how tough you can be. Everybody, the crew, the celebs, the pros, costume, make up, everyone is amazing. I\u2019ve had the best time, so thank you.\u201d On the support from her family, Kym said \u201cMy dad has been so proud and it\u2019s kind of kept him going. When he was in hospital last week, and obviously we weren\u2019t here, all these guys sent him videos and it meant such a lot. My grandchildren are so proud.\u201d Italian stallion Graziano returned the compliments, saying: \u201cI will be part of your family forever, I think we became friends from the very first day. I know you\u2019ve learnt how to dance, but I have learnt so much from you, you are a warrior. You\u2019re going to be in my heart forever, we\u2019re going to be together many times, because I know I have found a friend for life.\u201d Tonight\u2019s results show opened with a dazzling routine from the Strictly professional dancers in an energetic number from Guys and Dolls. Plus The Cher Show performed a medley of hits. The remaining five couples will take to the dancefloor next week for the semi final when Strictly Come Dancing will air live on Sunday 10th December at 7.15pm, with the results show on Monday 11th December on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."},

Model and football fan Marta Barczok announced she would skip the controversial   in Qatar.  The infuencer had attended various tournaments in the past including Euro 2016, 2020 and World Cup 2018.  But she told The Sun Online she would not be going to Qatar due to the country's human rights record and fears of \"corruption\".  Speaking to us ahead of Poland's game today against Saudi Arabia, Marta she also predicted she thinks England will reach the top four.  And she revealed her favourite Three Lions star-  . Marta told The Sun Online: \"I think England will be in the top four, you have a really great squad and of course Harry Kane, who in my opinion is one of the best striker in the world plays. \"I watch him live during Tottenham games, I support Spurs and I am on most of the home games.\" The model predicted that France would go to the finals and shared her hopes Poland would reach the semi-finals. She said that \"looking at the first game I don't think this will be that easy\". But she warned: \"You should look out for Lewandowski and Zielinki for sure.\" The Poland supporter admitted she was hesitant not to attend the World Cup at first as \"football emotions often win over reason\". But she eventually decided she would skip the tournament and a chance to see her beloved side.  Marta explained: \"I decided not to go to Qatar where human rights are not respected, people with football have as much in common as I do with the spaceship, all that matters is money and only money.  \"Corruption surrounds us everywhere, in the economic, sports or administrative industries, but I never had any idea that it could be done on such a scale.  \"I respect all those who went despite everything, and I will support our team with them. \"I hesitated until the last moment because football emotions often win over reason, but this time, apart from these emotions, there is nothing else why I would go there. When asked about her views on rainbow flags being banned at the stadiums, Marta replied: \"Everyone has the right to freedom, the rainbow symbol is a sign of freedom, tolerance and unity, any prohibitions such as rainbow flags being banned are disrespect for human rights, community, freedom, and hope.\""},

The expat pair - who have asked not to be named fearing reprisals from  \u2019s hardline Islamic regime - said they were turned away five times for wearing the \"offensive\" fancy dress. They missed the first half of the  ' opening game against Iran after being challenged by a guard who tugged at the outfits and asked: \"Are you here to kill Muslims?\" Both fans - a 56-year-old builder and a 57-year-old engineer - have worked on   infrastructure projects and stadia in Qatar for 10 years. They eventually complied with requests to surrender their garb comprising chainmail, helmets and rubber swords. But when they attempted to enter to watch the second half wearing t-shirts and shorts they were ushered to a side room and ordered to strip. The engineer said: \"We are both huge fans of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and had our costumes handmade in India - they\u2019re brilliant and cost \u00a33,000 each. \"We thought it would be a laugh to dress up for the game in keeping with the tradition we\u2019ve seen at virtually every previous World Cup. \"But the staff at the security checkpoints first denied us entry because of our helmets, then they said the shields and rubber swords were a problem, then the tunics were offensive. \"We ended up going back and forth five or six times to various checkpoints - all the time complying with their requests. \"This went on for two-and-a-half hours and led to us missing the first half so we decided to ditch all the gear as we\u2019d paid more than \u00a3180 for our tickets. \"But as we tried to get in we were taken into a small side room by three staff and told to strip naked.\u00a0 \"There was no reason for it - they didn\u2019t even search us - and it was just ritual humiliation. Absolutely appalling treatment.\" Video circulated on social media showed four officers at a security cordon escorting the pair away before England\u2019s 6-2 triumph over Iran at Doha\u2019s Al Khalil Stadium. At one point one of them tugged at my chainmail and asked me: 'Have you come here to kill Muslims?' England fans have supported the team dressed as crusader knight St George - the nation\u2019s patron saint - at every previous World Cup. But FIFA officials warned it was unwise to don the costumes in Qatar in light of the Islamic nation\u2019s history. The best-known Crusades took place between 1095 and 1291 when Christian armies fought bloody battles to seize Jerusalem and the surrounding area from Islamic rule. Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out has also warned fancy dress \"knights or crusaders\" may not be a laughing matter at this World Cup. The builder - who has worked on some of the eight stadia built during Qatar\u2019s \u00a3185 billion World Cup spending spree - said: \"I have many Muslim friends and colleagues here and I was horrified by their conduct. \"We came in fancy dress like many England fans have in the past but these people did not see the funny side at all - they were very nasty. \"At one point one of them tugged at my chainmail and asked me: 'Have you come here to kill Muslims?' \"I told him: 'I\u2019ve come here to have fun and watch the football mate. What are you talking about?' \"We were cross about missing the first half by the time we tried to enter wearing ordinary clothes but were both shocked when they ordered a strip search. \"Three security staff in a very small room stood around us pointing and sneering. It was awful.\" The engineer said: \"I have quite a few tattoos and they spent a lot of time studying them and mocking me.\u00a0 \"We weren\u2019t given intimate searches - they just wanted to demean us and teach us a lesson. \"I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening and when I got down to my underpants I asked: 'Do you really want to see my penis?' One of them replied: 'Yes. Take them off.' The two Brits said they had not made any complaints to authorities about the incident. The builder said: \"Where is the point in this place? If I complained to the police I\u2019d lose my job and get deported immediately - that\u2019s the reality of life here. \"Everything has been scrubbed clean and whitewashed for the World Cup but everyone here lives in a climate of fear.\" The pair donned their crusader gear to cheer with England fans at Doha\u2019s Red Lion pub during yesterday\u2019s Wales v Iran game but changed into t-shirts and jeans for yesterday\u2019s game. The engineer said: \"We\u2019re taking no chances this time - we don\u2019t want to go through that again.\" FIFA said: \"We can provide some clarity on FIFA\u2019s position through our response to you, based on our discussions with the relevant units within FIFA. \"FIFA strives to create a discrimination-free environment, to promote diversity across the organisation and in all of its activities and events in accordance with the FIFA Statutes, FIFA\u2019s Human Rights Policy and several other FIFA regulations and codes. \"Crusader costumes in the Arab context can be offensive against Muslims.

This World Cup is likely to be the 52-year-old\u2019s last tournament and he will stand or fall by his most trusted lieutenants. They are the hill he is willing to die on. England haven\u2019t won for six matches \u2014 their worst run since the dog days of Graham Taylor\u2019s reign almost 30 years ago.

But England now have battle-hardened players with records of rising to the occasion, rather than shrinking, at major tournaments. Southgate\u2019s critics, who tore into him at Molineux and the San Siro after dismal Nations League defeats, seem to forget we spent decades fretting over the reasons for England\u2019s chronic failure on the biggest stages. Playing with fear, burnout after long seasons, club cliques hurting team spirit, an obsession with celebrity, a phobia of penalty shootouts,\u00a0an inability to cope with the\u00a0boredom in camps. And during the reigns of Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello, managers who lacked supreme motivation. But nobody has talked of these issues before   \u2014 because England have exceeded expectations in \u00adsuccessive tournaments. The impending dread of inevitable failure is no more. England are united, happy and unburdened by fear.

Maguire went into those Euros injured but Southgate gambled on the   skipper and fortune favoured his boldness. Even now, with Maguire struggling to get a game for United, Southgate won\u2019t jettison him. Southgate said: \u201cLoyalty comes from performances over time and knowing that to play for England is a different experience to any other, players have to handle that. \u201cHarry is technically a fantastic footballer, he\u2019s a very strong leader and we haven\u2019t got anybody else with that physical presence. \u201cAnd there are the relationships with other defenders \u2014 the more those relationships are there over a period of time, it is helpful.\u201d Everything you need to know about the World Cup  Latest news and updates from Qatar  What are the kick-off times for ALL matches?  - how much does the winner earn?

This will be Queiroz\u2019s fourth consecutive   as a manager, having been in charge of Portugal in South Africa in 2010 and Iran in both 2014 and 2018. It is the 69-year-old\u2019s second stint with   but will be his third time marching his players out onto the grandest stage in football, making him the longest reigning manager in the country\u2019s history. England are comfortably the favourites to win this Group B opener, but Queiroz\u2019s teams are notably pragmatic, dogged and determined. Claiming all three points will be massive for the Three Lions to get up and running early on, putting nerves to bed and easing some pressure off of Southgate\u2019s shoulders after some recent torrid displays from a team winless in six competitive matches. Here are three key areas where this game can be won and lost for England and Iran. When England reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, bowing out to a hyper-charged Croatia in the end, Jude Bellingham was just 15 years old. Despite being an unearthed gem rising through Birmingham City\u2019s youth academy, nobody outside of the club had heard of the teenager with talent in abundance. Fast forward four years later and Bellingham is already one of the best midfielders in Europe at the ripe age of 19 and is being linked with some of Europe\u2019s elite including Manchester United, Real Madrid and Manchester City for upwards of \u00a3100 million. If England go far in the Qatar World Cup, potentially even winning the prestigious competition, Bellingham will certainly be the key. Nonetheless, regarding Monday\u2019s opponents, Bellingham will be vital to helping Southgate\u2019s side break through Iran during attacking transitions. The teenager is unbelievably quick for a central midfield player which is one of the reasons why Bellingham was shoehorned out to the flanks upon arrival at Borussia Dortmund in 2020. On top of this, he is explosive on the ball and is able to burst through pressure from onrushing defenders, beating them with his exceptional dribbling. For the most part, Bellingham\u2019s wonderful dribbling won\u2019t be overly helpful for Southgate\u2019s England in this match due to Iran being likely to sit back and soak up pressure. However, there will be times when Iran are forced to come out and be a little more expansive with their play.  When these moments occur, Bellingham will be vital for hitting the Middle Easterners on the break. Being on the backfoot against a counterattack is one area where Iran have really struggled under Queiroz.  The manager is keen for his side to counterpress upon losing possession, bunching together to regain the ball and stopping the opposition\u2019s counter as far up the pitch as possible. Unfortunately, this has left the side exploitable at times once the initial counterpress is broken. Counterpressing is when a team hunts down the ball in packs in a structured manner as soon as possession is turned over to the hands of the opposition. Plenty of sides in the modern game counterpress. The likes of Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola revolutionised the football over the last decade by integrating fascinating methods of this into their tactics. The key factor for this to be a success is having energy in the midfield.  But with the average age of Iran\u2019s squad at this World Cup at 28.9, the oldest at the tournament, counterpressing will be more difficult due to Queiroz favouring experience over youth. This is where Bellingham can tear them to shreds, using his explosive speed and dribbling to bypass midfield pressure and beating the counterpress to leave the defensive line vulnerable. A lot has been said about the defenders Southgate chose to give a seat to on the plane to Qatar. Manchester United's Harry Maguire and Tottenham's Eric Dier were picked by the manager who opted to leave Fikayo Tomori at home in Milan, dealing a massive blow to the confidence of the AC Milan star. Even though England\u2019s results have been below par recently, with notably poor displays from Maguire and Dier, it is likely the duo will be involved as two-thirds of Southgate\u2019s back three. The former Middlesbrough manager\u2019s favoured central defensive trio has been Maguire on the left, Dier in the middle with Kyle Walker as the right centre-back. Out of possession, Southgate needs his centre-backs to be aggressive. When the ball is moved between the lines and the midfielders are already occupied, the defenders must step out and close the opposition player down to try and snuff out the danger. Playing with a back three makes it easier for central defenders to be aggressive than in a two-man partnership.  This is because when one steps up to close down an opponent there are still two covering behind that can plug the vacant space. However, if this space isn\u2019t closed by the remaining centre-backs, it can leave a lot of room for opposition forwards to run into which can be dangerous given the lack of speed from Maguire and Dier. Iran will look to exploit this throughout the match and it will likely give Team Melli the greatest opportunity to score. By nature, Queiroz\u2019s side are extremely direct, always looking to play longer passes into the channels to runners in behind. If Iran can drag Walker deeper and get in behind Maguire and Dier with players such as FC Porto\u2019s prolific star Mehdi Taremi or Omonia Nicosia\u2019s Karim Ansarifard they will cause damage to England. Iran are really well-drilled under Queiroz which is a testimony to the manager as well as his predecessor Dragan Sko\u010di\u0107 with whom the national team qualified for the World Cup. Defensively, Iran press high up the pitch, especially against opponents of a similar or lesser quality. But in games versus better opponents, Iran usually drop into a low block. This is to ensure the distance between the backline and the goalkeeper is minimal to prevent the attacking side from playing to runners in behind the defence. Uruguay suffered from this rigid gameplan back in September in a 1-0 defeat to Iran.  The potent Uruguayan frontline, including Liverpool\u2019s \u00a385 million man Darwin Nunez, posed little to no threat thanks to the excellent structure of Team Melli. Queiroz has set his players up in a 4-3-3 so far during his brief second stint. When Iran defend this drops into a 4-1-4-1 as the wingers fall back to the midfield line. That\u2019s not to say Iran are impossible to break down, far from it. The team still have flaws during games that can be exploited. One of the keys to breaking down a low block is to get the ball into space between the lines as teams can create better chances centrally than out wide. Playing through a block like this requires a high level of technical competency, something England have in abundance with players such as Mason Mount, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish and James Maddison. Iran struggle when the attacking side quickly plays the ball between the lines and the lack of energy in the team rears its ugly head as the players are unable to get to the ball fast enough to intercept passes. Southgate normally deploys two \u201810\u2019s in the England team, with two inside wingers acting as playmakers in a 3-4-2-1 in a similar vein to how Chelsea won the Champions League under Thomas Tuchel. It's unclear which combination of players Southgate will use but it\u2019s relatively certain that Mount will be involved in the starting lineup due to his ability to break open low blocks. England are clear favourites to beat Iran.  Queiroz\u2019s side could end up being the whipping boys of a tough group if Southgate\u2019s men win in emphatic fashion in the group opener. But failure to pick up an early three points would lead to intense pressure re-emerging on the shoulders of the England coach and would feel highly reminiscent of the  ."},

Azmoun also owns a \u00a361,000 thoroughbred named Oubitsa who is the son of the hugely successful mare Palentino, winner of the Australian Guineas in 2016. Azmoun knows all about the pressure of being Iran's star man, having carried the expectations of 84million people going into the 2018 World Cup. The forward had scored 23 goals in 33 caps before that tournament but did not deliver in Russia, failing to score as Iran were knocked out in the group stage. That sparked significant criticism, so much so that Azmoun revealed it was affecting his mother's health, so he decided to retire from international football. Azmoun described that decision as \"painful\" having represented his country since he was 19-years-old.

No problem.  \"I\u2019d sacrifice that for one hair on the heads of Iranian women. This story will not be deleted. They can do whatever they want. Shame on you for killing so easily; long live Iranian women.\" As well as impressing for his country, Azmoun caught the eye at Zenit St Petersburg, where he scored 52 goals in 79 league games.

Being the second largest city in the Gulf State with a population of around 200,000 people, Lusail has seen billions of pounds ploughed into it - turning it into a the \"city of the future\".  With an crescent moon skyscraper hotel, huge man-made islands, whole districts wired for climate control, and a brand new stadium - the city is a key part of the   National Vision 2030.

And the city will host its first   game on Tuesday with a clash between Argentina and Saudi Arabia.  Behind all the glitzy buildings and high-tech systems however there are fears the city - like many infrastructure projects in Qatar - harbours a dark secret.  It is feared such rapid developments have been built on the suffering of thousands of migrant workers - something Qatar denies.  Human rights groups estimate more than 6,500 workers have died in Qatar since they won the right to stage the World Cup.  Qatar has a two million strong migrant workforce - with many of them said to work for low pay in sweltering conditions. And these workers may have been responsible for creating the metropolis which will host ten games during the World Cup - including the final on December 18.  Qatar denies mistreatment of migrant workers and says it is proactively working to improve standards.  Once completed, it is hoped Lusail will have a theme park, a lagoon, two marinas, two golf courses, 22 hotels along with luxury shopping and commercial districts.

Incredible earthworks have seen four man made islands spring up the city which was essentially built from scratch.  The\u00a0Lusail Iconic Stadium has capacity for 80,000 people.  And the city hosted Qatar's first Formula 1 race last year when Lewis Hamilton won the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But one of the most recognisable parts of the city is the crescent moon hotel complex, the Katara Towers.  It is 692 ft tall with 40 floors - housing two luxury hotels along with apartments, offices and shops.  And while the city is an incredible complex, it is feared to be built of the backs of poorly paid migrant workers. Construction workers helping to build stadiums are reported to have been paid less than \u00a31 an hour. As FIFA prepares to rake in\u00a0billions in revenue\u00a0from sponsors and broadcasters, many migrant worker families still mourn the death of their loved ones And some are said to have died as they worked in the blazing heat of Qatar.  Human Rights Watch compiled a report which details how migrant workers are allegedly exploited using the \"kafala system\". Workers mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Philippines find themselves in a form of \"forced labour\". The kafala system ties workers visas to a sponsorship by their employer - who is responsible for their legal status.  Migrants can end have to pay up to \u00a32,200 just to secure a job. And this is something that can lead to them emptying their savings or selling what little assets they have, only to them find themselves trapped in low paying jobs. Kafala rules then mean the workers can't even leave - with many being reported to have \"absconded\" by their employers, which is a criminal offense in Qatar.  Human Rights Watch have said the kafala system as \"at the heart\" of all abuses of migrant workers working ahead of the World Cup.  \"[Our] research has shown that abusive legislation and policies, the time pressure, and attempts to contain the exorbitant costs, have resulted in abuses against migrant workers, including work in life-threatening conditions, low wages or illegal recruitment fees,\" the group said in   to the European Parliament. \"As FIFA prepares to rake in\u00a0billions in revenue\u00a0from sponsors and broadcasters, many migrant worker families still mourn the death of their loved ones and\u00a0struggle\u00a0to feed their children or pay off loans their loved ones took out to pay illegal World Cup recruitment fees.\" \n"},

{"title": "Cameroon have tough World Cup group with Brazil and Serbia, even if Onana saves them \u2013 predicted line-up and stats", "author": null, "date": "19 Nov 2022", "content": "CAMEROON face a strong group. Their opponents in Group G will be Serbia, Brazil, and Switzerland. Serbia seems to be the most likely team to reach the Round of 16, together with Brazil. The Africans will have to fight against the Europeans to reach the Round of 16, as   is definitely expected to finish 1st in the Group. Let's learn more about the international team of Cameroon! Since taking the job mid-calendar year,   has deployed many different formations with Cameroon. Given the side\u2019s strength in depth in the midfield department, the manager has been able to chop and change the shape depending on the opponent. Primarily,   shift between conventional back four systems, such as 4-4-2, 4-3-3, and 4-1-4-1, as well as the 4-2-3-1, although this has been the structure least used by the Cameroonians. Given that Cameroon will potentially be forced to drop off and defend for large parts of their games, Song will likely line his players out in a 4-4-2. Over the course of 2022 so far, Cameroon have boasted\u00a056%\u00a0of ball possession per game, on average.\u00a0 During the AFCON last year, the side held the third-highest possession average in the competition at 58%, losing only to Morocco and Algeria who had higher numbers. However, Cameroon\u2019s numbers are greatly inflated due to Song\u2019s team playing a lot worse opposition than what the Indomitable Lions should expect in Group G of the  .\u00a0 For instance, in Cameroon\u2019s recent friendly against South Korea, the African giants had merely\u00a038%\u00a0of the ball and lost 2-0. Song is quite relaxed about his players having possession of the ball. It would be far from correct for any pundit to call Cameroon a possession-oriented team.\u00a0 This is because on the ball, particularly during the\u00a0build-up\u00a0phase, the manager is keen to play direct football. Cameroon do like to position themselves to play out from the back, with the goalkeeper often trying to build up from the defensive field directly to the attacking zone. When the Cameroonians do so, the centre-backs split wide to accommodate the higher positioning of the goalkeeper while the fullbacks move up the pitch on the flanks. Once the ball is played long towards the frontmen, the objective for Cameroon is to win the second ball. In the image below, the left centre-back has hit the ball directly to the centre-forward who has managed to drag the entire Algeria backline into a deeper position.  Players like Choupo-Moting and   are excellent aerially and with their hold-up play, making direct passes an efficient option for Cameroon. The same principle applies when Cameroon are set up in a structured positional attack around the halfway line and are attempting to break down an opponent\u2019s defensive\u00a0zone. Again, here, we see both Cameroon\u2019s central midfielder and centre-forward making a run in behind the Burundi backline. In attack, there is nothing overly innovative or astonishing about Cameroon.  However, they do have proven, European quality among their ranks in attacking positions across the forward line and the advanced midfielders. One of the key elements of Cameroon\u2019s play is that it is very direct and very physical. Cameroon are one of the highest pressing sides in Africa, certainly out of the teams from the continent that have qualified for the upcoming Qatar World Cup. Out of possession, Song is a highly progressive coach. The gaffer wants his side to press high up the pitch, stifling the opponent\u2019s build-up play and attempting to win the ball in very dangerous areas where they can transition from defence to attack in an instant and try to create opportunities. Each player is tasked with tightly marking one of the nearest passing options for the opposition. Here, the players have all been assigned a man to mark when Burundi are attempting to pass out from deep.\u00a0 When pressing in a high block, Cameroon are actually really effective and cause a lot of trouble for their opponents which can be seen from the following data visual. Since AFCON in 2021, Toko Ekambi, who has been used as a winger as well as a centre-forward. However, Song has a tendency to only order his players to press against lesser opponents as these are games where Cameroon have the best opportunity to win their individual duels against each man. In matches against teams of greater quality, such as Algeria or Morocco, Cameroon have primarily dropped off to defend in a compact defensive block, limiting the space behind the backline. As can be seen from this image, Cameroon\u2019s 4-1-4-1 defensive block is narrow between the lines. If an opponent plays the ball inside the lines, the players must gang up to either win back possession or force a pass back outside before recouping the same shape. Here, the Algerian midfielder has received and turned on the ball. In an attempt to negate the ball carrier carrying the ball further, the two nearest players quickly close him down. Transitions are not overly important to the overall tactical set-up of Cameroon.\u00a0 Defensively, there is more of a game plan or at least an idea of how to act in this phase. Unlike most teams these days, Cameroon don\u2019t counterpress. Counterpressing is a collective effort from numerous nearby players in a structured manager to close down the ball carrier, cutting off a counterattack at its source. Song\u2019s men are merely looking to delay their opponent\u2019s breakaway.\u00a0 This can be through fouling or by genuinely making an excellent tackle. In this example against Burundi, the Cameroon player tracking back shuttled the carrier out wide, closing off the possibility of the attacker playing back inside.\u00a0 When attacking, the manager allows his players to be freer with their movement, emphasising plenty of ball-carrying, dribbling past opponents and running in behind. Having players such as Zambo-Anguissa who is an excellent ball carrier as well as Jean Onana while Aboubakar and Toko Ekambi move beyond the opponent\u2019s backline is instrumental to Cameroon being dangerous during attacking transitions. Nouhou Tolo on the left and Collins Fai on the right will be important in providing width for Cameroon. Jean-Charles Castelletto and Nicolas Nkoulou, this will be the duo in the middle of the back four, could form a decent partnership for the African nation.\u00a0 Furthermore, Andr\u00e9 Onana will be vital at initiating Cameroon\u2019s attacks. Samuel Gouet has been Song\u2019s preferred option as the \u20186\u2019 for Cameroon over the past calendar year. The midfielder will be instructed to make passes into the space between the lines to the forward line and advanced midfielders while also protecting the backline during transitions. It is further forward in the middle where Cameroon possess the most quality. Jean Onana and Zambo-Anguissa are two incredibly exciting midfielders.\u00a0 In attack, Cameroon are stacked with experience, power, pace, strength, intelligence and goalscoring ability with players such as Vincent Aboubakar, Choupo-Moting and Toko Ekambi who have played at the highest level in Europe. However, the depth from the bench will be equally important. Bryan Mbeumo and Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou are interesting options too. Cameroon have several excellent players within the squad, especially those who are applying their trade at some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs including Andr\u00e9 Onana at Internazionale and  , and so it was extremely difficult to pinpoint which player would be absolutely key for the Rigoberto Song in Qatar. However, Franck Zambo-Anguissa is definitely a strong name of this team. Having failed to adapt to life in the   with Fulham, the midfield general moved on loan to Villarreal and later Napoli before permanently joining the latter last summer. Now, he is a star performer for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s Serie A table-toppers. Cameroon faces a strong group alongside Brazil, Serbia and Switzerland and are certainly the underdogs from the quartet. Realistically, Cameroon should finish bottom of the foursome but a win and a draw against Serbia and Switzerland could be enough to see Song\u2019s side advance. As they\u2019ll face Switzerland, the third force of this group, in the first game, a victory could be very important to boost morale and perhaps allow them a chance to finish 2  behind Brazil and reach the Round of 16."},
{"title": "Morocco have Ziyech and Hakimi to cause opposition problems at World Cup in Qatar \u2013 predicted line up and stats", "author": null, "date": "19 Nov 2022", "content": "IN the upcoming World Cup, Morocco have been placed in group F with Belgium, Croatia and Canada.  are ranked 22nd in the world, while   are 2nd and Croatia are 12th, making Morocco third-favourite to get out of the group.  Canada sit in 41st, and have been mentioned as dark horses for the tournament - a little optimistically. Since the appointment of the new manager, we only have two friendlies to go from for the predicted starting XI. In the past two games, Morocco have lined up in a 4-1-4-1 formation, with a style based on creating chances through combination plays and attempts to keep possession of the ball in a patient system. In goal, Yassine Bounou is one of the first names on the team sheet. The 31-year-old has been a regular for Sevilla and his strong shot-stopping abilities have the potential to help Morocco advance through a few extra rounds. Arguably Morocco\u2019s strongest area is their back line.   is one of the best full-backs in the world, with his immense speed, ability to attack the box and ability to cross the ball into dangerous areas. Hakimi is an important element of the team, and his combinations with   will likely be a key difference between failure and success in Qatar. At left-back, Noussair Mazraoui from   will provide an excellent technical base from which Morocco can build play. Originally a right back, Mazraoui has the technical ability and ability to play with either foot which allows him to be comfortable on the left-hand side. He is vital to how Morocco how have been trying to progress the ball through the thirds, as well as providing a threat in the opposition box as well. At centre-back, we can expect a pairing of Romain Saiss and Nayef Aguerd.  Romain Saiss has been playing all season, but he recently picked up an injury, which makes it unclear if he will be available for selection or not. His aerial presence would be missed if he were to be unavailable, but Morocco do have a young defender in Achraf Dari available for selection who was trusted by the coach in the September friendlies. In midfield, Sofyan Amrabat sits at the base, with an important role in the build-up phase.  Amrabat has been key as he drops deeper to collect the ball from the defence and helps progress it up the pitch. Amrabat\u2019s ability to stay patient, and always offer a passing option are key ways in how Morocco will attempt to keep possession of the ball when they win it. Ahead of the pivot, Azzedine Ounahi and Amine Harit are the No8\u2019s for Morocco. Ounahi was pivotal in the qualification phase for the World Cup. Both he and Harit are creative midfielders, with excellent dribbling qualities that make the pair tricky to press, and difficult to tackle in the final third. In the front line, Hakim Ziyech makes his return to the squad after coming out of international retirement.  Ziyech has seen his game time become limited in the past few seasons, after becoming merely a rotation option for  .\u00a0 On the left wing, Sofiane Boufal is expected to retain his place in the starting XI. Youssef En-Nesyri leads the attack for Morocco.  The Sevilla striker has struggled for first-team minutes this season but has scored 14 goals for Morocco in 48 appearances. The target man will thrive off crosses coming into the box from the likes of Ziyech, or perhaps cutbacks from Hakimi.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Morocco rank very highly amongst nations in the   in their attacking metrics \u2014 though it must be noted that the standard of competition they\u2019ve faced over the last calendar year differs from the quality they\u2019ll come up against in Qatar.\u00a0 When Morocco gain possession of the ball, they look to build play out from the back rather than going long. The image below shows a great example of how Mazraoui can evade pressure by passing the ball around to get out of a tight situation.\u00a0 When Morocco face a mid-block, Hakim Ziyech usually drifts into central midfield, from where he can make the most of his brilliant passing range and ball manipulation.\u00a0 The image below shows Ziyech in that central space, where he turns on the ball, looks up and plays a diagonal ball to the left-hand side for Mazraoui.\u00a0 In the final third, Morocco try to set up in a 2-3-5 formation and make use of wide triangle combinations with the wide central midfielder, wide player and player operating in the half space.\u00a0 In this attack pictured below, Ziyech has drifted into the wide space, which has caused the Chilean left-back to follow him, thus leaving a huge gap between the left-back and left-sided centre-back.\u00a0 Morocco have shown several different ways in which they can sustain possession and create threatening situations in the final third. It will be no surprise to see Morocco have large spells of possession at the World Cup. Morocco have a very strong backline, which will give confidence to the rest of the squad.\u00a0 From dead balls, such as goal kicks and throw-ins, Morocco look to press their opponents aggressively.\u00a0 The problem with this system, and arguably the biggest one, is the massive gap between the midfield and backline. The Morocco defenders are worried about the space behind the defence so naturally drop off while the midfield holds their position to prevent the opponents from getting possession closer to goal. As a result, opposition players can drift in the spaces between the lines, and the lack of pressure from behind means that they can easily turn with the ball and drive towards goal. What ends up happening is that Morocco\u2019s midfield is nearly non-existent, and opponents can easily give the ball to the front line and leave the defence unprotected. Morocco\u2019s lack of structure off the ball is largely worrying and will be the biggest reason for any potential failures and losses.\u00a0 In offensive transitions, Morocco are very difficult to defend against due to the number of skilful ball carriers they have running in the open space.\u00a0 The image below shows an example of Boufal excellent dribbling skill.\u00a0 When Morocco lose possession of the ball, they are inconsistent with their actions off the ball. While the depth in defence isn\u2019t the largest, there are plenty of possible players who may look to work their way into a starting spot if their performances improve in the last few weeks before the World Cup. Jawad El Yamiq has recently regained his spot in the starting line-up for Real Valladolid, who have gone on a slight winning streak in La Liga. The central defender provides adequate cover should some of the starters not recover from their injuries in time.\u00a0 Adel Taarabt was used in deeper areas in the most recent parts of his career. But, he missed out on selection in Qatar. Imran Louza is another player who can slot into the midfield role. However, there are doubts about the fact he has been injured for the entirety of the season and is only coming back to training now.\u00a0 Ilias Chair and Selim Amallah both can feature in the attacking midfield roles, as both have the vision to produce defence-cutting passes and the technical ability to dribble in tight spaces. Morocco have the adequate depth to make changes if necessary, or to add extra creativity when chasing games. Munir El Haddadi has struggled for minutes at his current club Getafe, and while he has shown promising signs in the earlier stage of his career, he has struggled to get consistency in his performance and not been up to the required level. He can provide a threat off the bench after playing for Morocco 11 times in the last 18 months with 2 goals for the nation.\u00a0 Abde Ezzalzouli is a promising young player who is currently on loan from Barcelona. He was given his debut in September, and after a few good performances whilst out on loan, he may be given a chance to try to spark a change after coming off the bench.  hasn\u2019t featured for a long time for Chelsea and is a player that seems to be slightly forgotten about.  His inconsistent performances for his club have shown that he may not be at the world-class level. However, Ziyech is capable of producing magic moments and when in form, he can carry his country to big results.\u00a0 The Moroccan magician doesn\u2019t have the greatest pass accuracy, due to his ambitious passing in the final third. While the accuracy isn\u2019t high, these passes are difficult to pull off, usually against a settled defence which gives huge rewards should it be successful. Morocco faces a hard group, and it seems like they are set to fight for the 2nd place of the Group, but we\u2019ll most likely see Belgium and Croatia qualifying to the Round of 16. If they manage to reach the eight-finals, things won\u2019t be any easier as they\u2019ll likely face Spain or  . Life won\u2019t be easy for Morocco in Qatar!"},

The cockle-warming nostalgia as we recall the agony and the ecstasy of summers long gone.  And the pre-  adrenaline rush that only comes around once every four years. But according to the polls, there are plenty of people who are just not feeling the fever for a winter World Cup in  . And maybe those polls genuinely reflect public concern about Qatar\u2019s deficiency in human rights and widespread revulsion about the bent functionaries at  who awarded Qatar the World Cup in December 2010. Qatar is a country where the authorities are accustomed to having things done exactly their way.

And then there is distaste surrounding England\u2019s opening game against  , a country busy   after Iranian police beat a woman to death for having her hijab on the wrong way (although there is no reason to believe the Iranian players support their brutal Government rather than the protesters). Yes, I know plenty of football fans who plan to sit out this World Cup. But not me. I am already reeling with excitement. But then I am a hopeless case, a  junkie from way back, a hardcore World Cup addict, because the first World Cup I can remember is 1966.  I even went to one of the games with my dad, and it remains the most vivid memory of my childhood.  The only time I ever said \u201cf***\u201d in front of my mum in my life was when Germany equalised at the end of normal time in 1966. Get the World Cup bug in a good year for England \u2014 1966, 1990 or 2018 \u2014 and you will have it for ever. And I suggest there\u2019s a good chance that all the negativity will evaporate over the course of a   hat-trick or a mazy  dribble or a spectacular  free kick or a triumphant penalty shootout. If England get to line up against Germany or Argentina or Brazil \u2014 and I predict that they will \u2014 then it will be impossible for any football fan to be indifferent about the Qatari World Cup. When migrant workers have died to build the stadia that millionaire footballers will grace, it would be crass to say let\u2019s just enjoy the football. But all World Cups tend to transcend the flaws and failings of the host nation.  When   was dancing on a table in Moscow in 2018, Emmanuel probably wasn\u2019t thinking too much about Russia\u2019s annexation of  in 2014, or the fact that, in 2012, Moscow courts passed a 100-year ban on gay pride marches. Just four years after hosting Putin\u2019s World Cup, Russia\u2019s rabble army launched a murderous ground war in Europe and pushed mankind closer to  than we have been since the  Does anyone seriously suggest that Qatar in 2022 is more morally reprehensible than Russia in 2018? The protests about Qatar \u2014 eight national captains, including Harry Kane,   in solidarity with the LGBT community \u2014 are well-intentioned but in danger of being nothing more than empty, hollow gestures. France\u2019s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has politely suggested we should simply respect the very different culture of Qatar. \u201cWhen we are in France, when we welcome foreigners, we often want them to follow our rules, to respect our culture, and I will do the same when I go to Qatar,\u201d Lloris says.  \u201cI can agree or disagree with their ideas, but I have to show respect.\u201d Do we kid ourselves we are perfect? When Bobby Moore lifted the World Cup in 1966, this country was still a full year away from the Sexual Offences Act of 1967, which legalised homosexual acts in England and Wales as long as they were consensual, in private, and between partners over 21. It is over 60 years since I was taken to the football for the first time, and I have still never seen two men holding hands at an English ground. So let\u2019s dial down the virtue signalling just a touch.  Let\u2019s not spend the next month polishing our halos. Because we are all in need of a break from the unremitting misery of these hard times. And the time to blank Qatar was 2010. THE cowardly West will fight Russia down to the last Ukrainian.  We want  defeated, but fear provoking the twitching madman into reaching for his nukes.  But this week a , killing two men. Ukraine claims it was a Russian missile.

BORIS BECKER will be quietly deported back to Germany before Christmas after spending seven months in a British jail for concealing \u00a32.5million worth of assets after declaring bankruptcy.

This week, our late Queen\u2019s former lady-in-waiting, Anne Glenconner, 90, appeared on BBC\u2019s The One Show to promote her book Whatever Next?: Lessons From An Unexpected Life.  She pointed out that \u2013 despite what the  show had suggested \u2013 she never actually made a racy remark to Princess Margaret about a young man\u2019s pert bottom. But there is something The Crown almost certainly got right. The best bit in the fifth series was when   (Elizabeth Debicki) sees heart surgeon Dr Hasnat Khan (Humayun Saeed) for the very first time.  It is an astonishing piece of television, gloriously free of writer Peter Morgan\u2019s seething republican fantasies. Debicki\u2019s Diana just stares at the overweight, Wotsits-eating doctor as if she is a woman contemplating the unlikely love of her life for the first time. Debicki\u2019s princess says nothing. Her eyes do all the talking. And they speak volumes, they write sonnets of love \u2013 and you believe every melting moment. BROOKLYN BECKHAM recently said that he isn\u2019t a famous footballer like his dad David because he is a Pisces. \u201cIt got to the point where I was just, like, I really want to make my own name for myself and work my arse off,\u201d says Brooklyn, who played at a high level until his mid-teens. \u201cI\u2019m a Pisces.

{"title": "I\u2019m sure Bukayo Saka will step up if England have another penalty shootout, the Euro 2020 final won\u2019t bother him at all", "author": null, "date": "20 Nov 2022", "content": "I WONDER if the England fans realise what a truly\u00a0great player we have in Bukayo Saka. Yes, I know I\u2019ll be accused of bias because  plays for Arsenal but, honestly, he has special gifts. What amazes me about him is he always makes the right decision, it\u2019s incredible. It is so rare for a young player - he\u2019s only just turned 21 - to instinctively know what is right in any given situation. I stress with my  Under-18 players to study him. If the situation calls for a five-yard pass he\u2019ll do it but if he has to beat someone he\u2019ll do that too. Bukayo always gets it right, which is a skill itself. His level of understanding is that he\u2019ll know if he plays a certain pass, the free player will be there. He won\u2019t try and force it. He can make the difference too with his scoring and assists. He is   - not one of those big-time types - who will come over and watch my U-18s and talk to them. In the training ground restaurant, he\u2019ll be over to chat and shake everyone\u2019s hand. Bukayo was in the academy when I was in the first team. I watched him impress in a few Youth Cup games but you never know how someone will react once they\u2019re on the big stage. But when Unai Emery came in as manager he put a bit of trust in him, playing him in a few Europa League games and, again, he made all the right decisions. In the Euros last year,   trusted him too. He missed that crucial penalty in the final but bounced back and now he\u2019s Arsenal\u2019s penalty taker. I\u2019m sure if there\u2019s another penalty shootout he will step up.  We should have no trouble against Iran, who I suspect will sit in and frustrate us but we have the players in Bukayo, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish who can unlock the door. What worries me is if   gets injured, what do we do? I played with Callum Wilson at Bournemouth and he\u2019s fantastic at what he does. He makes bad balls look good and will run in the channels but to ask him to start would be a big challenge. I was disappointed Tammy Abraham was left out because if Harry gets injured Tammy would have been a good alternative to start. It\u2019s such a big role to fill. Part of me likes a winter  . They should all be feeling good because it\u2019s not\u00a0the end of a long, gruelling season. At Arsenal we used to call it \u2018six-week syndrome\u2019 where, six weeks before the end of the season, you could feel it in your body that the season was coming to an end. There isn\u2019t that this time. We\u2019ve got a group who have been with   for a while and they know his playing style, so I don\u2019t feel only having a week\u2019s preparation will be a problem.  we should dominate the ball and can use players who there have been doubts about, like Trent Alexander-Arnold. He won\u2019t be seriously tested defensively and we can use his vision and ability to help break them down. And if he gets some confidence from that match, he can go on and have a good tournament. Foden, who I\u2019d like to see play centrally, and Grealish can create an overload or dribble past someone. We don\u2019t need two holders so I\u2019d play with what I call two No\u200a8s. If you have   sitting I\u2019d play Jude Bellingham higher up with Foden, someone who can take the ball and beat players. Bellingham is playing so well he has to start but Grealish can come on and be an impact player when they are tiring. What I don\u2019t like about the squad is there\u2019s no left-footed centre-back. You need balance. I\u2019d also prefer  because of his ability with his feet. Jordan Pickford\u2019s good at going longer but Ramsdale can play through the lines and eliminate players. The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned in  is that everyone has to be clear and everyone has to be committed. \u201cAre you clear with the playing style? Are you clear with what we\u2019re going to do when we are out of possession? Do you see the reasons why we are doing this?\u201d If they get those two aspects right, then we have enough talent to go a long way. Paddy Power's bet builder tips for England vs Iran There's not much point backing England in the straight-win market, so for a little extra value take them at -1 on the handicaps. They've been rubbish of late, but surely they can bag a few against Iran. England's forwards will be licking their lips at the chance to pile in on a limited Iran side, and even if the starting XI can't get the tally up to the magical seven, there's plenty of firepower on the bench. Harry Kane has 51 England goals to his name and could draw level or even go ahead of Wayne Rooney's 53-goal record in this game. With this selection he doesn't even need to hit the back of the net, a shot on target in both the first and second 45 will be enough. Who can forget that free-kick goal against Croatia four years ago? The Newcastle man could repeat the trick here if England win a foul high up the pitch. He might not be on fire at Chelsea yet, but Sterling was England's star at the Euros last summer and could repeat the trick in Qatar."},

Fifa has been slammed for a sudden stadium beer ban, chaotic organisation plus mounting fury over Qatar\u2019s human rights record.

Today I feel Qatari, I feel Arab, I feel  , I feel gay, I feel  , I feel a migrant worker.\u201d Swiss-Italian Infantino - who has now moved to live in Qatar - then accused the West of \u201chypocrisy\u201d over human rights.

For what we have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before giving moral lessons.\u201d The bald bigwig bizarrely cited his own discrimination experiences after being bullied as a boy for having red hair and freckles. He also defended Fifa\u2019s decision in 2010 to let Qatar host the World Cup. He said: \u201cThis one-sided moral lesson is just hypocrisy. I wonder why no one recognises the progress made here since 2016. \u201cIt is not easy to take the critics of a decision that was made 12 years ago.

{"title": "Qatar ready for World Cup curtain-raiser, but you wouldn\u2019t normally bother opening them for this underwhelming kick-off", "author": "Dave Kidd", "date": "19 Nov 2022", "content": "AFTER a dozen years of raging controversy over corruption, tragedies and hideous human-rights abuses, we finally get to the actual football. This may be a   in a nation which is too small, played at the wrong time of year and in a culture alien to most of us.

Hosts Qatar have never qualified for the finals, while their opponents have been up to their necks in bother over the eligibility of full-back Byron Castillo \u2014 an affair which almost saw them kicked out. And after this tournament, won by the Qataris under false pretences, was moved from summer to winter, this fixture was switched from Monday to Sunday in a World Cup that they are making up as they go along. At least the latest U-turn, the 11th-hour banning of alcohol inside stadiums \u2014 for rank-and-file supporters but not the corporate freeloaders, of course \u2014 could be seen as a minor triumph for human rights. Any beer lover will tell you that the inability to pay 12 quid for a Budweiser is a blessing rather than a curse. To be in Doha in the build-up to this tournament is a deeply strange experience. This is a hastily-constructed, ultra-modern metropolis built around what was a small, traditional Arab city \u2014 at the cost of the lives of thousands of mistreated migrant workers \u2014 the skyscrapers as well as the tournament\u2019s eight stadia, all within 30 miles of one another. But despite the cultural differences and the moral outrages, you can still discover pockets of World Cup fever. In central Doha, you will see thousands of locals walking around in replica Argentina shirts with  \u2019s name and No\u200a10 on their backs. As soon as their own team are dumped out \u2014 and Qatar are highly likely to follow South Africa as the only previous World Cup host nation to exit at the group stage \u2014 they will throw their weight behind Messi and Co. The little maestro\u2019s move to Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain made sure of that. Downtown Doha is now starting to resemble the united-nations melting pot of previous World Cups \u2014 the Latin Americans, in particular, travelling in vast numbers as they always do. Scores of global TV companies have set up their studios in front of the Souq Waqif \u2014 the historic marketplace which gives their coverage a rare backdrop of authentic Arab culture in this marble-and-concrete jungle. Close by, dozens of soporific camels doze around. And at a neighbouring booth, tourists are invited to \u2018Try On Qatari Dress \u2014 It\u2019s Amazing!\u2019 But football fans must strive to find an oasis of western hedonism in this desert. On the 14th floor of a central hotel, there is an Irish bar serving Guinness at \u00a315 a pint to supporters with deep pockets and raging thirsts from every corner of the globe. Qatar won the right to stage this World Cup, way back in 2010, thanks to Fifa corruption \u2014 with their crooked former boss Sepp Blatter recently admitting this had been a mistake due to the host nation\u2019s inadequate size. As culture wars raged over migrant-worker deaths and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar \u2014 as well as those beer prices \u2014 many who would normally follow England at major tournaments chose to stay well away. And that was before an appalling Qatari World Cup ambassador recently described homosexuality as a \u2018damage of the mind\u2019. These issues have completely overshadowed Qatar\u2019s own footballing prospects. Their Spanish manager Felix Sanchez presides over a squad consisting entirely of players who compete in Qatar\u2019s domestic league \u2014 and who have been frequently withdrawn from club matches to go on lengthy remote training camps. Sanchez said: \u201cWe consider ourselves very competitive and worthy of being here, even if the favourites, on paper, should be Ecuador. \u201cWe are a small country and have to work with what we\u2019ve got. The players have spent long periods of time, making a massive sacrifice, being away from their families, outside of the country, to make sure we are as competitive as possible.\u201d Given the brown-envelope culture which earned Qatar this World Cup, it was little surprise that Sanchez was asked about internet conspiracies suggesting Ecuador\u2019s players had been offered bribes to throw Sunday\u2019s opening match. He replied: \u201cThere is a lot of dangerous misinform\u00adation on the internet but we have prepared for many years to prove we are strong and competitive. \u201cNobody will destabilise us, we are not affected by it and we are excited and motivated for this historic day.\u201d"},

Alcohol is not illegal in Qatar, but being drunk in public is a crime - and there is a zero tolerance policy in place for drinking on the streets. England fans reacted with fury to the U-turn, with some vowing to still \"get p***ed\" before games. Now supporters have jokingly been brainstorming ideas about how to secretly carry booze into stadiums. One fan suggested bringing in a can of beer covered with a Coca-Cola sleeve - allowing spectators to deceive security checking for booze. Others suggested bringing in a hydration pack containing alcohol - to allow fans to drink right under the noses of stewards. Another fan even proposed filling up a watermelon with spirits.

The Manchester United striker, 21, is accused of making \"threatening and derogatory\" comments towards the alleged victim. He also allegedly accessed and monitored her social media accounts. Greenwood was pictured arriving at Minshull Street Crown Court today for his first appearance since he was granted bail last month. The footballer was originally remanded in custody after being charged by police on October 15. But a judge released him on the condition he does not contact witnesses, including the complainant, and resides at an address in Bowdon. The striker spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address and entered no pleas during the brief hearing. He was re-bailed to next appear on February 10 with a provisional trial date set for November 27, 2023. Greenwood's court appearance comes as his Three Lions teammates prepare to take on Iran in their first World Cup game in Qatar. The alleged offences relate to one woman and are said to have taken place between November 1, 2018, and October 15, 2022. Greenwood is accused of \"repeatedly engaging\" in controlling and coercive behaviour for almost four years - including making threats and derogatory comments on social media. He is also charged with attempting to rape the woman on October 21, 2021, and allegedly assaulted her between December 12, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Attempted rape carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. Police swooped on the footballer's \u00a315,000-a-month rented home in Trafford last month. He was held on suspicion of being in contact with his alleged victim in a breach of his bail conditions. The Crown Prosecution then authorised Greater Manchester Police to charge the footballer. The striker has been waiting to discover his fate since he was first held in January this year. He spent three nights in custody after he was arrested at his luxury rented home. Greenwood was bailed on February 2 and has been keeping a relatively low profile since. He was originally due to answer his bail on April 30 but the decision was pushed back after a court hearing in June. At the time, the striker was suspended by United but still received his \u00a375,000-a-week salary. The club released a statement after Greenwood's charge was announced. A spokesperson said: \"Manchester United notes that criminal charges have been brought against Mason Greenwood by the Crown Prosecution Service. \"He remains suspended by the club, pending the outcome of the judicial process.\u201d Greenwood was removed from FIFA 22 and dropped by sponsors Nike in the wake of the allegations. Football Manager 2022 has also\u00a0confirmed he will not feature\u00a0in the game. All merchandise bearing the No11's name has been axed from the official Utd site and teammates have unfollowed him on Instagram. Greenwood\u2019s promising domestic and international career remains in jeopardy. He last played for the Red Devils on January 22 when the team beat West Ham 1-0. The player joined the team aged just six and rose through the ranks to land himself a regular spot on the first team. In 2019, he became the youngest footballer to play for United in the Champions League when he took to the pitch aged 17. Greenwood has made 129 appearances in total for the Red Devils and netted 35 goals. In 2020, England manager Gareth Southgate gave the striker his first cap when Greenwood came off the bench in a 1-0 win against Iceland."},

While fans in the UK have  World Cup begins with a bang We have had fireworks wish us well, Morgan Freeman remind us that Shawshank Redemption money doesn't last forever and a first half performance that left Qatari fans heading for the door. There has been 60 foot puppets walking around and you look to your left and see an extremely heavily armed police presence go passed on camels. This has been a weird and wonderful day but it is what the World Cup is all about. Team underwhelms, money talks Qatar have left most of the football fans questioning whether the World Cup should be given to countries who will struggle to compete in the tournament. In this instance, everything bar their football left fans saying 'wow' but sadly so did their football team. Felix Sanchez looked like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, or he could be just thinking about those alleged human rights abuses by the country and wondering where that leaves him after such a defeat. Seagull maturing into cultured midfielder Moises Caicedo is one of the stars of this Ecuador side but Gustavo Alfaro tries to gel his side as a collective team rather than individuals. As a result, and was seen today, it is rare for individual players to stand out. Caicedo as can be seen from his pass map was integral to the South American's link up play. The tale of the tape Group A makes for good reading if you are an Ecuador fan. With only one game having been played, they sit proudly at the top of the table. Gustavo Alfaro will be happy if that is still the case this time next week. Ecuador looking to go Dutch The group leaders next play on Friday as they take on group-favourites the Netherlands. It will offer a completely different challenge for Gustavo Alfaro and his team but having already amassed three points it could prove to be a 'must not lose' game now. The Dutch side will play their first group game tomorrow as they face African champions Senegal. AFCON champions next for hosts Qatar will play against Senegal in their next group game on Friday. Senegal suffered a huge loss after Bayern Munich's Sadio Mane had to undergo surgery on an injury he received just before the tournament. Despite this loss, Senegal have shown their depth as they went on to claim the AFCON title, beating Mohamed Salah's Egypt in the final. Qatar will need to rethink their attacking play if they are to cause the African champions problems. Enner puts in yards for side Ecuador hero Enner Valencia put in a real shift for his side today up until the jarring of his knee. Even so, in the second half the striker still battled on until the manager saw fit to rest one of his prized-assets with the game won. Huge challenge ahead for hosts Having lost their opening group game, that leaves fixtures in the group remaining against Senegal and the Netherlands. Despite Senegal losing their talisman, Sadio Mane, the AFCON champions will still offer a huge challenge to Qatar. Netherlands, favourites to win the group, will offer no safe haven for the Qatari defence. Records broken on day one Enner Valencia may have not set the world alight at West Ham and Everton but the striker showed his true worth to his country today. His two goals got them the three points they craved but also made him Ecuador's all-time FIFA World Cup top scorer. This is only his second world cup and fourth game in the finals but he has now taken his tally to five goals. Forget results, enjoy the moment Despite the gulf in quality between the two sides today, it was great to see how much the Qatar fans continued to enjoy the showpiece event. While some left and didn't come back at half-time, those who did stay made themselves heard. Locals were immersing themselves in all the fever-pitch atmosphere that a World Cup can bring to your country. Fan zones enjoying opener Qatar fans had big hopes of their team in this World Cup as they have spend ten years working towards this opening game. They saw Ecuador as the weakest of the opponents in their group but did not expect it go as badly as did in the first half. Once the reality of the task at hand set in, the enormity of the challenge hit home. Yellow, as far as the eye can see Mainly due to all the Ecuador fans in the crowd supporting their team but Daniele Orsato contributed to proceedings also. The match referee produced more cards than Dynamo as he booked four Qatar players and two Ecuador players in a game that really wasn't that dirty. Qatar may have deserved some of theirs as they lunge into tackles that haven't been seen since the school playground but Dynamo did seem a bit card happy. It will be interesting to see if the other officials follow suit in the tournament. Tite's tip make perfect start The team that Brazil manager Tite labelled as his 'dark horses' for the World Cup tournament, showed their potential here today. Facing one of the weaker sides in the competition, Senegal and the Netherlands will prove much tougher opposition for Alfaro's side. Three points in the bag, top of the group, it was a good day at the office for Ecuador. FT: Qatar 0-2 Ecuador The hosts suffer defeat in their first World Cup finals appearance. As the stats show, they struggled to contain their opponents. FT: Qatar 0-2 Ecuador The referee brings the first game of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to an end. Ecuador had too much quality for their opponents today. A solid victory for Gustavo Alfaro's side. Inside the ground - would someone switch off the lights? If you hang on a few minutes, I can give you the names of all the fans left inside, writes  . Well, maybe not quite.\u00a0 But you get the drift. The statistics might suggest this one was tight and close. It really wasn\u2019t. Anyway, one match down, 63 to go. Hopefullymany of them better than this. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador 90+4. Qatar burst forward with the right back beating two players. As soon as it opens up for him to find a team mate, the loose pass goes straight out of play for a throw in. Pretty much sums up the day for the World Cup 2022 hosts. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador 90+2. Ecuador are knocking the ball around to ole's from their fans. Every time a yellow shirt touches the ball. The South Americans are in party atmosphere after this win. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador 90. We are going to have five additional minutes here. Late double change for Ecuador also. Estrada and Caicedo come off. Franco and Rodr\u00edguez comes on for a World Cup appearance. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador 88. The Qatar fans despite the result still seem to be enjoying their day. Ecuador have not given up on a third goal before the end. Corner to the South Americans. Inside the ground - traffic's a doddle Given the problems I had getting here, it\u2019s good news that even more of the home fans have hit the high road back to Doha with 20 minutes or more to go, writes  Qatar aren\u2019t going to score many goals, that\u2019s for sure. But I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if they end up with the most yellow cards per game of any side here. Four already and more, perhaps, to come. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador - Muntari chance 86. The home fans were awoken from their slumber then. Direct ball over the top, Muntari lets it drop and looks to lift it over the keeper who is slightly off his line. The striker just puts too much on it as it lands on the roof of the net. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador 84. This was always going to be a monumental task for Qatar. The football romantic loves to dream of an upset from the minnows but Ecuador have just had too much for them. Enner Valencia was the difference today. Without him, Ecuador could have struggled to make their domination count. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador 82. For a split second I thought Erik ten Hag was coaching Qatar. Felix Sanchez just bared an uncanny resemblance for a moment. Looking bewildered on the touchline, wondering what he is seeing from his team. Qatar 0-2 Ecuador  80. Ecuador attack looking to open up the tired legs of Qatar. The ball drops to Sarmiento inside the box who cannot keep his shot down and blazes it over the bar. He is relieved to see the offside flag up after that miss."},

They have a lot of self-respect and want to show the same respect to the people there but at the same time enjoy themselves. \"What we are going to see at this World Cup is a new style of WAG.

The controversial host nation, who have never qualified for a  , were embarrassed on their big night out in a one-sided opener which should have ended with a harsher scoreline. Instead of a lavish opening ceremony before kick-off, they might as well have just played the theme to the Muppet Show instead. This was a truly painful watch - the Qataris passing was hopeless, their defending negligent, their tackling recklessly inept and their goalkeeper shambolic. The match was played out in long stretches of silence, with thousands of locals seemingly leaving the Al Bayt Stadium in disgust at half-time. There is little footballing culture in this tiny nation, with most locals preferring camel racing and falconry, and this curtain-raiser proved yet again that the brown-envelope brigade who awarded hosting rights to Qatar have done the game a major disservice.  became the first host nation ever to lose their opening match at a World Cup and there is precious little chance of them avoiding a similar fate against Holland and Senegal. Of course, it was not the fault of Qatar\u2019s players that they had been awarded a ticket to the greatest sporting show on Earth - but, despite years of painstaking preparation, they looked like a bunch of raffle winners. The opening ceremony - which included Morgan Freeman, camels, lightsabers, topless drummers and  \u2019s World Cup Willie among a host of previous World Cup mascots - wasn\u2019t great, but it ended up being the highlight of the evening. Qatar would have been 3-0 down after half-an-hour, but for some officiating which initially seemed to underline conspiracy theories about the bent-as-a-nine-bob-note nature of this whole event. \u2019s former   striker Enner Valencia was   - only to open the scoring from the penalty spot on 14 minutes and head a second on the half-hour. It was a nightmare start for Qatari keeper Saad Al Sheeb, who twice flapped horribly at a Pervis Estupinan free-kick, before Felix Torres hooked spectacularly across goal for Valencia to head in - only for a flag-waving R2:D2 to claim an offside against Michael Estrada. There was no escape for Qatar soon after, when Valencia was sent clean through and brought down by the hapless Al Sheeb, the ex-Hammer calmly slotting home himself - with Al Sheeb, predictably, going the wrong way. With the Qataris committing a catalogue of schoolboy errors, Valencia added his second when he was afforded a free header at the back stick to nod home a deep centre from Angelo Preciado. At least we had some amusing half-time entertainment as the Aussie stooge doing the PA duties claimed we had witnessed an \"even battle in the middle of the park\". If that extraordinary statement was designed to stop a half-time exodus, it didn\u2019t work. Renato Ibarra forced one decent save out of Al Sheeb but Ecuador almost seemed to lose interest in adding to their tally, with skipper Valencia withdrawn to save energy for the proper battles ahead. There was almost a minor sensation late on, when Qatar sub Mohammed Muntari fired a spectacular effort onto the roof of the net. But, when thousands of empty seats remained empty as the second half dragged on, there were false suggestions in the media box that many of the locals had gone away to pray. \"No,\" one Qatari journalist corrected us, \"they\u2019ve just gone.\""},

Speaking to  , Murphy said: \"Before the tournament, I was a little bit sceptical because of our recent form and the fact that we had a few injuries to key players, players in the squad that haven\u2019t been playing that much. \"When I say sceptical, I didn\u2019t think we would go out in the group, I wasn\u2019t convinced we had enough quality to win it.  \"Looking at what I\u2019ve already seen, there\u2019s nothing to fear.  \"We are capable of winning this  , that's for sure, and I didn't believe that until the last few days after seeing some of the teams that have been built up as favourites.  \"How many Argentina players would get in our team?

But despite this, England opted to continue taking the knee. Southgate explained: \"We feel we should. It's what we stand for as a team and have done for a long period of time. \"Of course, we understand in the Premier League that clubs have decided to only do that for certain games, big occasions, we feel this is the biggest. \"We think it is a strong statement to go around the world for young people in particular to see that inclusivity is very important.\" It remains to be seen as to what other nations, if any, will join England in the gesture during the World Cup."},

There\u2019s something the BBC thinks you\u2019re too sensitive to watch. Something involving Morgan Freeman, a member of the South Korean boyband BTS and a couple of camels. No. Not that. , from Qatar, a country that almost everyone agrees should never have been allowed to host the tournament, on account of corruption and human rights abuses. Whether this was the reason why the BBC didn\u2019t let us watch  , or allow three of its commentators to perform Wilson, \u00adKeppel & Betty\u2019s desert sand dance, in deep and \u00adreverent honour of the Islamic \u00adpeninsula, I cannot tell you. The Beeb rarely feels the need to explain these things to its licence-payers. Instead of the opening \u00adceremony and football chat, though, we were presented with a charge sheet by  : \u201cEver since Fifa chose Qatar, the smallest nation to have hosted football\u2019s greatest competition has faced some big questions, from accusations of corruption to the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums where many lost their lives. \u201c .\u201d Just as homosexuality was illegal in England when it hosted the tournament in 1966. Intuition tells me, though, that no matter how much the BBC loves judging and \u00adtrampling all over the past, that particular World Cup won\u2019t be written out of history. Similar instincts also lead me to think that if Harry Kane lifts the trophy on December 18, an estimated 6,500 dead migrant workers will be consigned to the \u00adfootnotes of this tainted \u00adtournament\u2019s history in the minds of nearly all senior BBC \u00adexecutives, whose compassion is almost certainly results-dependent. Still, if the BBC\u2019s lecture had begun and ended with Gary\u2019s opening statement, I don\u2019t think viewers would\u2019ve been quite so disgruntled as they were by the end of \u00adSunday evening\u2019s broadcast, because Gary wasn\u2019t the only one in serious mode. He was joined in Doha by  ,   and Ashley Williams. Back in the BBC studios, we had news heavyweights, like Jeremy Bowen, on hand to answer the question: \u201cHow significant is it for this tournament to be taking place in the Middle East?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s massive.\u201d Thanks, Jeremy. \u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a Before he cleared that one up, though, we were subjected to an incredibly po-faced lecture from reporter Ros Atkins, who took a forensic look at migrant worker deaths and warned us the carbon footprint of this tournament could be anywhere between 3.6million and 10million tonnes. There was, of course, an obvious and easy way of alleviating a \u00adsignificant chunk of this pollution.\u00a0 Auntie could have got Alan, Gary and the rest of the gang to stay at home and cover the tournament from Manchester. An entirely sensible move that would have also stopped cynics like me pointing out that the moment the BBC should have stopped lecturing about the evils of a process was the exact second it decided to become part of that process.  But, no, mob-handed and smug as ever, the BBC has decided it must be on the ground in  while still imagining itself to be mysteriously above everything and everyone.  Some credit, however, must go to Lineker who did at least raise the thorny question of \u201chypocrisy\u201d. Wisely, Shearer and \u00adWilliams kept their \u00adcounsel.\u00a0 Never one to miss an \u00adopportunity to \u00advirtue-signal, however, Alex Scott launched into a bleeding heart diatribe about Gianni Infantino\u2019s salary and migrant workers that included a quote from Nelson Mandela, which will have meant nothing much to anyone except herself. But it was enough to prompt Lineker into asking: \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \u201cI love my job,\u201d came the telling reply from Alex, who without this gig would be down to the bare bones of The One Show, Children In Need, Football Focus, The Tournament, The Games, Sports Personality Of The Year, The Wheel and \u00addozens of other essential cameos.\u00a0 It\u2019s a \u201cme-first\u201d approach that isn\u2019t unique to Alex, of course. For as the hastily abandoned plan to wear one-love armbands demonstrated, it\u2019s the grating contradiction that lies at the heart of almost every woke cultist on the planet and winds up the rest of us no end.\u00a0 \u2019Cos there\u2019s no gesture so empty they won\u2019t make it and no genuine self-sacrifice so small it won\u2019t make them go: \u201cHang on a second. What about me?\u201d INCIDENTALLY, in terms of deaf sub-titles, the most helpful World Cup performer so far has been Saad Al-Sheeb, who prompted this screen legend to appear: \u201cThat was more comfortable for our sheep in the Qatar goal.\u201d All other examples gratefully received.

And Matt Hancock received one from his \u00adconstituency chairman telling him to: \u201cGet your showboating ar*e back here now, you feckless moron.\u201d But only in my own imagination. In reality, he just got some gooey blah from his squeeze Gina Coladangelo that went down like one of Ant and Dec\u2019s Bum & Cola cocktails at the Bushtucker Trial\u2019s Speakeasy. That aside, though, I have almost nothing but praise to offer this year\u2019s series, where ITV finally threw significant money at some brilliant bookings \u2013  ,   and   \u2013 instead of an ITV2 spin-off show that you probably hadn\u2019t even noticed was missing.

Queiroz, who worked as Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s assistant manager at   has always ensured that his teams are notoriously difficult to break down. In 2018, Queiroz was also in charge when they conceded just two goals across their three games in the competition. Fast-forward to 2022 in Qatar,  have already conceded three times that amount.  were anything but tough to break through, proving to be incredibly permeable throughout. Most viewers expected the Three Lions to take all the points but perhaps not in the fashion that the game unfolded.  Let\u2019s deep-dive into how   tore Iran to shreds in Doha. Going into this game, based off of past evidence from the two nations\u2019 most recent fixtures, it was likely that England would be sent out to the pitch by Southgate in a 3-4-2-1 formation. This shape was deployed by the former   manager at Euro 2020 as well as the last round of the Nations League matches. Southgate favours this formation as it provides greater defensive balance, particularly by having someone like  as one of the three centre-backs, allowing the Man City man to mask the pace deficiency of or even Eric Dier when he plays. However, as confirmed by Southgate in his pre-match press conference at the weekend, England would be forced to make do without Walker against Iran. Rather than shoehorning another defender into a three-man defensive line, the manager switched the team\u2019s formation to a 4-3-3. He used   as the right-back with Maguire and John Stones operating as the heart of the backline. When England had possession in Iran\u2019s half and were looking to break down their low defensive block, the full-backs would push high, the wingers would move inside and play off Harry Kane. And crucially   also positioned himself in much more advanced areas of the pitch than his role in the 3-4-2-1 allows. Bellingham made numerous runs into the penalty area, showcasing his true box-to-box capabilities. At Borussia Dortmund, the teenager is normally positioned on the right of a three-man midfield,  . Normally in Southgate\u2019s 3-4-2-1, Bellingham plays in a double-pivot alongside Rice and practically has a leash around him, limiting how far up the pitch he can move due to the risk of leaving his midfield partner overloaded in the middle of the park. The ex-Birmingham City academy product has enjoyed some wonderful performances alongside Rice in a two-man partnership. But he seems far more comfortable in a three when he is allowed to be a threat in the penalty area.  His goal came from this exact situation. England\u2019s shift from a 3-4-2-1 to a 4-3-3 was not the only surprise of the World Cup clash. Under Queiroz, during their pre-tournament friendlies,   have typically lined up in a 4-3-3 which drops into a mean 4-1-4-1 defensive block out of possession. The Portuguese pragmatist is rather rigid in his tactical approach and so it was a shock to see Iran take to the field in a 5-4-1 shape. There was a clear attempt from the nation\u2019s longest-serving manager to make it even more difficult for England to break them down by throwing in an extra man in the backline.  This turned out to be a mistake by the coach. Nonetheless, the team\u2019s approach was not so shocking.  Iran\u2019s defensive line was incredibly low as they looked to soak up pressure from England and hit Southgate\u2019s men on the break.  In theory, this seems like a perfectly acceptable tactic, but the team\u2019s execution was ghastly. Rightly or wrongly,   has received immense criticism from Manchester United fans, England supporters and pundits ever since the beginning of the 2021-22 campaign after Euro 2020. The defender has even been dropped by his club manager Erik ten Hag for some dreadful performances since the start of the current season. During the Nations League fixtures a few weeks back, the United skipper was certainly ropey and even gave away a penalty against Germany for a sloppy tackle inside the box. Nonetheless, Southgate still picked the most expensive defender of all time in his World Cup squad heading to Qatar.   proved the England boss right. One of the keys to picking apart any deep defensive block is reaching your attacking players between the lines.  The likes of Mason Mount, Kane and Raheem Sterling are excellent in pockets of space between the opposition\u2019s midfield and defence. Southgate trusted both Maguire and Stones to play these passes, bypassing Iran\u2019s frontline and midfield to reach this area of the pitch. In fact, England\u2019s opening goal came from this exact situation after a relatively tedious 35 minutes without creating many clear-cut opportunities. England were patient, cautiously passing the ball around the back, waiting for the perfect moment to find one of the attackers between the lines. From there, they would up the tempo and either move the ball out wide to the highly-positioned full-backs or try and slip runners in behind.\u00a0 For the most part, the former option reaped delicious fruits as England created numerous chances from the wide areas and even bagged two assists from this region of the pitch. It\u2019s fair to say that were no real underperformers for England during their opening game of the group. There were some truly scintillating displays from many key players, especially in attack.  However, one player who seemingly went under the radar for their sumptuous performance for the Three Lions was West Ham skipper Declan Rice.  at the World Cup, and indeed in Europe overall, and the 23-year-old showcased this against Iran. The role of a  No6 in a 4-3-3 is of utmost importance as it allows the two advanced midfielders to push forward and get involved in the attack while the single pivot remains deeper, helping to circulate the ball around as well as protecting the backline. Iran\u2019s game plan was to try and pick their moments to counterattack, meaning Rice had to be prepared for when these transitional moments occurred. The Hammers man was vital to stifling Team Melli during these situations as Queiroz\u2019s men rarely got past the halfway line from their counterattacks from deep. Nevertheless, Rice\u2019s importance was not just out of possession when Iran would attempt to hit England on the break.  He was also integral for Southgate\u2019s side to be able to spread the ball around, particularly to the wide areas. Often, the Chelsea target would drop deep alongside the centre-backs to pick up possession of the ball while also constantly screening the centre-backs to receive with his back turned to goal. Furthermore, Rice continuously played long passes out to Kieran Trippier and Luke Shaw when they were high up the pitch, offering easy access for England to reach the final third and put crosses into the box from which they scored twice. Many people\u2019s opinions will have changed on England\u2019s chances of going far in this  . Southgate has been heavily criticised in the past for the team\u2019s rather pragmatic approach in games despite having a wealth of exciting, attacking talent at his disposal. This eight-goal thriller proved that the 52-year-old is capable of playing expansive football. However, it is also quite difficult to gauge just how good England are given that Iran made the game far from competitive.\u00a0 The real test for the Three Lions will be whether or not they can hold and candle to some of the other favourites to win the competition, providing they qualify for the knockout phase, although this 6-2 victory has definitely gone a long way to ensure that they do."},

From Cabinet minister at the forefront of pandemic strategy to disgraced breaker of his own Covid rules ( ), there was no way this was going to go well. Right? Wrong. At the time of writing (a few hours is a long time in politics) the former Health Secretary appears to have gone from zero to, not quite hero but, at the very least, someone who cheerfully gives everything a go, is admirably competent and doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously. He is proving himself to be that something the British adore: A good sport. At the start, he said he wanted to show people what he was really like and was there for \u201c \u201d. A bold aim, but it might just be working, for many of the online messages of denigration at the start have now largely morphed in to \u201cTeam  \u201d.  In fact, his appearance on the show so far has been such a resounding success that one suspects plenty of other MPs are now on speed dial to their aides, demanding \u201cI\u2019m A Politician, Get Me In There\u201d for the next series. For the record, I don\u2019t think reality television is the place for an MP who should rightly be back in the UK serving his constituents during these tough times.

As proved by the MP for Have I Got News For You (aka  ) an entertaining TV appearance can reach the parts of voters that no amount of podium-clutching speeches can.

It was Prime Minister Anthony Eden, and Attenborough recalls turning up at Downing Street to find the PM in bed, \u201clooking dreadful, in his pyjamas\u201d, with pill bottles lined up next to him and his wife applying mascara to his moustache. More accustomed to speaking on the radio and not having to worry about what he looked like, Eden was nervous and it showed. Compared to younger politicians who began embracing TV as a way to get their message across to the masses, he never mastered the art before he resigned with ill health the following year. So the power of being relaxed on camera cannot be underestimated, and perhaps  \u2019s foray in to reality TV is the next logical step for all government wannabes. Hell, let\u2019s just go the whole hog and make the next general election a televised experiment where all contenders are put through a set of Bushtucker Trials to see what they\u2019re made of.

The dad, from Dereham, will be watching all three of England's group stage matches at the   which  He is one of an estimated 250 people on a \"top capper\" scheme which means he gets priority tickets for England's biggest clashes. So loyal to the cause is Ian that he once took seven hours to get his body painted with the St George's flag for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The World Cup in Qatar will see Ian attend his fifth international tournament in total. His first England game was back when he was a kid in 1984 when the Three Lions faced off against Yugoslavia. Ian says that he used to be more into his club football, but after becoming more financially stable he has been exclusively focusing on England for the past 15 years. He said: \"I don't think I've missed an England home game in around 13 years. Wherever England go in the UK I go. \"Qualifiers and friendlies, I haven't missed an away game in 11 years. \"I've been to the Euros in France in 2016 and supported the boys all the way in Russia.\" He added: \"I'm considered a 'top capper' so whenever England play I'm guaranteed a ticket. I love supporting my country. \"It's not physically possible currently to have more live caps than I have got. I'm so proud to be English, always have been.\" Ian flies home from Qatar on December 5, with a view to coming back if England reach the semi-final and final. The devout fan has travelled thousands of miles around the globe to support his country, and he says he loves visiting different parts of the world. Qatar will be the 66th country he has visited in the name of football. He will be staying in an apartment, a short metro ride outside of the capital city of Doha. \"It's a bit unusual to have a Winter World Cup but it's about the football spectacle at the end of the day. \"I'm sure there will be some phenomenal games, I'm there to support and get behind my team. \"I'm excited for it, I know there's a lot of bad press about how they got the tournament but every country has it issues. \"Look at Russia four years ago, I was there and there were things corrupt about that. They were invading Ukraine long before what happened this year.  \"I've never been to this part of the world much so I am excited for it.\" He added how he was keen to meet supporters of other nationalities and would always respect the host country's culture. Ian said: \"I'm well travelled and I do respect other cultures. I'm an atheist and I'll respect their religion. \"There are pubs and stuff I think it is a lot better than people realise and I'm happy to wait til when I need to to have my drink. \"I love to meet new people, other fans and understand where people come from. Ian continued: \"I'm not a fan of those who go to the football but are really hooligans who care more about throwing bottles than supporting the lads - it gives England fans a bad rep. \"I like to have a drink but when I finish a can or bottle the last thing on my mind is to smash it against a wall or lob it. \"Unfortunately there's always a few idiots taking it too far. I don't like that element of following England but I'll represent my country in the best way possible. \"I'm old school, I'm there to enjoy the game and feel no need to boo another team's national anthem for example.\" The footie-mad fan has also nabbed tickets to watch other games at the World Cup such as Brazil vs Cameroon, Spain vs Costa Rica, and Uruguay vs South Korea. He will be visiting nearly every stadium in Qatar to fully immerse himself in the magic of the World Cup. As an England fan, every game you attend you get a cap - and Ian has already booked tickets for next year including Malta and Moldova away. \"It goes in my diary before anything else, I love football and travelling so much - I'm footie mad! \"I have a load of passport stamps tattooed on me.\" And although Ian loves the beautiful game, it does come as a hefty cost. He reckons that his trip will cost him around \u00a38,000 if England get all the way to the final. But if the Three Lions crash out earlier he estimates the figure will end up around \u00a35,000. Despite his dedication, Ian does not fancy the men\u2019s team to win their second World Cup and believes after a semi-final, and final showing in the last two tournaments, it is \"do or die\" for Gareth Southgate. He said: \u201cAs much as I love England, I don't think we will win. I rank our chances as very slim, but I felt that going out to Russia. \u201cI've stood by Gareth but the last result was a disgrace, it's do or die for him.\u201d Ian sports a Three Lions tattoo with the inking on his leg but hopes to update it this summer. \"My tattoo only has one star, I hope to add to it this time, fingers crossed.\" Speaking about his most memorable moments watching England, Ian cites the penalty shoot-out victory over Colombia during the 2018 World Cup as one of his personal highlights. He was also present in that delirious summer of 2021 when England knocked fierce rivals Germany out of the Euros. Outside of his Three Lions commitments Ian is a busy man, frequently running marathons and contributing to charity. He is the co-founder of the Dereham Ukraine aid Centre and has run over 200 marathons."},

Over the last twenty years, Japan\u2019s victory over Colombia in Russia 2018 is the only time that Asia has got the best of South America in a  . The next best effort is Japan\u2019s game against Paraguay in 2010, where a goalless draw was followed by a win for the South Americans on penalties. And with Japan this time in a group together with  , Spain and Costa Rica, the way is clear for the South Americans to get off to a flying start. South Korea might give Uruguay a game on Thursday, but Argentina are firm favourites against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and Ecuador already have three points in the bag after Sunday\u2019s opening encounter with Qatar. Criticism started raining down on the Qatar team long before the final whistle blew in   where they failed to muster a single shot on target. The occasion was clearly too big for them. But that is not the whole story. After all, this is a very young Ecuador side, in which only the goalscorer Enner Valencia has previous World Cup experience.\u00a0 Ecuador could easily have found it all a bit too much.\u00a0 But they didn\u2019t. They played to potential and the problem for   is that Ecuador are not easy to play against. After recent meetings in World Cup qualification and in last year\u2019s Copa America, the Brazil coaching staff have been convinced for some time that Ecuador could be one of the surprise sides in this World Cup.\u00a0  The reasons were clear from the initial game of the tournament. Rushed in from Argentina a month before the start of the qualifiers, with no previous connection to Ecuadorian football, coach Gustavo Alfaro has been doing a wonderful job.\u00a0  And he got the call right on Sunday. Typically  . For the Qatar game he switched to a 4-4-2 for a couple of reasons. Firstly, his side have been struggling for goals.  He felt he could have some joy against the Qatar defence playing directly up to a pair of centre forwards. And secondly he had seen that Qatar love to pay long diagonal passes to their attacking wing backs.  Selecting a pair of wingers who were prepared to work back had the effect of closing down the space.\u00a0 There was the danger that the two central midfielders could be isolated, and a possession-based Qatar side would be able to play around them.  But it is here that the pace of the Ecuadorian defenders is so valuable. Coach Alfaro is delighted that his side can defend even higher than Brazil - and a high line enables the team to stay compact, with a number of players around the ball when the opponent\u2019s move breaks down. Brazil found Ecuador very hard to play against - an organised team with plenty of power and pace, and no little skill as well.  And if it was tough for Brazil, it proved too much for Qatar. The World Cup hosts are well coached - the team that lost on Sunday acquitted itself well three years ago in the Copa America, holding Paraguay to a draw and going down to narrow defeats against Colombia and  . The World Cup, though, is at a different level, and so were Ecuador. Once they had run the nerves out of their system in the second half, Qatar were able to string some passes together.  But they could never compete against Ecuador in physical terms, and the South American press always looked likely to produce a third goal. With Senegal and Holland to come, things will get more difficult for the Ecuadorians. For the moment, though, they can bask in the global gaze.  All the way from the equator, the men from the middle of the world enjoyed being the centre of everyone\u2019s attention."},

However, she would have been left devastated by her nations'   at the hands of Saudi Arabia. The River Plate fan has amassed almost 250,000 followers on Instagram. And, judging by a stunt she pulled off in 2017, should   be in dire need of inspiration - Melisia will be sure to come up with a plan. After River crashed to a 3-0 first leg defeat in the Copa Libertadores quarter-final in 2017 to Bolivian team Club Deportivo Jorge Wilstermann, she came up with a novel way to gee up her team. Desperate to see her team progress, and knowing they needed a pick-me-up, she reportedly sent the players a saucy video that left little to the imagination. Needless to say, the trick worked a treat. River, astonishingly, won 8-0 in the return leg to reach the semi-finals, where they were eventually eliminated by Lanus. Lionel Messi and Co should check their social media inboxes now. If that wasn't enough, before   Copa Libertadores quarter-final Melisia was feeling strangely superstitious. She revealed she would be entrusting the help of her lucky knickers in the hope that River would over-turn the three goal deficit. Melisia even told fans online that if River were victorious, she would auction off the underwear to one of her followers. However, despite that threat Melisia might've got\u00a0 . It was never confirmed whether a fan received her knickers. Probably best better not knowing. When she's not following River or Argentina, influencer Melisia is crafting a career in music. The blonde bombshell has released a number of singles in her homeland, independently. Her Reggaeton beats feature in songs called Hasta Abajo (Drop it the floor) and El Perdon (Forgiveness). If you're an Argentina fan right now, at least this influencer can provide the perfect distraction until the next game."},

Iran has arrested more than 15,000 protesters and killed almost 400 in an uprising over women's rights over the  .  Mahsa is believed to have been beaten to death while in police custody for wearing an \"improper\" hijab.  The regime's brutal crackdown has only strengthened the resolve of people standing against them - with calls now for an end to the brutal regime ruled by the Ayatollah.  Iran is also known to have been backing Russia in its vicious war on Ukraine - providing Vladimir Putin's military with   used to blitz civilians.  And while Iran takes to the field today, back home the protests and the oppression continues.  Hassan told The Sun Online: \"The Iranian team recently went to meet with the Supreme Leader, which has angered millions.\" He went on: \"This Iranian team has been suppressed, and have given up.  \"I hope the players will side with the Iranian people, and not with the government.\" Hassan fled Iran after the revolution in 1979 which saw the overthrow of the Shah's dictatorship overthrown and replaced with the fundamentalist Islamic regime. Young Iranians are sacrificing their lives for freedom, but even though the regime can kill them, it can't stop this movement He is now an opposition activist who joined the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI),\u00a0which is a leading opposition group, and has been living in exile ever since, with two of his family\u00a0members killed by the regime. Hassan moved to England and studied at the University of Sussex.  The footie legend and his colleagues recently attempted to urge FIFA boss Gianni Infantino to sanction Iran.  Iranian officials also haven't hesitated to kill some of its best football players, such as former captain Habib Khabiri. He was tortured and executed by firing squad after he was found to be a member of the PMOI.  Hassan hopes the end could be near for the regime.  \"Young Iranians are sacrificing their lives for freedom, but even though the regime can kill them, it can't stop this movement,\" he told The Sun Online.  \"We need freedom of choice, freedom of dress, freedom of religion.

They have more problems than the Shah faced.  \"Sanctions, siding with the Russians, and 95% of ordinary Iranians hate them.  \"I am 74, but I will live to see the downfall of this religious dictatorship.\" Speaking about his time at the World Cup, he recalled how the Iranian FA at the time was controlled by the Shah's military and the secret police. But he struck up a good relationship with the national team coach, former Manchester United player Frank O'Farrell.  \"The dictatorship politicised football,\" said Hassan. \"On a flight back from a training match in France ahead of the 1978 World Cup, we told coaches that if you don't support our families, we won't go to the tournament. \"The World Cup was an extraordinary experience, it was the first time Iran had gone to the tournament, and there were only 16 teams.  \"We played the Netherlands who were the best team in the world at that time. \"For us, going to the World Cup, we were a young team, it was a great adventure, and we met some of the best players of the international game. \"I became friends with some of them including Archie Gemmill from Scotland. \"For the people of Iran, it was making history. \"Football is about playing as a collective, but also with a sense of freedom, which is why I love it so much.\" \n"},
{"title": "Iran players could face punishment, prison or DEATH after REFUSING to sing anthem before World Cup game vs England", "author": "Henry Holloway", "date": "21 Nov 2022", "content": "IRANIAN players who bravely refused to sing their national anthem could face punishment, prison or even the death penalty when they return home.  The   XI stood tall but silent as the anthem played and boos rained down from their own fans ahead of their clash with England at the Khalifa International\u00a0Stadium\u00a0in Doha. Iranian fans in the   stadium were moved to tears by the incredible gesture as massive protests continue to sweep the Islamic Republic.  And it came after many fans back home accused the squad of siding with a violent state crackdown ahead of the  .  But the Iranian team's gesture could land them in an awful lot of trouble back home should the regime decide to make an example of them.  Political dissent is a crime in Iran - and is one of the offences subject to capital punishment, with 21 protesters already facing execution after sham trials since the start of the uprising in September.  Iranian officials had already been discussing cracking down on perceived disrespect to their national anthem and flag ahead of the World Cup.  And the national team's defiance on such an international scale will spark fury amongst the regime - and could spark retribution. Massoud Setayeshi, spokesman for the Iran's Judiciary, said just days ago that punishments could be meted out for those who reject the anthem.  Iranian courts have been taking a brutal line on people linked to the protests, with more than 15,000 people arrested and hundreds killed by the security forces.  And just last month, teenager Asra Panahi was beaten to death after she reportedly refused to sing a pro-government anthem.  State news agencies also reported just ten days ago an Iranian cleric during prayers called on athletes who disrespect the anthem to face punishment.  Iran's current president is  Ebrahim Raisi - who is known as \"The Butcher\" for his role in the massacre of thousands of protesters in 1988.  However, Iran has shown restraint in recent months - opting not punish climber Elnaz Rekabi\u00a0who competed without the nation's mandatory hijab. And the Iranian men's water polo team - who also refused to sing the anthem - have also so-far gone unpunished.    of the ruling regime have gripped Iran since the death two months ago of young woman  . She was arrested and allegedly beaten to death for flouting the strict Islamic dress code. Dozens of Iranian public figures, athletes and artists have displayed solidarity with the protesters. But there was anger as the national team remained in a state of silence.  The players however turned this silence into a gesture ahead of their game with England as they refused to sing the national anthem.  I know it is their job to play football but with all those children killed in Iran, they should have stood in solidarity with the people Iranian state television did not show the players lined up for the anthem before the match got underway just across the Gulf. The Iranian squad could not avoid being overshadowed by the anti-government unrest that has rattled the regime.  Ahead of the match, no Iranian player had voiced support for the demonstrations by compatriots from all walks of life. It is one of the most sustained challenges to the cleric elite since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \"All of us are sad because our people are being killed in Iran but all of us are proud of our team because they did not sing the national anthem - because it's not our national (anthem), it's only for the regime,\" said one Iranian fan.  In the past, the Iranian team was a source of fired up national pride.  Now, with mass protests, many would prefer it withdrew from the World Cup. Before travelling to Doha the team met with hardline Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.  Photos of the players with Raisi, one of them bowing in front of him, went viral while the street unrest raged on, drawing an outcry on social media. \"I have mixed feelings. I love football but with all these children, women and men killed in Iran, I think the national team should not play,\" said Iran fan Elmira, 24.  \"It is not Iran's team, it is the Islamic Republic's team.\" \"They could refuse to take part in the World Cup or even refuse to play if they were forced to go, to show that they are part of the nation, to show solidarity with mothers in Iran whose children were killed by the regime (during protests).\" The activist HRANA news agency said 410 protesters had been killed in the unrest as of Saturday, including 58 minors. Some 54 members of the security forces had also been killed, HRANA said, with at least 17,251 people arrested. Authorities have not provided an estimate of any wider death count. \"I know it is their job to play football but with all those children killed in Iran, they should have stood in solidarity with the people,\" said Iran fan Setareh, 17.  \"Especially when the   (in solidarity), how can the national team show no solidarity?\" Some Iranian fans who went to Qatar for the World Cup made no secret of their solidarity with the unrest. They carried banners that read \"Women, Life, Freedom\" in support of the protests.  \"Freedom for Iran. Stop killing children in the streets!\" shouted one Iranian woman. Another Iranian woman with the colours of an Iranian flag painted on her face said Iran is a football-crazed nation. \"But this year,\" she said, \"everything is different, all we care about is this revolution and for people to get their freedom back, and not be scared to just walk on the street, do and dress as they want, and say what they want.\" In the capital Tehran, some banners of the national team have been burned by angry protesters. Pictures of children killed in the protests were widely shared by Iranians on Twitter, with messages such as: \"They loved football too, but they were killed by the Islamic Republic.\" \"Those children took risks for their country and were killed by the regime. The national team should take risks and show solidarity with the nation,\" said Iran fan Hamidreza, 19. Pejman Zarji, a 38-year-old sports coach who was in Qatar for the World Cup, said the Iranian team belonged to the people not the government. He said: \"There is always - no matter what - a part that's about politics.  \"There's something really important to understand (now) - 'Team Melli' is what we call the Iran team, it's the team of the people before being the team of the government. Sara Masoudi, 32, another Iranian fan in Qatar who works for a media management company, played down the protests at home.  They were \"very small\" but the media made them out to be large, she told Reuters. \"I don't see a lot of fans here who are supporters of the protests.

The match will see a key battle of the strikers, with Barcelona's   lining up against Wolves' Raul Jimenez. Both are aiming to bag their first World Cup goals - having failed to do so in three previous games each. Here, SunSport previews the clash that will have an enormous impact on which of these sides will make it through from Group C.  Gerardo Martino's side qualified via the Concacaf route. Through their Fifa ranking they received a bye to the third round of qualifying, before being pitted in a group alongside Canada, the US, Costa Rica, Panama, Jamaica, El Salvador and Honduras. Eight wins, four draws and two defeats were enough to take Mexico through in second place behind leaders Canada.  Lewandowski and Co required the play-offs to get through to the finals in Qatar, despite eight group stage goals by the   star. After finishing second to   in Group I, Poland drew Russia in their Path B play-off semi-final. They were awarded a bye after Russia were thrown out following their invasion of Ukraine - before beating Sweden 2-0 in the final via goals by Lewandowski and Piotr Zielinski.  Gerardo Martino's men have played two warm-up matches for the World Cup, with mixed results. They comfortably beat underdogs Iraq 4-0 on November 9, before falling 2-1 to Sweden a week later.

Martino also has plenty of experience in club football, including a season at Barcelona.  Czeslaw Michniewicz only took charge of Poland in January of this year. Predecessor Paulo Sousa left to take the Flamengo job, with Michniewicz subsequently tasked with overseeing the play-offs.

Fans of the legendary No10 will find it difficult not to let their minds drift to next month's final, which will take place in the very same venue 26 days on from Argentina's opener. But  , 35, is wily enough to know that games against sides like Saudi Arabia can be awkward - and must be treated with respect in order to win a tournament. Finally winning his first piece of international silverware at last year's Copa America was a huge monkey off the   star's back. And Argentina fans hope that will give him extra belief going into the World Cup in Qatar. Here, SunSport previews the clash that could see Messi and Co stake their claim to be tournament favourites.  Lionel Scaloni's side comfortably qualified by finishing as runners-up in the Conmebol qualifying group. A final record of 11 wins, six draws and no defeats did the job - although there was controversy along the way. Their clash with Brazil was   last year when health officials ran onto the pitch accusing four of their players of breaking Covid protocols. Much haggling over a new date for the game followed - before it was eventually cancelled altogether when both country's qualifications made it a dead rubber.  Managed by suave international football legend Herve Renard, winner of two Afcons - Saudi Arabia qualified for Qatar with flying colours. They received a bye through the initial phase of Asian qualifying, before topping a group featuring Uzbekistan, Palestine, Singapore and Yemen. This success got them into the third and final stage - where a record of seven wins, two draws and one defeat was enough to qualify them alongside Japan from a group also featuring Australia, Oman, China and Vietnam.  The Albiceleste could hardly be in better shape, going into the   on a 36-game unbeaten run. In fact, you have to go all the way back to the Copa America 2019 semi-finals for their last defeat - when they lost 2-0 to Brazil. Since then they have qualified for this tournament unbeaten, as well as winning Copa America and Finalissima trophies. In their final pre-World Cup friendly they easily beat the United Arab Emirates 5-0.  Renard's men possess a mixed record in 2022 with only one thing certain - their games don't produce many goals. Of their 13 matches played during this calendar year,  have featured more than two successful strikes. They lost 1-0 to Croatia in their final pre-World Cup friendly, holding off 2018's finalists until the 82nd minute.

Who are the  Who are the  Meet   who are staying on a \u00a31bn cruise ship The Albiceleste have been managed by former   defender Lionel Scaloni since 2018. In that time, the 44-year-old guided them to their first trophy in   - tasting glory at the Copa America 2021. Prior to landing the gig, Scaloni had been assistant to Jorge Sampaoli.  A smooth operator around the international game, Frenchman Herve Renard certainly experienced an eclectic career prior to taking the Saudi job in 2019. The 54-year-old's early club career featured stints in the French lower leagues, as well as brief stays at Cambridge United and Vietnamese side Nam Dinh. He made his name in the international game by winning Afcon with both Zambia and the Ivory Coast - also managing Morocco, as well as Sochaux and Lille in Ligue 1. LIONEL MESSI is aiming to finally complete his career clean sweep by lifting the World Cup at his fifth attempt in Qatar. The 35-year-old has previously come as close as the final, losing 1-0 to Germany after extra time in 2014. Despite his advancing years, the 165-cap star has been in sparkling form for his club this season. The Paris Saint-Germain star has scored 12 goals and assisted a further 14 in 19 appearances for his club this term.  SALEM AL-DAWSARI is set to be his country's talisman once again at this winter's World Cup finals in Qatar. The attacker was a key man in 2018, scoring his side's last minute winner against Egypt during the group stage. Al-Dawsari, 31, has played almost the entirety of his career at Saudi heavyweights Al-Hilal - scoring 79 goals and laying on 62 assists in 309 games - winning the Asian Champions League twice in the process. He had a brief spell in Spain in 2018, playing once on loan at Villarreal. Argentina wins: 2 Draws: 2 Saudi Arabia wins: 0 ITV1 will broadcast the match with a 10am kick-off on Tuesday. There will also be a live stream on ITV Hub. Argentina win: 1/7 Draw: 6/1 Saudi Arabia: 20/1 Argentina are obviously huge favourites, but Saudi Arabia will be organised and resolute in their attempts to keep them out. We expect Messi and Co to still win fairly comfortably... but the Saudis' 2022 form suggests that there won't be more than two goals in it."},

They only confirmed their ticket to Qatar in June after beating Saudi Arabia and then Peru in World Cup play-off matches.  : Les Blues have been in patchy form for most of the year, winning just three of their eight games in 2022 as Didier Deschamps experiments with a new formation. They lost their most recent game in the UEFA Nations League 2-0 to Denmark and narrowly avoided relegation to the second tier.  : The Aussies were one of the last teams to make it to the World Cup but have enjoyed strong recent form despite a rough start to 2022.  They have won each of their last five games which has included both World Cup qualifiers and a pair of friendlies against New Zealand. : Didier Deschamps has been in charge of the French team for an entire decade now.  He took over in 2012 and has overseen the creation of a global superpower - much like the France side he was in as a player which won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship.

In 2019 Australia crashed out of the quarter-finals of the Asia Cup despite being the reigning champions. : KYLIAN MBAPPE will once again be likely to make the headlines as he takes an even more prominent role in Didier Deschamps side than the one he did in 2018. The PSG superstar was France's top scorer alongside Antoine Griezmann in Russia.  And with Karim Benzema ruled out of the squad the onus will once again fall on Mbappe to score the goals for Les Blues. It truly is a testament to the quality of players from France that despite missing a host of big names likes Ballon d'Or winner Benzema plus midfield mainstays Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kante they still have a squad spilling over with quality.  : AARON MOOY will likely be the man tasked with trying to lead Australia to the latter stages. The Socceroos have only made it past the group stage of the World Cup on one occasion - 2006 - and the difficult group they have landed in means their hopes of doing so again look bleak.  But former Huddersfield midfielder Mooy will be looked to to make sure Australia both defend stoutly and attack with creativity.

Should Paulo Dybala miss out on the World Cup through injury, the Argies will still have a player who dates a huge South American pop star. Dybala famously courts Argentina's answer to Katy Perry, Oriana Sabatini. His team-mate Rodrigo de Paul is with her pop rival, TINI - who has a staggering 19million Instagram followers, Better known as Martina Stoessel, the 26-year-old is also a Disney Channel star in Latin America.

It is the latest incident of bullish policing at the   as overzealous security officials come under scrutiny for hassling reporters and seizing rainbow flags from fans.  Video shows a tall man in Arabic robes with an official pass hanging from his chest confronting   journalist Joaquin Alvarez. Alvarez was interviewing a woman in a wheelchair when the   official interrupted with security guards in tow.  Colleagues from the studio back in Buenos Aires said: \u201cThis is what the Qatar government is like.\"  The shock incident took place during a live report for a popular show on Argentina\u2019s El Trece channel called Nosotros a la Ma\u00f1ana. It occured  after a   on air as they broadcast in the capital Doha ahead of the World Cup. Alvarez, who normally hosts the programme, was joking with Argentine fans about their favourite TV channel and the show they like the best when he was interrupted by the man. As the camera pans round during the incident, two other men appearing to be security staff can also be seen. He was forced to stop and show he was working seconds after a wheelchair-bound supporter he was fooling around with.  Alvarez said he was \u201csad\u201d about the South American nation\u2019s shock defeat to Saudi Arabia. The shock interruption to the live broadcast took place in Barwa Village, a commercial and residential complex on the outskirts of Doha that has been expanded for the World Cup. The journalist and film crew resumed filming later from the back of a car, with Alvarez telling viewers he had been forced to leave the area after being told where he was working was \u201cprivate.\u201d Insisting his paperwork was in order and he had all the necessary permits, he said: \u201cI was frightened and thought they were going to take me prisoner. \u201cThe person who stopped the filming got out of a van and told us in a very rude way we couldn\u2019t film any more because we were in a private place. \u201cI told him we were showing something nice but they told us we had to go and there was a moment when they even wanted to take our equipment off us.\u201d He went on to thank well-wishers for their support in a social media post, raging: \u201cWe had a bad experience and what happened was totally unfair because we had all our permits and everything in order.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s in the past now, another anecdote. The most important thing for me is that Argentina is playing again on Saturday.\u201d Nicolas Magali, who is replacing Alvarez as programme host while his colleague covers the World Cup, responded by saying: \u201cThis is an example of severe censorship and we have to say so. \u201cThey covered up the camera, didn\u2019t let us film, ordered you away in a rude fashion and on top of that the person doing the talking didn\u2019t identify himself.\u201d The journalist\u2019s wife Tefi Russo later took to social media to say of her husband: \u2018No joke, he sh#t himself simply because although he had all his paperwork in order, he\u2019s away from home, he was doing a live broadcast, he doesn\u2019t speak the language, it\u2019s another culture and it\u2019s censorship when you know you\u2019re doing nothing wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to work and enjoy a World Cup like this.\u201d Qatari officials ended up apologising after a similar incident less than a fortnight ago involving the Danish film crew.\u00a0 TV2 reporter Rasmus Tantholdt was speaking as part of a live broadcast when he was approached by security staff who had appeared on a golf buggy next to the newly-opened Chedi Hotel at Katara Cultural Village. Tantholdt displayed his accreditation before accusing the henchman of wanting to break camera equipment.\u00a0 He later said he had been given an apology by the Qatar Supreme Committee, the body which is organising the World Cup. Qatar has already faced questions over organisation of the World Cup \u2013 with reports weeks before the start that the nation simply was not ready. Confusion over the\u00a0 , infrastructure problems and reports of\u00a0 \u00a0have already surfaced.

At 37, surely this is his final global tournament - but that will not stop the unemployed veteran desperately trying to make his mark in the Middle East.  Two of the records   was eyeing heading into the tournament were ticked off against Ghana. By starting the match, he became just the fifth man to appear in five  , having made his debut way back in 2006. Ronaldo joined Mexican duo Antonio Carbajal and Rafael Marquez as well as German icon Lothar Matthaus and  . But one record he now has over Messi at the World Cup is the number of tournaments he has scored at. The Argentine's penalty against Saudi Arabia ensured he has scored at four of those five World Cups - the same number as Pele, Uwe Seeler and Miroslav Klose.  But while he failed to find the net in South Africa 12 years ago, Ronaldo has had no such trouble and therefore   saw him become the first man to score at five World Cups. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner will not be able to match Matthaus' haul of 25 World Cup matches. He went into 2022 with 17 appearances - so even reaching the final and featuring in all seven possible ties would leave him one short of the record.  , though, could snatch it outright if he plays in every game including the final.  Ronaldo, though, already holds the record for the most World Cup appearances for a Portuguese player. And another goal in this tournament would see him draw level with   legend Eusebio on nine World Cup goals - two more and he holds the national record.  However, it would take a truly sensational month for Ronaldo to get the overall World Cup record.   Klose leads the way on 16, double the number Ronaldo has managed so far.  Messi, meanwhile, has seven goals in 20 World Cup matches for Argentina, three shy of Gabriel Batistuta's tally. "},

But before getting too ahead of themselves, Brazil must find a way to navigate a particularly tricky group, featuring Serbia, Switzerland and Cameroon. Up first, it's potential dark horses   - as SunSport takes a look at everything you need to know before the big game. : Topped the outrageously-tough South American table with 14 wins from their 17 games, drawing three with   losses.

Serbia, tipped as dark horses for the 2022 tournament in Qatar, beat Portugal to top spot to avoid the need for a play-off. : Well, they've won every match since   when they were held 1-1 by Ecuador in a feisty encounter. Incredibly, their most-recent defeat came in the Copa America final in July 2021. They beat Ghana 3-0 and Tunisia 5-1 in September, with both those teams in this winter's tournament. : Thumped Bahrain 5-1 in their pre-tournament warm-up match on the back of a strong Nations League campaign.

Sikazwe has been appointed to officiate   at the winter World Cup in Qatar. But after becoming a worldwide story due to farcical scenes in the match between Tunisia and Mali at AFCON, all eyes will be on the Zambian to see what he does next. \n A familiar face to fans of African football over the past decade, Sikazwe was born in Kapiri Mposhi in 1979. After receiving his Fifa licence in 2010, he first progressed through international youth matches before taking charge of African Cup of Nations qualifiers in 2012. Since then he has moved up the ranks and has a reputation for being a leniant ref who likes the game to flow. But controversy reigned when  . When Sergio Ramos brought down an opponent having already been booked, the Zambian reached for a second yellow card and called the Galacticos captain over. But he then put his hand back in his pocket and bizarrely chose not to send Ramos off.  and as he misheard his assistant over his earpiece, thinking he had called for a card when he actually said \"foul, no card\". He officiated two games at the 2018 World Cup - Belgium v Panama and Japan v Poland. - but was the subject of more controversy later that year. Sikazwe was temporarily suspended on suspicion of corruption after his handling of an African Champions League match between Esperance and Primiero Agosto. He gave a controversial penalty for Esperance before ruling out a goal for their opponents due to a perceived foul on the keeper. The suspension by CAF was imposed in November 2018 but lifted just three months later by FIFA. Security were forced to race on to the pitch to protect the referee after a  Sikazwe endured an horrific afternoon as he gave two controversial penalties, a questionable red card and  \u00a0ended the game early. He first awarded a penalty early in the second half after Ellyes Skhiri was deemed to have blocked Boubakar Kouyate's shot with his arm. Sikazwe awarded another penalty with just 15 minutes on the clock after Wahbi Khazri's shot smacked into Moussa Djenepo's hand. The ref originally missed the handball and needed VAR to bail him out. Incredibly, Sikazwe then blew for full time on just\u00a0 - before enraged Tunisia officials pointed out his simply bizarre error. Sikazwe then sent off sub El Bilal Toure two minutes later for a slightly late challenge which was worthy of a yellow card at worst. He was instructed by VAR to look at it again, but after a glance at the pitchside video screen, he stuck by his decision. And to make matters worse, he then called for the end of the game early\u00a0 . The players left the field and it did for a time look like play could resume, but eventually Tunisia failed to materialise giving Mali their 1-0 win. The Zambian referee claimed to have heard from somebody that the match Sikazwe said: \"I reached the point where I could start hearing some noise and I thought someone was communicating with me and people were telling me 'no you ended the match'. It was a very strange situation. \"I was going through my head to find who told me to end the match. Maybe I was talking to myself, I don't know.

Waiting for over four hours for a room.\" And another fan, who travelled nearly 7,000 miles to be in Qatar from Canada, said the Free Zone Fan Village was a \"complete disaster\".  \"People had been waiting for over four hours and all the staff just disappeared saying most of the rooms aren't ready or people haven't previously checked out,\" he said.  He arrived at the fanzone at 10am, had his bags taken away, but then didn't getting a room until 4am.  And another punter complained of a leaking shower and toilet in his cabin, as well as overpriced food and terrible transport links to the stadiums. He urged all fans to use taxis. The tiny container-style cabins house two people in a cramped bedroom with an en suite shower - and the metal structures are left baking beneath the blazing sun. The sites have little shade - but do have food stalls, big screens to watch the games, and on-site supermarkets. Football fans also vented their frustration on social media, with one Saudi Arabian footie fan sharing videos of huge crowds gathered outside the village. Police were reportedly called to help keep order amongst the frustrated football fans.  He accused the authorities of \"overbooking\" the site - claiming many fans were left without any accomodation at all.  The dedicated \"World Cup Fans\" account posting a lengthy thread on the situation to its more than 4,000 followers. The account - which provides information on tickets and accomodation for fans - vented the situation at the two villages had \"turned the joy of fans into misery\".  \"Hundreds of fans from different countries of the world who have confirmed reservations in the fan villages suffered and are still suffering from mismanagement of the fan villages,\" it wrote. It went on: \"The majority of the rooms have been received and are in a dirty state in the full sense of the word and are not suitable for human habitation \"The majority of cabins have a problem with air conditioning, and there is no solution, and they have become more like sauna rooms, especially during the day.\" Qatar has already faced questions over organisation of the World Cup \u2013 with reports weeks before the start that the nation simply was not ready.

In a statement the Qatari Supreme Committee told The Sun Online: \"We are aware that a number of fans have faced delays checking into select Fan Village accommodation due to owner and operator negligence.\u00a0 \"A section of units in these facilities, which are delivered and managed by different private entities, have not met the required standards that were advertised to fans. \"While these sites are managed by independent commercial entities, rectifying these issues remains the utmost priority for the Supreme\u00a0Committee.\u00a0 \"Full refunds are being offered to fans severely impacted by this issue as well as alternative accommodation which will be free of charge for the duration of their stay.\"\u00a0\u00a0"},

John told talkSPORT: \"We met one of the sheikh's sons and he took us back to the palace and he showed us, he had lions and everything. \"They've made us so welcome and look around you, it doesn't get any better than this.\" But after many expressed scepticism at his claims, Alex shared a video appearing to back up his story.

{"title": "Inside Polish Ultras who host mass brawls & hack rivals to death with machetes ahead of Mexico clash at Qatar World Cup", "author": "Anthony Blair", "date": "22 Nov 2022", "content": "FROM organising bare-chested fights in the forests to rioting in the streets with knives and bats, Poland has some of the most notorious hooligan firms of any nations competing in the World Cup.  While hooliganism in the United Kingdom has largely been consigned to the dustbin of history, Polish Ultras firms have drawn comparisons with the bad old days of the 1980s in Britain. With their first   match today against Mexico,   authorities will be hoping the match passes off without any trouble off the pitch. Hooligan trouble is not expected during the game with many Ultras subject to bans - but the hoolies still carry a fearsome reputation.  Murders and brutal attacks have been associated with the firms - including one hooligan was stabbed 64 time with knives and machetes, and another who had his hand CHOPPED OFF.  Famous hoolie firms in   include Destroyers, Sharks, Terror Corps, Teddy Boys and Young Freaks '98.  Poland's most infamous ultras firms come from Krakow, where fans of rival teams Wisla and MKS Cracovia maintain an often-violent derby. Such is the level of hostility between the two sides, that the Krakow derby is referred to as the Holy War. Unlike the beery hooligan stereotype in England, Polish ultras often maintain a straight-edged lifestyle with no drinking or even smoking, claiming that it makes them \"weak\". In the runup to a match between England and Poland in 1999 in the Polish capital Warsaw, seven English fans were hospitalised after fierce clashes. At least two supporters were stabbed after thugs threw bottles, bricks, and metal poles at each other. The brawl in central Warsaw's Saski Park was reportedly prearranged, with one Polish hooligan claiming the clashes were set up by mobile phone. Two more England fans were taken to hospital following a separate incident where thugs hurled bricks and bottles at rival supporters near a pub in the Old Town. Running battles also took place inside the stadium itself, despite a heavy police presence. A Polish hooligan known as \"Jack\" said at the time: \"The Polish fans will do anything for a fight. They speak to each other on mobiles all the time. It's all pre-arranged. \"Supporters of Legia\u00a0Warsaw have been going around the last two nights looking for trouble.\" Krakow is by far the most notorious city for ultras in Poland, even earning the nickname City of Knives. This is because the Wisla and Cracovia firms are the only ones who didn't sign the so-called \"Poznan Agreement\". The peace treaty, signed by all other Polish firms nationwide, agrees that they won't use weapons during fights. In 2010, police in Lodz searched a train of Wisla supporters and recovered a terrifying haul of weapons. They included 25 machetes, a military bayonet, three axes, four knives, and two 70cm-long wooden handles. However, despite their fearsome reputation, Polish ultras can also have a softer side. Krzysztof, a hooligan supporter of Slask Wroclaw, met grandmother Mariola through a class, and even though she supported rival team Ruch Chorzow, the two fell in love. They made an unlikely couple. She was a grandma and ran her own business, he was a convicted hooligan who had served eight years in prison for robbery and football-related violence. Their romance was even the subject of an HBO documentary, \"Love Without Argument\", in 2012. But a devastated Mariola revealed last year that they had split up after her toyboy ultra lover cheated on her with an older woman. However, with a slightly more muted atmosphere than normal at the World Cup and a strong use of a football banning orders, no hooligan trouble is expected.  Qatar has drafted in an   made up of cops from around the world - including notorious French riot police and tough Turkish commandos.

But others have criticised the supporters for dressing as \"crusaders\" which could be considered offensive in the Middle East.   authorities confirmed to The Sun Online anything considered as \"weapons and body protection\" is banned when asked about the knightly costumes.

Helmets are also strictly banned from the stadiums, and weapons are defined as \"any object which could [...] endanger the safety of others\".

The two men - understood to be England fans - are speaking to group of four Qatari security officials. They appear to point the two men away from the turnstiles and send them on their way.  Other footage has also seen England fans dressed as knights getting into the swing of things in Qatar. Iman Atta, director of Tell Mama, a UK project monitoring Islamophobic hate, told The Telegraph: \u201cOur fans should be mindful that there are things that may cause offence to Qatari citizens, such as openly drinking or wearing historical Crusader Knights Templar outfits that have very negative implications in the region. \u201cWe also know that this is not done to purposefully irritate Qataris but out of a desire to support England. \u201cHowever, we firmly believe in the principle that any World Cup should have an environment where fans can be open, enjoy what they want to wear and feel safe and secure.  \"This principle is one that we believe in - though in Qatar, people should just be mindful and aware of deep sensitivities.\u201d Ashley Brown, head of supporter engagement at the Football Supporters Association, said he believed the supporters had simply been \"naive\".  \"I think it\u2019s naivety rather than anything intentional. They\u2019re dressing as St George, the patron saint, but perhaps they don\u2019t really understand the implication of what they\u2019re wearing,\" he explained.  Fan trouble has been limited at the Qatar World Cup - with most supporters at the games seeming to be in good spirits despite limited access to booze.

FIFA have reportedly spent the last three years testing its  And it has now been in use at the   on multiple occassions. But what is the semi-automatic offside tool? The semi-automatic offside tool is a piece of technology being introduced to make   decisions quicker and more accurate. It will be done by a system using computer tracker of 29 body parts of each player, combined with a microchip inside the ball. This is expected to determine the positions of the players at the exact moment the ball has been played. So in the case of an offside situation, the video operations room will receive an automated alert alongside an automatic selected point and an instant drawn lines within seconds of the incident. Match officials will then have to validate the proposed selected kick point and the drawn offside line before VAR communicates the final decision on the pitch. Extra VAR officials will be in charge of calling offsides with the algorithm providing a 3D animation to explain a call in a average of 25 seconds. And that illustration is then available on the giant screens within the stadium and for TV viewers to take a look at in the next stoppage of play.

Iran's state run media also attacked the team after their 6-2 thumping by England - but made no mention of them snubbing the national anthem.  One should not be surprised of any retaliatory action by this regime Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's favourite newspaper Kayhan vented fury - blaming the team's defeat on a \"unprecedented psychological media war\". The newspaper also raged at Iranian fans in the stadium who cheered the team's defeat at the hands of the Three Lions. \"This campaign did not spare any effort to create a gap between the people of Iran and the members of the Iranian national football team, as well as producing false dichotomies,\" it said. \"This political-media movement, mainly Londoners, with the support and coordination of local patriots, from movie and sports celebrities to chain media and Telegram channels, and even reformist political figures, have joined hands to attack the players\" And even as the game kicked off on Monday, protesters continued to take to the streets in Iran - with reports police opened fire with live rounds on a one demonstration.  Another hardline newspaper Vatanemrooz fumed that protesters celebrated the Iranian team's defeat to England.  Footage shared only shows people cheering and drivers honking their horns as the Three Lions scored against Iran.  Alicia Kearns MP, chairs the UK's Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, vowed the UK would support the players if they sought asylum in the UK. She said there was a \"serious and severe\" risk to their lives after they refused to sing the anthem - hailing it as a \"very bold and brave political statement\".  Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for opposition group in exile the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, told The Sun Online: \"One should not be surprised of any retaliatory action by this regime.\" He added: \"At least 600 protesters, [including] at least 60 juveniles, have been killed and 30,000 detained by the regime. \"There has been a massive nationwide opposition and enmity toward the ruling theocracy, and all of the mullahs\u2019 ruthless crackdown has failed to stymie the growing uprising.\" Political dissent is a   - and is one of the offences subject to capital punishment, with 21 protesters already facing execution after sham trials since the start of the uprising in September. Iranian officials had already been discussing cracking down on perceived disrespect to their national anthem and flag ahead of the World Cup. Massoud Setayeshi, spokesman for the Iran's Judiciary, said just days ago that punishments could be meted out for those who reject the anthem. Iranian courts have been taking a brutal line on people linked to the protests, with more than 15,000 people arrested and hundreds killed by the security forces. And just last month, teenager Asra Panahi was beaten to death after she reportedly refused to sing a pro-government anthem. State news agencies also reported just ten days ago an Iranian cleric during prayers called on athletes who disrespect the anthem to face punishment. Iran's current president is Ebrahim Raisi - who is known as \"The Butcher\" for his role in the massacre of thousands of protesters in 1988. However, Iran has shown restraint in recent months - opting not punish climber Elnaz Rekabi\u00a0who competed without the nation's mandatory hijab. And the Iranian men's water polo team - who also refused to sing the anthem - have also so-far gone unpunished. \u00a0of the ruling regime have gripped Iran since the death  She was arrested and allegedly beaten to death for flouting the strict Islamic dress code. Dozens of Iranian public figures, athletes and artists have displayed solidarity with the protesters. But there was anger as the national team remained in a state of silence. The players however turned this silence into a gesture ahead of their game with England as they refused to sing the national anthem. Iranian state television did not show the players lined up for the anthem before the match got underway just across the Gulf. The Iranian squad could not avoid being overshadowed by the anti-government unrest that has rattled the regime. Ahead of the match, no Iranian player had voiced support for the demonstrations by compatriots from all walks of life. It is one of the most sustained challenges to the cleric elite since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Before travelling to Doha the team met with hardline Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Photos of the players with Raisi, one of them bowing in front of him, went viral while the street unrest raged on, drawing an outcry on social media. Some Iranian fans who went to Qatar for the World Cup made no secret of their solidarity with the unrest. They carried banners that read \"Women, Life, Freedom\" in support of the protests. \"Freedom for Iran. Stop killing children in the streets!\" shouted one Iranian woman. Another Iranian woman with the colours of an Iranian flag painted on her face said Iran is a football-crazed nation. \"But this year,\" she said, \"everything is different, all we care about is this revolution and for people to get their freedom back, and not be scared to just walk on the street, do and dress as they want, and say what they want.\" In the capital Tehran, some banners of the national team have been burned by angry protesters. Pictures of children killed in the protests were widely shared by Iranians on Twitter, with messages such as: \"They loved football too, but they were killed by the Islamic Republic.\" \"Those children took risks for their country and were killed by the regime. The national team should take risks and show solidarity with the nation,\" said Iran fan Hamidreza, 19. The Sun Online also spoke to an Iranian football legend who vowed before the game he would be\u00a0 ."},

They just had too much and were able to take the game away from Qatar. Qatar 1-3 Senegal 84. The ball is cut back to the penalty spot, finding Dieng. He turns and shoots in one movement, beating Barsham. That is the game for the Lions of Teranga now. Goal - Bamba Dieng (Senegal) Qatar 1-2 Senegal 82.

They need to show more urgency in their play, like it isn't an exhibition match. Qatar 0-2 Senegal 58. Hoping for Qatar to get two quick goals to make a game out of this may be too much to ask.

And here, SunSport takes a closer look at the latest betting odds, tips, predictions, bonuses and special offers. The opening fixture between Qatar and Ecuador took place at Al Bayt Stadium on Sunday. There will be three fixtures each day for the first 12 days of the competition -- all taking place at 1pm, 4pm and 7pm UK time. The final group matches will be played simultaneously at 3pm and 7pm. It's the first time that the tournament has been held in the Middle East, and domestic leagues will have to pause to allow it to be played in cooler temperatures. The last Premier League fixture were played on November 13, giving England's players just eight days to prepare for their opener against Iran. It was a similar story in Spain, Germany, Italy and France. The knockout stages begin on Saturday December 3, with the final due to take place at the Lusail Stadium in Doha on December 18. Betfair odds Five-time winners Brazil are currently favourites at 4/1. The South American heavyweights haven't tasted World Cup glory since 2002 but boast a stacked squad that features Neymar, Vinicius Junior, Alisson and Richarlison. Holders France are well fancied at 11/2 and have the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba at their disposal to become only the third side in history to defend their crown. Lionel Messi's Argentina are further behind at 13/2, just ahead of Spain at 15/2. England, who are also 15/2, have been inching closer to international success having reach the semi-finals in Russia before losing to Italy on penalties at Euro 2020. 2014 champions Germany are available at 9/1, ahead of the Netherlands (13/1) and Belgium and Portugal (16/1).  -  Sky Bet odds England talisman Harry Kane leads the way in the battle for the coveted Golden Boot at odds of 7/1 with Sky Bet. Kane, 28, won the award at the 2018 World Cup after netting six, and could fill his boots in the group stages against Iran and the USA. Superstar Kylian Mbappe is next at 8/1 after scoring 39 goals in 46 appearances for PSG last season, while he's already notched 17 times this term. He also boasts 28 goals in 59 games for France, and could do damage against Tunisia, Denmark and Australia in Group D. It's no surprise to see Mbappe's compatriot and Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema next at 12/1, along with global superstar Lionel Messi. Ronaldo finished as the top scorer at the European Championship with five goals -- that's despite Portugal's elimination in the Round of 16. He's offered at 16/1, along with Romelu Lukaku and Neymar.   New customers only. First single & e/w bet only. \u00a310 minimum stake. Odds of 1/1 or greater. 4 x \u00a310 bet token.

A tournament-high 88,013 were said to have attended   on Thursday night. That was on a day when a total of 98,000 passed through the doors of the main Fan Fest in the centre of Doha. The official attendance figures have surprised many observers who have noted the proliferation of empty seats at a majority of matches so far. Some of the no-shows have been the result of late entrants caused by delays outside the grounds but banks of empty seats make the latest Fifa numbers surprising. Despite that, Fifa said the tournament was proving a huge success, especially the Fan Fest. Fifa said: \u201cThe multi-national and multi-cultured festival of football is screening every FIFA   game on giant screens. \u201cIt is also providing free entertainment between games with some of the most famous names from music scenes around the world \u2013 and has been enjoyed by fans from every corner of the globe.\u00a0 \u201cAlthough currently most games show low or no availability of tickets, fans are reminded to check  on a regular basis as additional ticket batches may be released and the resale platform is open.\u201d\u00a0"},
{"title": "Inside insane Qatar waterpark with world\u2019s TALLEST slide as big as Big Ben as workers rush to finish it for World Cup", "author": "Henry Holloway", "date": "22 Nov 2022", "content": "QATAR is rushing to finish one of the world's most insane water parks before the end of the World Cup. Billions of pounds have been spent building the   from the ground up - but not everything has been ready on time.  And one of the features still being frantically developed is the incredible Meryal Waterpark\u00a0on Qetaifan Island North. The island is part of the man made archipelago\u00a0and is meant to be one of the city's entertainment hubs.  And its centrepiece is a stagger 260feet tall tower called \"The Icon\" which is nearly as towering as Big Ben at 316feet.  With crisscrossing tubes and slides, the enormous structure is boasted to contain the world's tallest waterslide.  The tower contains 12 rides with two on each of the tower's six levels - and park goers will need to use elevators to get to the top.  It is being developed by Canadian based slide company WhiteWater West.  \"In addition to breaking a world record for the tallest water slide, the Icon Tower will also feature the most water slides on a single tower,\" the firm said.  Pictures show the Icon Tower on another small man-made island away from the main body of the water park.   news outlets boasted the island complex would welcome up to 50,000 visitors daily during the  . The complex is only 3 miles away from the Lusail Stadium and was being advertised as a \"must go\" for footie fans. Meryal Waterpark - which has a total of 36 rides - was boasted to open its doors to visitors during November and December. But it appears to remain under construction despite the arrival of fans for World Cup. Workers will now be rushing to try to complete the facility in time - with the final now just weeks away on December 18. Meryal Waterpark's official social media pages still lists the site as \"coming soon\".  Pictures and videos shared online in the last week show The Icon Tower remains surrounded by scaffolding and cranes.  Other images show workmen still on site - and huge areas of the park still needing completion.  It is unclear if the megastructure and the surrounding theme park will be welcoming the one million fans in Qatar for the World Cup.  Lusail city is the second largest city in the Gulf State with a population of around 200,000 people. It has seen more than \u00a340billion plowed in to transform the coastal city as part of Qatar National Vision 2030.  The project has seen the 14-square mile patch of land converted into what the Qataris hope will be a paradise on the Gulf. The city hosted its first game of the World Cup today as Argentina were stunned 2-1 by Saudi Arabia. And the massive new stadium will also host the final.  But behind all the glitzy buildings and high-tech systems however there are fears the city - like many infrastructure projects in Qatar - harbours a dark secret. It is feared such rapid developments have been built on the suffering of thousands of migrant workers - something Qatar denies. Human rights groups estimate more than 6,500 workers have died in Qatar since they won the right to stage the World Cup. Qatar has a two million strong migrant workforce - with many of them said to work for low pay in sweltering conditions. Doha denies mistreatment of migrant workers and says it is proactively working to improve standards. Once completed, it is hoped Lusail will have a theme park, a lagoon, two marinas, two golf courses, 22 hotels along with luxury shopping and commercial districts. Sprawling around the the West Bay Lagoon, the city is 14 miles north of Doha and is hoped to one day have infrastructure to support 450,000 people. Incredible earthworks have seen four man made islands spring up the city which was essentially built from scratch. The\u00a0Lusail Iconic Stadium has capacity for 80,000 people. And the city hosted Qatar's first Formula 1 race last year when Lewis Hamilton won the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But one of the most recognisable parts of the city is the crescent moon hotel complex, the Katara Towers. It is 692ft tall with 40 floors - housing two luxury hotels along with apartments, offices and shops. Qatar has already faced questions over organisation of the World Cup - with reports weeks before the start that the nation simply was not ready. Confusion over the\u00a0 , infrastructure problems and reports of\u00a0 \u00a0have already surfaced. The tiny country is expected to welcome more than one million fans during the tournament - when the country only has a population of 2.9million. Billions have been spent to try and ready the nation for its first attempt at holding an event of this scale."},

Serbian and Brazilian fans were pictured brawling in the stands in Russia in 2018 - and   organisers will be keen to avoid any such scenes.  Hooligan firms in the Balkan state have chilling names such as The Gravediggers,  Head Hunters, Zulu Warriors, and the Red Devils. And one of their most vicious leaders is known as: \"Ivan the Terrible\".  Tracing their lineage back to the Balkan war of the 1990s, Serb football hooligans are renowned for the tough-as-nails attitude and love of violence. In the past, the Ultras have killed rival fans - including a Toulouse supporter in 2009 who was beaten to death with iron bars and bicycle chains.  And with fears of repeat of the 2018 carnage against Brazil, Serbia also face bitter rivals Switzerland next week which could also fuel the possibility of violence. Qatar however is taking no chances with disorder - drafting a multinational policing team to try and control the fans.  Belgrade football authorities have been keen to crack down on violence - but high profile domestic games still can be marred by violence.  Serbian hooligan firms are linked heavily to far-right politics, Neo-Nazi sympathies, and organised crime.  Cops raided football fan groups linked to clubs Partizan and Red Star - arresting 17 people linked to drugs, murder and other \"monstrous crimes\" in February 2021.  And while the crackdown continues - with Serbian football keen to jettison the unwanted reputation - insiders have warned the firms still wield \"terrible power\" in the state.  In 2012, Ivan Bagdanov - a firebrand hooligan leader with links to Serbian far-right paramilitaries - forced a Euros qualifying match between   and   in Genoa to be abandoned after trying to attack rival fans and police. \"Ivan the Terrible\" Bagdanov rallied supporters to lob live flares and bangers onto the pitch as players warmed up and ordered them to break down barriers separating them from Italian fans while taunting police.

Kosovo fought Serbia in a bitter war for independence in 1999 that resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and soldiers on both sides. In 2014, a mass brawl broke out between fans at a Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania. Fans stormed the Partizan stadium in Belgrade and attacked players before riot police were called into to break up the bloody fight, forcing the match to be abandoned. Bagdanov's supporters may be joined by their bitter rivals known as \"The Gravediggers\" in Serbian. Supporters are known to plan their violent parades days before a match and have repeatedly said they would die for their club, according to  . Some have their own keys to local stadiums and describe themselves as \"knights\" of \"principles and honour\". \"We are black sheep of the society. Real rebellious...

Fears were already swirling that the team could face prison or even death - with calls for them to be  .  And in the strongest suggestion yet that the team could face reprisals at home, former Iranian intelligence chief turned and senior politician Mehdi Chamran warned of punishment for the team.  Chamran - a conservative hardliner who is now the head of the Tehran city council - said: \"We will never allow anyone to insult our anthem and flag.  \"Iranian civilisation has a history of several thousand years, this civilisation is as old as the total of European and American civilisations.\u201d Other top Iranian politicians also called for the team to be totally replaced by new players who are \"willing to sing the national anthem\", reports  .  Iran's state run media also attacked the team - but made no mention of them snubbing the national anthem.  Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's favourite newspaper Kayhan vented fury - blaming the team's defeat on a \"unprecedented psychological media war\". The newspaper also raged at Iranian fans in the stadium who cheered the team's defeat at the hands of the Three Lions. \"This campaign did not spare any effort to create a gap between the people of Iran and the members of the Iranian national football team, as well as producing false dichotomies,\" it said. \"This political-media movement, mainly Londoners, with the support and coordination of local patriots, from movie and sports celebrities to chain media and Telegram channels, and even reformist political figures, have joined hands to attack the players\" And even as the game kicked off on Monday, protesters continued to take to the streets in Iran - with reports police opened fire with live rounds on a one demonstration.  Another hardline newspaper Vatanemrooz fumed that protesters celebrated the Iranian team's defeat to England.  Footage shared only shows people cheering and drivers honking their horns as the English side thumped home six goals in a landmark win.  Alicia Kearns MP, chairs the UK's Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, vowed the UK would support the players if they sought asylum in the UK.

Political dissent is a   - and is one of the offences subject to capital punishment, with 21 protesters already facing execution after sham trials since the start of the uprising in September. Iranian officials had already been discussing cracking down on perceived disrespect to their national anthem and flag ahead of the World Cup. And the national team's defiance on such an international scale will spark fury amongst the regime - and could spark retribution. Massoud Setayeshi, spokesman for the Iran's Judiciary, said just days ago that punishments could be meted out for those who reject the anthem. Iranian courts have been taking a brutal line on people linked to the protests, with more than 15,000 people arrested and hundreds killed by the security forces. And just last month, teenager Asra Panahi was beaten to death after she reportedly refused to sing a pro-government anthem. State news agencies also reported just ten days ago an Iranian cleric during prayers called on athletes who disrespect the anthem to face punishment. Iran's current president is Ebrahim Raisi - who is known as \"The Butcher\" for his role in the massacre of thousands of protesters in 1988. However, Iran has shown restraint in recent months - opting not punish climber Elnaz Rekabi\u00a0who competed without the nation's mandatory hijab. And the Iranian men's water polo team - who also refused to sing the anthem - have also so-far gone unpunished. \u00a0of the ruling regime have gripped Iran since the death two months ago of young woman\u00a0 . She was arrested and allegedly beaten to death for flouting the strict Islamic dress code. Dozens of Iranian public figures, athletes and artists have displayed solidarity with the protesters. But there was anger as the national team remained in a state of silence. The players however turned this silence into a gesture ahead of their game with England as they refused to sing the national anthem. Iranian state television did not show the players lined up for the anthem before the match got underway just across the Gulf. The Iranian squad could not avoid being overshadowed by the anti-government unrest that has rattled the regime. Ahead of the match, no Iranian player had voiced support for the demonstrations by compatriots from all walks of life. It is one of the most sustained challenges to the cleric elite since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Before travelling to Doha the team met with hardline Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Photos of the players with Raisi, one of them bowing in front of him, went viral while the street unrest raged on, drawing an outcry on social media. Some Iranian fans who went to Qatar for the World Cup made no secret of their solidarity with the unrest. They carried banners that read \"Women, Life, Freedom\" in support of the protests. \"Freedom for Iran. Stop killing children in the streets!\" shouted one Iranian woman. Another Iranian woman with the colours of an Iranian flag painted on her face said Iran is a football-crazed nation. \"But this year,\" she said, \"everything is different, all we care about is this revolution and for people to get their freedom back, and not be scared to just walk on the street, do and dress as they want, and say what they want.\" In the capital Tehran, some banners of the national team have been burned by angry protesters. Pictures of children killed in the protests were widely shared by Iranians on Twitter, with messages such as: \"They loved football too, but they were killed by the Islamic Republic.\" \"Those children took risks for their country and were killed by the regime.

He had fire in his belly, hunger. \"It went from wanting to give up on him in those first few years to when it started to happen after the 2006 World Cup. \"When you look at the season it was when all the negative aspects of his game just disappeared. \"When a player starts getting 30 goals and 15 or 20 assists you can put up with anything from them. \"It was match after match after match and in a two-year period I've never seen anything like it on a pitch at Old Trafford. \"It's very rare you can say you've had the best player in the world bar none and I think we did that season. \"Sir Alex [Ferguson] and Carlos Queiroz both championed him and believed in him. \"He came back from the 2006 World Cup and his maturity had changed. His appearance and physical attributes completely changed overnight. \"He was scrawny, wiry and not very strong and then all of a sudden he was a supper middleweight boxer. \"He was incredible from a strength point of view and the ability to leap, change direction, everything fell into place. \"From that moment on you knew he was going to be really special.\" Neville went on to reveal the quest for personal accolades spurred Ronaldo on to be the best he could be, adding: \"He was incredibly driven. \"I knew him more professionally than personally but his drive was out of this world. \"He was one of the few players that would announce that individual trophies were important to him. \"Most would say the team is more important but he would say, 'I want to be the best player in the world because in turn it would help my team'. \"He wanted to be the very, very best in the world and what he's done over many years is exceptional. \"It's an obsession with scoring goals, applying himself every day, being the fittest he could be. \"He's lifted his standards every year. He wants to be the greatest of all time and understanding along the way that the teams he plays in will be successful.\" Ronaldo is world-famous for his work-ethic, regularly sharing his   on social media.

No reason for fun and frolics on this occasion and Ecuador will feel justice has been done in earning a share of the spoils. Boos had rung out at the Khalifa at half time. It was in the final minute of the first period when a poor corner to the near post was cleared to the edge of the area from where Angelo Reciado shot and Pervis Estupinan stuck out a boot to deflect the ball past goalkeeper Andries Noppert. Celebrations round the ground where Ecuador fans outnumbered the Dutch by four to one. But the linesman's flag was raised against Jackson Porozo who was standing in the six-yard box. He didn\u2019t touch the ball but was adjudged to have affected the goalkeeper's view even though Noppert was already diving to his right before Estupinan\u2019s intervention. No Dutch players appealed, not even Noppert who looked as confused as the Ecuador players when the flag was raised.

Worryingly for Ecuador, however, Valencia would later leave the field on a stretcher before limping heavily to the dugout. What a goal it was that had given Holland the early lead. Brighton\u2019s Moises Caicedo was guilty of losing possession to Davy Klaassen and what he did next was class.

The 2018 campaign in Russia ended in a miserable group stage exit, so   side will be desperate to right their wrongs from four years ago.  Although expectation is not particularly high for the 2014 champions, who have reached at least the semis in four of the last five tournaments. Japan on the other hand reached the Round of 16 in Russia, and   will be desperate not to avoid a slip up, especially with    also in the group. The Samurai Blue are skippered by former Southampton star Maya Yoshida, with   ace Takehiro Tomiyasu providing more defensive solidity.  Here, SunSport previews the Group E clash as Germany look to avoid a repeat of their disastrous 2018 campaign. The 2014 champions breezed through qualifying, winning nine out of their 10 games en route to Qatar. Their only loss was a shock 2-1 defeat at home to North Macedonia.  But their qualifying campaign did include a 6-0 win against Armenia and a 9-0 victory over Liechtenstein. The Samurai Blue finished second in their group during the third round of Asian qualifiers to seal their spot in tournament. They qualified automatically, behind Saudi Arabia, winning seven out of their 10 games.  The Germans aren't on the best of runs going into the tournament, winning just two out of their last eight games. That includes two draws against  , and a shock home defeat to Hungary in September.  The four-time winners edged past Oman 1-0 in a friendly last week in far from convincing fashion. The Samurai Blue lost a friendly against Canada last week after conceding in the 95th minute.

The ex-Arsenal winger has scored 10 goals and provided 10 assists in 23 games in all competitions since the summer. His form in recent months has seen him linked with a return to the Gunners. KYOGO FURUHASHI is likely to start up front for Japan, and he could pose some problems for the Germans. The 27-year-old has been a revelation since joining Celtic in the summer of 2021.

Laporte was born in the French Basque Country so is French by nationality.

Laporte, however, played 51 times for France's youth sides, from Under-17s all the way up to the Under-21s, who he captained.

Laporte was actually called up to the France squad in September 2019, however he got damaged his knee ligaments before he could play.  reports that boss Didier Deschamps promised a return to the French squad as soon as he was fit but the call never came, a decision which ultimately set in motion Laporte's switch to Spain.

But ever since that one was done and dusted, I\u2019ve been able to focus my fury \u00adexclusively on Qatar. And I\u2019m not the only one. Just about everyone else has weighed in, with good reason, on more or less every single aspect of it. The human rights record of the Qatari regime; the carbon footprint; the \u00adtiming\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009you name it. Fifa has been good enough to give us plenty to go on. More came thick and fast this week as the hordes of journalists arrived in Doha and started whingeing about the pricey pints and  To be fair, if I was lucky enough to be there, I\u2019d \u00adprobably have the nerve to be having a whinge of my own. But really, what else was anybody expecting in a dry state in the Middle East?. Even some fans lucky enough to be there were at it. Some old boy was on the radio saying how he was being forced to fly in to watch every Wales match from nearby Dubai. Cue an orchestra of tiny violins. I think we call these gripes First World problems nowadays. Because the truth of the \u00admatter is \u2014 as ever \u2014 that the vast majority of fans won\u2019t be at the World Cup. They\u2019ll be where they \u00adusually are every four years. They\u2019ll be somewhere far more familiar, where it costs much less for a bevvy and you can drink it pretty much whenever you like. They call it home\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009or the pub. It\u2019s time to blow the whistle on the Qatar complaints. Enough now. It\u2019s happening. Let\u2019s hold our noses and enjoy the party. This is what I\u2019ve resolved to do, having frightened myself working out that I\u2019ll probably only experience another six World Cups in my lifetime. And I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to let  or anyone else ruin any one of them for me. If I make it to 80, my last major tournament will be the 2046 World Cup, held God knows where. Mars, probably. I\u2019ll be making the trip, no matter what the political \u00adsituation is there. I feel sorry for the players. Extravagantly paid they might be, living lives of great luxury, but time stops for no man and they\u2019ll be lucky to have the chance of playing in any more than three World Cups. If we\u2019re not careful we\u2019ll have them feeling like soldiers sent off to fight in an \u00adunpopular war, unheralded and uncelebrated. They deserve better from us. None of this is their fault. And yet they are now the only ones who can change everything about our attitude to this World Cup. As the old saying goes, when your team\u2019s winning matches, even the pies taste good. Yes, they can turn it all round for us, and we\u2019ve got to start getting right behind them to help them do it. A good start for our boys, followed by progress in the knockout stages accompanied perhaps by a few late dramas,, and nigh-on 12 solid years of moaning will all be forgotten. When it does, you can bet everyone over there will stop their whining.  They\u2019ll be popping corks on million pound bottles of \u00adchampagne. Maybe. My mind goes back to \u00adsomething   said to me at the World Cup of 2014.  We were broadcasting from Copacabana Beach. The story of the day had been  trying to make a snack out of Italy\u2019s  One player actually biting another? \u00adDisgraceful! The Uruguayan was in a world of trouble. A lifetime ban was even mooted. I suggested to Gordon that Suarez might never play again. \u201cOf course he will,\u201d laughed Gordon. \u201cBecause there is no morality in football.\u201d He was right. It\u2019s the worst thing about the game, but also the best. Yes, terrible transgressions of decent, human behaviour may be forgiven or overlooked, because brilliant football trumps everything. The Suarez-Chiellini chompfest is a case in point. Chiellini himself wrote in his memoir that not only did he forgive Suarez the bite, he actually admired him for it. Football will always win out. It\u2019s bigger than all of us, as we\u2019ll see in the coming weeks.  It\u2019s bigger than Fifa or Qatar or Russia or whichever referee or players offend our sensibilities this time round. Once it gets going, I believe we\u2019ll all get going. And once England get going, the sky will be the limit. Qatar \u2014 quite unjustly \u2014 will feel like the most normal place on Earth, and back home it\u2019ll be like winter isn\u2019t happening. But we, the fans at home, need to do our bit to get  out of the starting blocks.  Ahead of the women\u2019s Euros this summer I had a hunch our team was going to do something special. For once \u2014 and I mean once \u2014 in my football life, I was right. (I had to be right sooner or later. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.) Almost out of superstition, I hereby repeat the words  before that tournament started. I said that it was important to get behind them from the beginning, because it would be no good jumping on the bandwagon when they got to the final and won it. So, in the spirit of that, I pray to you, myself and all other interested parties: Let the moaning stop and the cheering commence as a \u00adjoyous English march to the final begins. Bring it on."},

Ortega made his debut in Peru's highest tier at the age of just 23. The game between Union Comercio and Alianza Atletico finished 5-2 with Ortega reaching for his pocket twice during the 90 minutes. The 30-year-old entered the international stage in 2019, taking charge of an under-17 match between   and  . He was later summoned to his first senior match, officiating a friendly between Ecuador and Trinidad and Tobago. Ortega was at the centre of attention after awarding   a controversial penalty against Bolivian side, Club Always Ready. This led to a police search of the referee's booth, where Boca Juniors shirts were discovered. Whilst CAR accused Ortega of biased refereeing, Boca Juniors assured the gifts were usual practice. Ortega could become the second-youngest referee to officiate a World Cup final after Ivan Eklind, who was given the role in 1934, just a year younger than Ortega.

Infantino started by claiming: \u201cToday I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker. \u201cOf course I am not Qatari, Arab, gay or disabled. \u201cBut I was the son of a migrant worker, saw their conditions. Not in Qatar, but Switzerland. \u201cAs a child I was bullied because I had red hair and freckles. Plus I was Italian and didn\u2019t speak German. \u201cWhat do you do? You look down, go to your room and cry and then you try to make some friends, to speak and engage and get these friends to engage with others.\u201d Infantino went on: \u201cThis criticism is profoundly unjust. \u201cYou don\u2019t start accusing, fighting, insulting. You start engaging. \u201cWe have heard many moral lessons from Europe and the western world. \u201cBut for what we Europeans have done over the past 3,000 years we should apologise for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons here. \u201cReform and change takes time. It took hundred of years in Europe. \u201cThe only way to compare results is by engaging and dialogue, not by hammering and insults.\u201d Fifa was forced into an embarrassing U-turn when the s  in any of the eight   stadiums. That raised questions over whether the promises made by the Qatari authorities over the treatment of gay fans were trustworthy. Infantino said: \u201cI can confirm that everyone is welcome. I have had this conversation several times. \u201cAnyone who says the opposite, it is not the opinion of the country or of  . \u201cEveryone who comes to Qatar must be welcome and is welcome. Whatever religion, race, sexual orientaton. \u201cThat is our requirement and the Qatari state will stick to that. \u201cYou will tell me there is legislation here, you can go to jail for being gay. \u201cBut that legislation exists in many countries. It was there in Switzerland in 1954 when they organised the World Cup. \u201cYes, you can say that it is bad that it is not allowed to be publicly gay. Of course I believe it should be allowed but I went through a process. \u201cWe have to welcome everybody. It is right that football brings people together. \u201cBut how many gay people were prosecuted in the past in Europe? We seem to forget that WE went through a process.\u201d Infantino claimed that Fifa\u2019s pressure on the Qataris had been responsible for significant changes in working conditions for the hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers in the country, including meeting some of the demands from European nations. He added: \u201cSince 2014, 25,000 migrants have died trying to get into Europe. \u201cThe last Canton in Switzerland only gave the vote to women in the 1990s, and that needed the Supreme Court to make it happens. This was the mentality in Europe just a few years ago. \u201cSo all I am asking is engage, help, don\u2019t divide. The world is divided enough. \u201cI have read things this week that some fans shouldn\u2019t cheer for   because they look Indian. \u201cThis is racism. This is pure racism. Everyone in the world has the right to cheer for who they want. \u201cThey have different lives. You want to have a moment where you can concentrate on football, something we love. The problems don\u2019t go away but you can have a moment. \u201cSo criticise Fifa and me but let the people enjoy this World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s once every four years. Don\u2019t criticise the country. Do we want to continue to spit on the Arabs just because they look different?\u201d Infantino was sitting head to Fifa\u2019s head of communications and former Sky Sports Chief Reporter Bryan Swanson, who intervened at the end of the conference to announce: \u201cI\u2019m sitting here as a gay man in Qatar. \u201cWe have received assurances that everyone is welcome and I believe everybody will be welcome. \u201cJust because Gianni Infantino is not gay doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t care. He does care. When he says we are inclusive, he means it.\u201d"},

A few notable absentees will be missed - including the likes of  ,  , Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Martin Odegaard and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But the vast majority of the world's best will be in the Middle East for the tournament - which is taking place at the end of the year for the first time since it began. And SunSport has taken the time to look at which players are the best-paid heading into the  . Five of the 11 players which make up the \"best-paid XI\" ply their trade in the  . France are the most represented country with three names in there, while   has just one representative. Manuel Neuer is not actually the best paid goalkeeper out there - that goes to Manchester United's David De Gea. But he was snubbed by Spain and left at home to play with his \u00a3375,000 per week. So instead, German legend Neuer, on \u00a3298,000-a-week, is the best paid stopper in Qatar. Liverpool right-back Alexander-Arnold, 24, wasn't even a certain pick by Gareth Southgate. His form for the Reds, certainly from a defensive point of view, has been highly questioned this season. But he's loved at Anfield and that's why he's paid a whopping \u00a3180,000-a-week. It makes him the highest-paid right-back going to the World Cup - narrowly ahead of Morocco and PSG man Achraf Hakimi. The first of three Manchester United stars in this team. , 29, was handed a \u00a3340,000-a-week deal when he made the switch from the Bernabeu to Old Trafford last year. And he will be hoping he can help France retain the World Cup in Qatar, a tournament he proved instrumental in helping them win four years ago. Matthijs de Ligt joins Varane at centre-back. That's partly thanks to the absence of the better paid Sergio Ramos - who was overlooked by Spain - and David Alaba whose nation Austria failed to qualify. Dutchman De Ligt swapped Juventus for Bayern Munich in the summer and picks up \u00a3265,000-a-week for the German giants.  Perhaps a surprise inclusion for many,   joins De Ligt as the only Bundesliga stars to make this team. The French defender, 26, can play both centre-back and left-back and has done for several years for Bayern Munich. His lucrative deal sees him earn \u00a3240,000 each week. Yet another Manchester United man and a window into just how much the Red Devils are paying their players during this turbulent spell at the club. Brazilian star  , 30, joined from Real Madrid and managed to secure a \u00a3350,000-a-week pay packet. The World Cup is the one trophy missing from the midfielder's glittering mantlepiece - which includes five Champions League winners medals. Manchester City's only member of this team is their midfield maestro  . The 31-year-old Belgian is on \u00a3400,000-a-week at the Etihad, making him their best-paid player - even with the addition of Erling Haaland. 's \u00a3750,000-a-week wages are enough to see him secure a place in this team. The Argentine, 35, may still be searching for his first World Cup but he is perhaps the greatest player to ever grace the game - so it's no surprise PSG are paying him that sort of figure. Brazilian talisman  , 30, will be hoping to lead his country to a first World Cup in two decades later this year. The PSG man earns \u00a3600,000-a-week in the French capital, but that pales in comparison to the main man in Paris... The deal   agreed with PSG earlier this year makes him the best-paid player in the world by some distance. It is a ludicrous two-year contract with the option of an additional year should the Frenchman take it up. It currently sees Mbappe, 23, earn around \u00a31.6MILLION per WEEK. The fourth and final Manchester United man and the striker of this best-paid XI. , 37, is now predominantly an impact substitute at Old Trafford following the arrival of Erik ten Hag. But that doesn't stop Portugal's Euro 2016 winner from raking in \u00a3500,000 every week."},

And, yes, we\u2019ve already identified Piggy.

Welcome to  , the beautiful desert land of sun, sand and concrete. With all the matches being staged within spitting distance of each other, for the first ever  , all of Fleet Street\u2019s finest sportswriters (plus a few of us pretenders) appear to be staying in the same apartment block in the appropriately named Al Sadd district of Doha. It\u2019s a weird social experiment to\u00a0discover how many planet-sized egos can be crammed into the most soulless space imaginable before it all kicks off. And the way things are going I wouldn\u2019t bet on everyone making \u00a0it safely home at the end of the \u00a0tournament. We\u2019ve already seen one   for having the temerity to film a roundabout near a department store. But there are so many rules and protocols to follow out here that you risk the wrath of the authorities every time you step on to the streets. No booze, no vapes, no sausages, no porn, no painkillers, no gays, no swearing, no public displays of affection. Even previous World Cup hosts Russia were easy going compared to this lot. It\u2019s not that the reception we have received has been hostile or unwelcoming. Far from it in fact. But they are so used to following the strict letter of the law that they simply can\u2019t countenance the idea of compromise. Having said all that, I think I am still \u00a0waiting to meet my first Qatari national, because 90 per cent of the population are migrant workers and they are the ones doing all the heavy lifting. Some of them live here permanently and others are just here to help with the smooth running of this tournament. The first person I met on arrival at Doha International Airport was the world\u2019s happiest taxi driver, a Kenyan called Joseph. He couldn\u2019t wait to tell us how he\u2019d had \u2018that Gareth Southgate\u2019 in the back of his cab and that the England boss had arranged five World Cup tickets for him.

But if you\u2019re looking for an actual example of World Cup fever, then you are going to be sorely disappointed. Maybe that will change when all the travelling supporters arrive in the next 48 hours. But it still won\u2019t disguise the fact that the Qataris themselves are not that interested in football. This is simply an opportunity for them to showcase their country\u2019s wealth and their ability to build seven new stadiums and an entire metro system. It\u2019s a joyless marketing operation aimed at catching the eye of corporate investors in the willy-waving battle with their rival Arabian states. Which once again begs the question as to what exactly are we all doing here? Because if you thought that it was a terrible idea when Fifa awarded the World Cup to Qatar in 2010, it is only when you actually get here that the true depth of the corruption behind that decision really hits home.

But that will NOT apply to the official hospitality areas, where tickets cost four-figure sums and each box suite has sold for around \u00a320,000. Those seats and packages have promised \u201ca selection of drinks available according to custom and preference; soft drinks, beers, Champagne, sommelier-selected wines, and premium spirits\u201d available \u201cbefore, during and after matches\u201d. That will not be an option for the thousands of fans who have bought normal stadium tickets and represents a huge change that will put Fifa under massive pressure to justify itself. It is understood that Qatar\u2019s ruling Royal Family has demanded the U-turn, with growing resentment against attempts to force through a more cosmopolitan approach to the tournament. Earlier this week, the Qataris ordered Fifa to move some Budweiser concession stands that were deemed too \u201cintrusive\u201d into less visible positions. And after months of promises that Qatar would recognise that drinking is part of football fan culture worldwide, the sudden change will cause huge anger and upset for travelling supporters.  - while the eyewatering prices are also being called into question.

Am I the only one who feels like I have heard all this before? To give her credit, Home Secretary   is clearly trying to do something to stop the thousands of illegals now coming into our country every week across the  . Under the new agreement, we will pay   an extra \u00a38million a year to stop the small boats setting off from the French coast.  British police officers will be able to observe patrols in France and there will be an increase in the number of French officers patrolling their own coastline. Again, sorry if you feel like you\u2019ve heard all this before. But I certainly have. British governments have been doing deals like this with the French for years. And it always ends up with us paying the French to police their own shores. Sometimes there is a slight change in the number of boats setting off. Sometimes not.  But what this deal, like every previous one can do nothing about is one immovable fact. France does not want these people in its country either. For many years there has been a serious problem with   across the continent. I have reported on it myself first hand from across all of  . Go to any French city outside of the exquisitely preserved centres and you will find whole encampments of illegal migrants.  In the suburbs of   and other cities the authorities often move the camps along, shut them down, hose down the area and push the problem a few yards down the road. But the people who have arrived into France in their hundreds of thousands in recent years are still there. And many are not a blessing to the French state. Too often they form a sullen, often criminal underclass of people. People who have fled  , the Middle East and many other parts of the world in search of a better life.  Some are fleeing genuine persecution but most are fleeing economic problems in their countries of origin.  They have come to Europe for a better life. They rarely find it. Although the open-borders lobby like to pretend that these migrants fill all the work shortages in our countries, no such thing happens. The people arriving illegally into Europe are rarely qualified for anything other than the most basic jobs. And, if they were to enter the workforce in those jobs, they undercut those people in our countries already doing them.  As a result, many of the people enter a sort of criminal, black market underworld. Ideally, all these people who should not be in France would be returned to their country of origin.  But as in  ,   and other countries across Europe, the numbers of illegals are so vast that there is absolutely no prospect of them ever dealing with this backlog.  The numbers are too big. The task is too complex. The hurdles are too many. So what to do? The only real answer is to hope that they go elsewhere. That is what the French have hoped for years and it is what they will continue to hope. The big problem of doing a deal with France is that it is not in France\u2019s interests to actually keep to their side of the bargain. Every thousand migrants who come to Britain illegally are a thousand fewer illegal migrants that France has to deal with.  And the French government knows that at home the issue of illegal migration \u2014 and   migration in particular \u2014 is a political powder keg. It is hard to overstate how hot the French debate on this matter is.  knows that he only holds on to power because his opponents are fractured.  But still the National Rally (formerly the National Front) of   is the main opposition party in the National Assembly.  Support for that anti-immigration party and others only grows as the problem of unfettered illegal migration in France grows. So although the French will always accept our money to police their own shores, the reality is that every blind eye they turn is a blessing for their country. What would we do in that situation? Responding to yesterday\u2019s announcement our own Prime Minister said that the numbers of illegal crossings could be brought down. But   said that there was no \u201csingle thing\u201d that could fix the situation. But that isn\u2019t true. There is. Only a few years ago hardly anybody came across the Channel this way.  They only do now because we have encouraged them to. And encouraged them by allowing everyone to stay. So there is, in fact, a single thing to do to fix the situation. Make it clear that if you break into our country illegally we will send you straight back. Instead of using our naval vessels as a welcoming force, use them as a repelling force. Book a lot of planes and put a lot of people on them. Make it clear that if you pay the smuggling gangs to get into Britain illegally you will have wasted your money. Only that way will the movement dry up. But are either Braverman or Sunak brave enough to do it? We\u2019ll see. DOMINIC Raab is the latest politician to be hit by \u201cbullying\u201d claims. Like  ,   and others, Raab is now in the virtual dock for this \u201ccrime\u201d. I think it\u2019s ridiculous. Real bullying is serious. Especially for the young. But among adults in the workplace?

Well, I\u2019m sorry, but plenty of our lazy, stay-at-home, come-into-the- office-as-rarely-as-possible civil servants deserve to be shouted at. Worse, is that on one occasion Raab is said to have thrown some tomatoes from a salad across a room in a fit of anger and their landing made a noise. I can\u2019t be shocked by this. Now civil servants know that \u201cbullying\u201d allegations are one of their ways to get ministers they don\u2019t like. Heaven forfend that someone should throw a tomato.  But with all these petty claims it\u2019s our civil servants who should have egg on their faces.

When he lands in Qatar this month he will have visited every tournament since 1986 -  across all corners of the globe. And he will match the Guinness World Record for the number of consecutive contests - set by a Venezuelan businessman at Russia 2018. Paul, from Aldridge, West Mids, said: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t go to Qatar, then I guess I\u2019ll be sharing the record. \u201cThe funny thing is that I\u2019m not a die-hard England fan or anything like that - I\u2019m just a   fan. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the wins - it\u2019s the whole thing.

It\u2019s just magic.\u201d Paul has travelled tens of thousands of miles to tournaments including Italia 90, France 98, and Brazil 2014. He jetted to USA 1994 despite England not even qualifying - and travelled to Japan and South Korea in 2002 by bus, train and boat. For me, the best bit about the World Cup is at the beginning, when everyone is there from all the different countries. It\u2019s just magic The 7,000 mile journey - via Iran, Pakistan and China - took two months and raised \u00a35,000 for charity. Paul, an estate agent, revealed his top memory was watching Maradona's infamous goal for Argentina against England in the Mexico 1986 quarter-finals. He said: \u201cI remember that the ticket cost just \u00a312. We were up in the gods in the Azteca stadium. \u201cWe actually didn\u2019t realise what had happened until we got back and watched it on the telly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. But just getting the chance to watch Maradona play was just so special. \u201c Paul also travelled to France 98 and South Africa in 2010 - where Fabio Capello\u2019s dismal England crashed out with just a solitary win. He said: \u201cEngland were awful but we still had a great time.\u00a0 \u201cWe went on safaris, travelled around the country and saw Nelson Mandela step out onto the pitch at the final - it was brilliant. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens on the pitch - if the match is rubbish but you still have a good time, that\u2019s the most important thing. \u201cI think a lifetime of watching West Brom has taught me that.\u201d Paul has paid \u00a3700 for his flights to Qatar and expects to pay between \u00a32-3,000 in hotel costs. He has tickets for England\u2019s three group games against Iran, the USA and Wales and will automatically get tickets for knockout rounds - should Gareth Southgate\u2019s man make it - through the England fan club.

Paul added: \u201cPersonally I think it\u2019s wrong that it is there in the first place. \u201cFIFA has taken over the whole country and it\u2019s a bit of a rip off. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to also tie in a quick trip to Dubai and we\u2019re going to miss the last-16 round to visit Nepal for a week. It is tournament football and you can never tell what will happen. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t decided yet - but if England crash out we might end up going to Pakistan to watch the cricket instead. \u201cThe World Cup is just a great way to see the world. Hopefully I\u2019ve got a few more left in me.\u201d But on England's chances in Qatar, Paul confessed he is \u201cnot convinced\u201d.

Kane, 29, will next week become the seventh person to captain England at two or more World Cups.

{"title": "Brazil are a better team with more prolific Richarlison leading the line instead of Arsenal\u2019s in-form Gabriel Jesus", "author": null, "date": "14 Nov 2022", "content": "ONE of the problems of World Cup punditry, especially when it concerns countries with a strong Premier League contingent, is that people know the players, but not the teams. They have not followed the process by which the side has been constructed. This is especially true in the case of Brazil, where  play in England. The team have clearly benefited from having the same coach in charge for a full cycle - Tite has been in charge for more than six years, and ever since Russia 2018 he has been painstakingly building a team that go to Qatar as justified  .\u00a0 But the questions that are frequently asked in England show, understandably enough, that people have been following the players in the Premier League, but are unaware of how things have been going in the national team. For example - how does Richarlison get in the team ahead of  ? This is an easy answer. The last competitive goal that Gabriel Jesus scored for  came almost three and a half years ago. In twenty matches, starting most of them, he has been on target once - in stoppage time of a friendly that was already won. Richarlison, meanwhile, has seven goals in the last six games, a run of form which has changed the way that Brazil set up their side. A few months ago it was likely that Brazil would go to the World Cup without a centre forward, with two wingers and  as a false nine.\u00a0 Richarlison has forced a change. The coaching staff now agree that the team functions better with a   and Richarlison, uncomplicated and obsessed with the goal at the expense of everything else, is their man. How on earth does Fred get in the team?\u00a0This is a frequent question asked by those who have not seen Brazil. The little midfielder has been in fine form for his country, balancing out the side and making things easier for his team-mates. Brazil\u2019s coaching staff feel that   have not used him well, that they should take more advantage of his lung power, freeing him to run forward rather than restricting him to covering duties. Is the place of Lucas Paqueta at risk?\u00a0 Providing the West Ham man is fit, not at all.\u00a0 Paqueta is vital to the team for two reasons. Firstly, on the pitch he is on the same wavelength as Neymar. Good teams are made of little partnerships, and the link up between Neymar and Paqueta has been one of the best things about Brazil over the last couple of years. But also, his versatility makes him a coach\u2019s dream. There have been matches where Paqueta has carried out three different functions in the course of 90 minutes. Brazil have three different formations - little tweaks on an overall idea of play. , who lines up either as an orthodox attacking midfielder, or as a withdrawn left winger in place of Vinicius Junior, or as a deeper central midfielder instead of Fred.\u00a0And he can also fill in at centre forward. Of course, all of these certainties could crumble in the course of the World Cup.\u00a0The tournament is the result of a process - but it is also like time speeded up, where teams can come together or suddenly fall apart. And something that Tite learned in the last World Cup is that if something is not working, then it should be changed quickly. In the build up to Russia 2018 Gabriel Jesus appeared to have solved Brazil\u2019s centre forward problem.\u00a0Come the competition he lost his form and confidence, and in hindsight Tite felt that he should have been dropped. But now the Arsenal striker is older and wiser.\u00a0It could be his moment. True, he is unlikely to be in the starting line up against Serbia on November 24th. Perhaps during the course of the competition his time will come. But for the time being, Richarlison is there on merit."},

They are up against fierce rivals   in group B, with the big showdown scheduled for November 29. The players will wear a red dragon on their shirt and the reason behind it is very interesting. The red dragon originates from an ancient Welsh legend involving a Celtic king named Vortigern.  After finding a place to build his castle on the hills of Dinas Emrys, Vortigen was warned that his plans for the castle were directly above an underground lake, where two dragons were sleeping. Upon starting the building, Vortigen came across two dragons, one red, and one white.  After a fierce battle, the red dragon won and has gone on to represent a symbol of Welsh pride and independence. A later excavation in 1945 found castle ruins and evidence of a lake dating back to Vortigen's time. Perhaps, dragons aren't just a myth after all. The red dragon was depicted in various battles by British soldiers on their way to Rome in the fourth century. Welsh kings later adopted the emblem to show their authority and power. The country's first official use of the flag is thought to be during the thirteenth century, during the Battle of Bosworth Field in England. Today, the dragon is a symbol of national pride and fearlessness, with the Welsh football team hoping to match it's meaning at this year's  Whereas the Welsh rugby team use the Prince of Wales' feathers as their logo, the football team have adopted the red dragon for the last century and happily make it their monkier.  is also one of the most famous in the world and will be belted out at the World Cup for the first time since 1958.

{"title": "Dream Team World Cup: England\u2019s star players, potential flops and bargain options", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "16 Nov 2022", "content": "ENGLAND players are always immensely popular among Dream Team bosses and that hasn't changed in the build-up to the World Cup in Qatar despite some disappointing results this calendar year. No fewer than five of the eleven most-popular assets in Dream Team World Cup right now are members of Gareth Southgate's squad. With so much attention on the Three Lions' campaign, gaffers need to make sure they've got the optimum combination of players. Let's run through England's star players, potential flops and bargain options... As captain, penalty-taker and biggest goal threat, it's hard to look past Harry Kane when identifying the cream of the crop from Southgate's side. The Tottenham forward already has a World Cup Golden Boot on his mantelpiece and he needs just two more international goals to draw level with Wayne Rooney, England's current all-time top scorer - his goals-to-game ratio is significantly better than the Manchester United legend's. Kane scored 12 goals in 589 minutes during qualification for the World Cup and only Erling Haaland has a superior Premier League tally this season. Injuries to Reece James and Kyle Walker (who has at least made the squad) have left the door open for Kieran Trippier to start at right-back against Iran on Monday. Newcastle's vice-captain has been an astoundingly consistent performer in Dream Team's classic Season game this term and 37.1% of gaffers are backing him to translate his impressive form to the international stage this winter. England defenders racked up points for fun in Dream Team Euros last year and more clean sheets could be on the cards in what looks to be a cagey group that also features USA, Iran and Wales. Euro 2020 ended in heartbreak for Bukayo Saka as it was the Arsenal youngster's saved penalty that handed victory to Italy. However, the 21-year-old is nicely poised for a redemption arc having played a significant role in the Gunners' flying start to the domestic season - he's registered four goals and six assists in the top flight already. He's not a guaranteed starter for England but on current form he probably should be chosen to play from the right - he has a good understanding with Kane. Saka has three goals and three assists in his last ten international appearances. Southgate's faith in his favourite players is admirable but the reality is other teams will see Harry Maguire as a potential weak link. The 29-year-old was fantastic at the last World Cup and was rightfully named in Team of the Tournament following the Euros but more recently he lost his place in Man United's starting line-up after a sustained spell of error-strewn performances. Backing Maguire feels like an unnecessary risk for Dream Team bosses to take - there are safer options in the same price bracket. In no world could Phil Foden be described as a flop. In terms of pure talent, the Manchester City youngster is among England's best assets but Dream Team World Cup managers would be wise to consider Southgate's pecking order. Raheem Sterling is a firm favourite of the Three Lion coach and will almost certainly start on the left despite a drop-off in domestic form of late. Mason Mount is first-choice for the most-advanced midfield role in the 4-3-3 formation and the aforementioned Saka has a strong claim out on the right, where he's outperformed Foden at international level. 22.7% of gaffers would be disappointed to see Foden named on the bench on Monday but it's a real possibility. The best you can hope for in this section is half-decent value-for-money options, tempting ones though... Jude Bellingham has rapidly transformed from a fringe player to someone many fans want Southgate to build the team around - and with good reason. Still just 19 years old, he plays with a maturity beyond his years and Kalvin Phillips' injury setbacks mean the Borussia Dortmund starlet is most likely to start alongside Declan Rice - he's considerably more active in the final third than either of those two more defensive-minded midfielders. Bellingham costs \u00a34m in Dream Team World Cup, which isn't cheap but it's not expensive either. Finally, Luke Shaw is very reasonably priced at \u00a34m, a knock-on effect of Ben Chilwell's unfortunate injury. The Man United defender is the only specialist left-back in the squad and therefore a certain starter - he was also very effective at Euro 2020."},

Not everyone is happy with his decision to back England, with Welsh actor   calling the Prince of Wales\u2019s support for England in the   World Cup as \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d. Sheen said his backing showed a complete lack of sensitivity after he gave Cymru's World Cup rivals a special send-off before the tournament. Prince William told the Three Lions squad: \"The rest of the country is behind you, we are all rooting for you. Enjoy it.\" Both sides play each other in the group stages on November 29. And while his backing, as President of the FA in England, may be understandable to some, it has caused anger in Wales. Sheen said that the heir to the throne should be embarrassed for backing England at the same time as holding the title of Prince of Wales. Sheen  : \"He (Prince William) can, of course, support whoever he likes and as President of the FA his role makes visit understandable - but surely he sees holding the title Prince of Wales at the same time is entirely inappropriate? \"Not a shred of embarrassment? Or sensitivity to the problem here?\" William addressed criticism of his support for England\u2019s   team as Prince of Wales on his first visit to the Senedd in  , today. The future King tackled the subject head on during a light-hearted chat with the Llywydd Elin Jones during a tour of the Siambr. The Presiding Officer showed the Prince her Wales football bucket hat, which she had on her seat inside the chamber and said: \u201cThey play each other in a few weeks time. I won\u2019t ask you!\" But he replied: \"No, it's ok,\u00a0I\u2019m telling everyone I\u2019m supporting both, definitely. I can\u2019t lose. \u201cI\u2019ve supported England since\u00a0I\u2019ve been\u00a0quite small. But I support Welsh   and that\u2019s my way of doing it. \u201cI happily support Wales over England\u00a0in the rugby\u00a0so I\u2019ve got to be able to play carefully with my affiliations. \u201cI worry otherwise if I suddenly drop England to support Wales then that doesn\u2019t look right for the sport either. So I can\u2019t do that.\" He added: \u201cAn England v Wales World Cup final would be the best, that would be pretty good.\u201d He went on: \u201cI\u2019m making sure I\u2019m out there supporting Wales through all the process because I know it\u2019s a big deal for Wales. When I was growing up, Wales weren\u2019t getting through to the tournaments, so I had to make a choice.\u201d The Llywydd told William: \u201cI\u2019m much older than you and when I was growing up Wales weren\u2019t getting through to the tournaments. There had been some horrible results.\u201d An England v Wales World Cup final would be the best, that would be pretty good Wills asked: \u201c1958, I believe was the last one? So it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a huge deal,\u201d she replied. Ms Jones, a football fan, said she would not be going because the World Cup is taking place in Qatar, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that it is in Qatar, but the First Minister is going out and that\u2019s going to be absolutely fine for him to go out, in my view. \u201cBut it\u2019s confused.. we have this great huge happiness about it but then it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s in Qatar and a lot more people could enjoy it. \u201cThe Euros in 2016, they were glorious. I was there at the game when Wales beat Belgium 3-1 and that was absolutely fabulous. \u201cBut we will have the Rugby World Cup in France next year, that will be a big deal,\u201d said William.\u201d  to Qatar after helping to reveal the squad numbers.

The Prince of Wales has been present for huge rugby matches, is patron of the  , has been known to attend   finals and big events during the 2012 London Olympics. But his true sporting passion lies with football. He is a FA president and regularly attends England matches. And this winter he'll be watching on as the FIFA World Cup returns in Qatar.  But who will the heir to the throne be supporting?  Prince William has joked he is supporting both England and Wales in their World Cup 2022 campaigns. However, he gave the England team a send off before they headed off to Qatar, telling them: \"The rest of the country is behind you, we are all rooting for you. Enjoy it.\" But as his royal title is the Prince of Wales, his words have caused a bit of controversy, mostly with Welsh actor Michael Sheen. Sheen tweeted: \"He (Prince William) can, of course, support whoever he likes and as President of the FA his role makes visit understandable - but surely he sees holding the title Prince of Wales at the same time is entirely inappropriate? Not a shred of embarrassment? Or sensitivity to the problem here?\" Prince William has also said: \"I\u2019m telling everyone I\u2019m supporting both, definitely.

So I can\u2019t do that.\" You would be wrong in thinking that William supports the team his dad, King Charles, does. Charles supports Burnley. But when William was younger, he decided to go a different route. William supports Aston Villa and has been present at plenty of their games over the past two decades. Explaining his reasoning for supporting Villa, he said that he didn't want to follow in the footsteps of schoolmates who all chose to support   or Chelsea. Prince William said: \u201cA long time ago at school I got into football big time. I was looking around for clubs. \"All my friends at school were either Manchester United fans or Chelsea fans and I didn\u2019t want to follow the run of the mill teams. \u201cI wanted to have a team that was more mid-table that could give me more emotional rollercoaster moments. \u201c  always had a great history. I have got friends of mine who support Aston Villa and one of the first FA Cup games I went to was Bolton v Aston Villa back in 2000. Sadly, Villa went on to lose to Chelsea. \u201cIt was fantastic, I sat with all the fans with my red beanie on, and I sat with all the Brummie fans and had a great time. \u201cIt was the atmosphere, the camaraderie and I really felt that there was something I could connect with. \"People like Paul Merson were playing and I thought if people like him can play as well as he does, knowing the struggles he was under at the time\u2026this is a club I can support. \"I was also born in \u201882, the year we won the (European) Cup, so I feel the history and pedigree around Villa has always been quite close to me.\" When it comes to the oval ball, the Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge backs Wales. He is patron of the Welsh Rugby Union and is regularly seen at major international fixtures. During the 2015 Rugby World Cup, when England and Wales played each other in the same pool, he was wearing a red Welsh jersey at Twickenham, while Harry wore a white English shirt. Wales won the match 28-25 and the Red Rose were dumped out of their home World Cup a few days later.

The victory led to head coach Cooper moving into club management with Swansea - where he   suffered Championship play-off agony. He is now in charge of Nottingham Forest, leading a stunning transformation in form with the Tricky Trees and earning promotion to the Premier League via the play offs. But for all the successes of Phil Foden and Jadon Sancho, not every member of his victorious team have taken the next step. While some struggle for first-team football, others have fallen out of the Football League all together. We run through which players have made their mark on the senior game and which are yet to hit the big time after their historic win. Anderson was No1 in India and played a crucial role in guiding the Young Lions to victory with his penalty shoot-out heroics against Japan in the last-16. He left Manchester City's academy in 2019 to join American second tier outfit Charlotte Independence and played ten league matches for them. The stopper returned to these shores with Wycombe Wanderers but is yet to play in the league for them and was even sent out on loan to non-league Walton Casuals. Last term, he went on loan with National League South outfit Eastbourne Borough, before signing for Lancaster City for this season - where he has since made 24 appearances. Long considered as a potential long-term successor to Jack Butland at Stoke, the teenager was loaned out to gain first-team experience after the triumph with England. Bursik had spells in non-league with Hednesford Town and AFC Telford United before stints in the Football League with Accrington Stanley, Doncaster Rovers, Peterborough and Lincoln City. He became Stoke's No1 last season before losing his place in January and eventually joining Posh on an emergency loan. Bursik is back at Stoke this term and has played 16 times so far. Ex-Fleetwood boss Joey Barton ended Crellin\u2019s loan move to FC United of Manchester early after the National League North side won just one of 10 games with the then-teenager in 2018. Barton recalled the ace, who made just one appearance for England in India, when he was just 19 and gave him a first-team start in the EFL Trophy. He went back out on loan to non-league Chorley before spending 2020-21 at Bolton in League Two and played 11 times. Back in January, Crellin signed for Everton for an undisclosed fee but is yet to make his Toffees debut. The versatile defender, known as TJ, caught the attention of Mauricio Pochettino, who gave him a first-team debut in Spurs\u2019 7-0 FA Cup third-round win over Tranmere in 2019. Eyoma was a regular for Tottenham\u2019s Premier League 2 side but was also named as a substitute for an FA Cup win against West Ham, having been on the first-team\u2019s pre-season tour. But he went on loan to Lincoln City last season in League One and impressed that much that they bought him permanently from Spurs last summer. He has since made 21 appearances this term. Three months before winning the World Cup, Newcastle academy product Gibson moved to Everton from St James\u2019 Park for \u00a36million. Despite not making a first-team appearance, U23s boss David Unsworth has heaped praise on the teen who can play left-back or central defence. The now England U20 international has gained further experience at Fleetwood and Reading and enjoyed a loan at League One Sheffield Wednesday. Gibson is now on loan at Bristol Rovers, where he has played 10 times. Captained England at the European Championships before scoring in the World Cup final, and then starred in Jody Morris\u2019 Chelsea youth team that won five trophies in a year. But the central defender, who was born in the Ivory Coast, is one of many that struggled to make a mark on the Blues first-team despite impressing for the U19s. And after shining on loan under Cooper at Swansea in the Championship last season, he is now a regular in the Premier League at Crystal Palace after they signed him last summer and has earned three full caps for his country now. However, Guehi was not selected by Gareth Southgate for his World Cup squad this month. After nine years in Chelsea\u2019s academy, the central defender   in 2018 search of first-team opportunities. Panzo made the first-team after impressing former boss Thierry Henry who handed him a full debut in that December\u2019s League Cup quarter-final win over Lorient. However, he struggled and was shipped out to Cercle Brugge in Belgian before he transferred to French second tier side Dijon. Now Panzo find himself with Nottingham Forest, but has only played once and is currently on loan at Coventry City. The World Cup winner was involved in a contract stand-off with Manchester City after failing to make a single senior appearance. The concerns over a lack of first-team games led to Latibeaudiere leaving in 2020 for Swansea after a spell on loan in Holland at Twente. Latibeaudiere has 20 appearances to his name in a little over a year. And after his youth career with England, the ace made his senior international debut with Jamaica in May. Twin of Tottenham star Ryan Sessegnon, versatile defender Steven broke into the Fulham first-team in 2018-19 with 14 Championship appearances. But after he was axed - failing to play in the horror 2019-20 Premier League campaign - he was sent away for a loan spell at Bristol City, then went to Plymouth Argyle. Sessegnon hasn't played for the West London outfit since 2020, and is spending this season on loan at Charlton. Younger brother of former Blue Josh McEachran, George impressed at Chelsea in the youth ranks. But the central midfielder did not manage to progress into the star-studded first team squad. He gained experience with loan stints at Dutch clubs Cambuur and MVV. But he is now without a club after his Chelsea deal expired last summer. The Golden Ball winner at the 2017 U17 World Cup, Foden - who scored twice in the final - is a favourite of Pep Guardiola\u2019s and is also a regular in the England side under Gareth Southgate. The star is one of the biggest success stories from the tournament and already has four Premier League titles, an FA Cup and four Carabao Cup medals in his trophy cabinet. He also helped guide the Three Lions to the Euro 2020 showpiece and is now set to play a key role at the World Cup in Qatar this month. Was given a first-team debut by Pochettino at Tottenham with a substitute appearance in the EFL Cup win over Barnsley - replacing Dele Alli - but Oakley-Boothe never went on to make a regular breakthrough. He struggled with injury problems, which limited his involvement, before leaving Spurs in 2020 without having played a Premier League game for them. But he has made 23 appearances for Stoke in the Championship since his departure. This season, he has taken his talents to Lincoln City, where he has played 13 times. Made his first-team debut before the 2017 World Cup and became the youngest ever Premier League player at 16 years and 263 days old. Gomes made several appearances after that but it was still not enough to keep him at Old Trafford. Despite United's best efforts, the now U21 international quit the Red Devils to join French side Lille in 2020. Most recently, he spent last term on loan at Portuguese outfit Boavista. But Gomes has since returned to Lille, playing 14 times this season. Another successful product of the squad, Sancho replaced Christian Pulisic in the Dortmund first-team, was named Bundesliga Player of the Month soon after and quickly earned an England call-up after the World Cup success. He continued to flourish with the Bundesliga side having bravely quit Manchester City to conquer Europe in 2017. Sancho missed the U17 World Cup final after leaving the tournament midway through to return to Dortmund duty. Now back in Manchester after  , Sancho began to find his form in the tail-end of last season. He looked to be improving under Erik ten Hag this season before injuries struck. And Sancho was left gutted after being axed from England's squad for the Qatar World Cup. Tottenham academy product Kirby left Crystal Palace in January 2019 in search of first-team opportunities after 18 months without a game. The midfielder, now 22, moved to then-League One side Blackpool and went on to spend time at Tranmere Rovers. He was released by the Eagles at the end of the 2021-22 season and is still yet to find a new club. A key figure in the U17 World Cup final, Hudson-Odoi excelled at Stamford Bridge and broke into the Blues first team. Bayern Munich were soon chasing his services after he broke into the senior England set-up. But the winger eventually penned a new big-money deal at Chelsea which coincided with his form dropping. Tasted Champions League success with the club but struggled to get regular minutes under former boss Thomas Tuchel. Is now on loan at Bayer Leverkusen, playing 15 times so far. And reports claim new Chelsea gaffer Graham Potter could recall him in January. Another huge success story from the World Cup-winning squad. After loan stints in Germany at RB Leipzig and with Huddersfield Town, the attacker is now a fully-fledged member of Arsenal's first-team.

Stints at Charlton and Swansea gave Gallagher his first taste of senior football after the World Cup success and that was followed by a spell at West Brom. After starring at Palace, Gallagher is now a fully-established member of Chelsea's first-team. And he also made the cut for England's World Cup squad in Qatar. Golden Boot winner at the U17 World Cup and one of the stars of the tournament, Brewster signed a five-year deal at Liverpool and was tipped to break into the first-team, with Jurgen Klopp a fan of the young striker.

After missing a penalty in the Community Shield following his Liverpool return,   - but it has turned into a nightmare move. The striker suffered relegation with the Blades in his first season and scored just four times last time out. He hs faring little better this term with just one goal in 17 outings. Berkshire-born Loader only scored once in 28 games for Reading after his World Cup success. But the striker, who was back-up to Brewster in India and managed two goals in two games, caught the eye of Portuguese giants Porto and moved there in 2020.

The   and   star, 32, grew up in Sheffield to a Leeds-supporting dad. And   credits his   fandom on his grandad, who bought him a season ticket at Bramall Lane - and a matchday pie every week. The right-back went on to join the Blades' youth team before breaking into the first-team, securing moves to Tottenham and Man City, while becoming a key figure in England's two best major tournaments in recent memory. Walker will also play for England at the Qatar  2022. The right-back is making his return from injury and was selected despite question marks over his fitness. He will not, however, be involved for England's group opener against Iran on November 21. But for Walker, his incredible career all starts with his late grandad - for whom he   to reflect him 'always looking down on me'. Speaking to BT Sport's What I Wore series, Walker revealed: \"It's strange, because my dad's team is Leeds. \"He would say he's a Leeds fan. My grandad who passed away was the big influence for getting me to go down to Sheff Utd games. \"He had a season ticket and he bought me one right next to him. That was a grandfather-grandchild bonding moment. \"We used to go down every Saturday. He used to get me a pie and we'd sit and watch the games. \"It was great memories for me at Sheffield and I think everyone knows how close it is to my heart. \"I hope to go back in the late stages of my career.\" Walker broke into the Blades first-team in 2009 - having joined the youth ranks aged just seven - and made his debut against Leyton Orient in the FA Cup. With injuries tearing the Sheff Utd season to shreds and a Championship playoffs spot on the line, boss Kevin Blackwell turned to Walker. The youngster played the final two league games of the season and impressed so much he kept his place for both legs of the play-offs semi-final and the final - becoming the youngest Sheff Utd star to play at Wembley. While the Blades' Premier League dreams died following a 1-0 loss to Burnley, Walker did make the leap after signing for Tottenham that summer. And Walker revealed his career could have been so different, with Everton also in the running. The Three Lions ace continued: \"[The decision] was massive. There were a few clubs in for me that summer. \"There was Everton or Tottenham. But when I went to Tottenham and saw the manager Harry Redknapp, he just made me feel so welcome. \"I said, 'I've got to go down and play there'. \"What a good decision I've made. It's put me on the path to play for [Man City and England]. \"To play with the players like (Gareth) Bale, (Luka) Modric, (Peter) Crouch, (Jermain) Defoe, (Robbie) Keane, (Ledley) King.. legends of the Premier League.\" But Walker also thanks Aston Villa for 'making him feel like a real Premier League player' after he temporarily joined the Midlands club in 2011, following two other loan spells away from White Hart Lane - one back at Sheff Utd and another at QPR. He said: \"I wouldn't have achieved what I have if I hadn't experience what I did at Villa. \"It put me on the right path, moving in the right direction... it made me feel like I was a Premier League footballer. \"To play there and achieve what I did [at Spurs] was massive.\" In the same year, Walker was handed his England debut against then-world champions Spain. And Walker thanked Fabio Capello - fresh from criticism of his strict regime at the 2010 World Cup - for taking a chance on him. The City ace said: \"It was a great moment. To represent your country at any level.. you've done very well. \"To represent your country at Wembley against the world champions.. I have massive respect for Capello for the faith he showed in me. \"That was ten years ago and I'm still going strong. I still want to continue to play for my country. They're special moments.\" In 2017, Walker made his mega-money move to the Etihad - and has won three Premier League titles in his four years under Pep Guardiola, including 'The Centurions' campaign in his very first season. The defender admitted it hasn't quite sunk in just how much the team has achieved - and doesn't think it will until he's hung up his boots. Walker continued: \"Carabao Cups, Premier Leagues, 100 points, Centurions... never to be done before. \"In that moment - and even now - I don't really appreciate what we've achieved at the club in such a short period of time. \"I think when I retire and look back at it, I'll realise what a special team this is.\" And while his City career has gone from strength-to-strength, Walker has also played a huge role in England's two most-successful major tournaments in living memory: the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020. But Walker reserves all praise for Gareth Southgate. On recovering from the horror defeat to Iceland at Euro 2016, the 63-cap international said: \"The personnel we started getting in... full credit goes to the manager. \"To beat Colombia - on penalties, that hasn't been done in so long - and then reach the semi-finals... \"Now, two more years and we've got to a Euros final. \"That moment, at Wembley, against Germany... the atmosphere was fantastic, all the way through.  \"We can't thank fans enough for the love and support shown throughout the tournament.\" After a tricky patch on and off the pitch, Walker bounced back from the wilderness to become Southgate's No1 right-back in a squad overloaded in that position. When asked about the controversy of him being given the nod - and backing up Southgate's faith by thriving -  Walker said: \"Relief. No one wants to go out onto the field and not do well. \"I believe in myself. I go back to being a ball-boy (at Sheff Utd) and having a chance at Villa, I've always believed in what I can do.\" ."},

But there is a feeling that Maddison is the kind of self-confident fantasy footballer capable of conjuring a game-changing moment here. And that is a far brighter prospect than Maddison was facing up to at Leicester\u2019s training ground on the day Southgate announced his 26-man squad. Maddison, who has played just half an hour of senior international football, said: \u201cI was in Brendan\u2019s office having a chat and he asked me if I had heard anything [from Southgate], and I hadn\u2019t at that point. \u201cHe was just being a good man-manager and putting his arm around me, if I didn\u2019t get the call, and how it would look and how to stay motivated for Saturday\u2019s game [at West Ham] and then enjoy the break. \u201cBut I went back down to the changing room afterwards and had a missed call from Gareth Southgate\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so the heart starts beating. \u201cI still had Gareth\u2019s number saved. I called him back, he gave me the good news and it was all a blur. \u201cI was braced for both \u2014 hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. I hadn\u2019t been in a squad for three years and I\u2019m not naive. But I also had that hope, that I was in good goalscoring form. \u201cI was going to go on holiday. The hope was obviously to be at the World Cup but, if not, it would have been a mid-season break and a chance for me to go on holiday and recharge the batteries for the second half of the season. \u201cI would have gone and put my feet up on holiday with my son and family. \u201cBut after Gareth told me I was in, it was a head-against-the-wall moment, big deep breath, and I called my parents. \u201cMy dad actually cried \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I have seen him cry for years! \u201cThey were happy tears, of course. Your family\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009 they are on this journey with you. \u201cWhen, in previous years, I have been left out of squads after thinking I might have had a chance and had that disappointment, it is spread across the family. Now it\u2019s the opposite. \u201cOn the day of the announcement, I wanted to go back and see my parents in Coventry and give my mum a big hug. \u201cI had dinner at home with my mum and dad, my little boy and my partner. That\u2019s a moment I will cherish forever.\u201d On the day of his selection, Maddison posted a social-media image of himself as a young England fan in face paint, with a David Beckham-style shaven head. And Maddison who, unlike most elite footballers, is an obsessive and knowledgeable watcher of the game, says he feels like an overgrown kid in Qatar. Maddison said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I had the Beckham hair shave. \u201cThe barbers were quite expensive and mum and dad probably couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cHow many times have we watched that Beckham free-kick [against Greece in 2001] that sent us to a major tournament? They are moments you literally dream of. Big moments that get replayed for years, so to get one would be absolutely unbelievable. That would be the real pinnacle. \u201cBut every moment right now is like a \u2018pinch me, I\u2019m dreaming\u2019 moment. \u201cMy house is football-mad. My girlfriend goes crazy because I watch so much. During lockdown, when there were four games a day on, I had them all on. \u201cIn my head I\u2019m still that little boy kicking the ball around the garden or with face paint on.\u201d A World Cup call felt unlikely when Maddison was embroiled in controversy in October 2019. The Leicester man had withdrawn from Southgate\u2019s squad through illness, only to be photographed in a casino while England were being beaten by the Czech Republic in a Euros qualifier. Maddison did, though, earn his only cap as a sub in a 7-0 drubbing of Montenegro the following month. He said: \u201cI thought that might get brought up and I\u2019m actually glad you asked. \u201cPeople forget that I was actually capped by Gareth Southgate and called up after the casino incident and it wasn\u2019t a big deal for Gareth. It got blown out of proportion and some of it was ridiculous. \u201cI think people are just making up an excuse, as to why I haven\u2019t been in the squad. We had already spoken about it and put it to bed. \u201cAt no point did I think it was a closed door and the opportunity had gone. It was just about staying hungry and using the rejection of not getting called up in previous camps as motivation to force my way back in. \u201cThere was no bitterness. Gareth is the England manager and he\u2019s got a lot of talent at his disposal. It was just keeping that mindset of staying hungry, scoring, assisting, affecting games and showing I can be an asset for him. \u201cThere were definitely times where you question, \u2018What am I doing that\u2019s not getting me in the England squad?\u2019 \u201cWhen you feel like you\u2019re playing well, and you might be deserving a call and you don\u2019t get it, you\u2019ve got to tell yourself, \u2018How can I do better to get in?\u2019 Instead of having the arrogance of, \u2018I should be in\u2019.\u201d Everything you need to know about the World Cup  Latest news and updates from Qatar  What are the kick-off times for ALL matches?  - how much does the winner earn?

Mikel Arteta will be happy to see the progress   are making under his leadership as they currently lead the way at the top of the league. This time last season, the Gunners were down in sixth place and were eleven points worse off with question marks over the Spaniard's credentials to manage a top side. However, Arteta has now built a team closer to what he wants, thanks to the summer signings of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko as well as the fine form of loan returnee William Saliba. However, the opposite can be said for   and Liverpool as both are far off from their standards last season. The Blues are down in eighth position with the decision to replace Thomas Tuchel with Brighton's   yet to produce consistent results.

Eriksson called Southgate's decision to include the in-form midfielder a no-brainer, believing he could make an impact as a substitute.  \"Maddison may be a little bit of a surprise but I think he is one of those players who has been in good shape in the Premier League this season,\" he said. \"At this time I think that's important, because there is no preparation between the Premier League finishing and the   starting. \"It's important to pick players who are in good shape. \"Probably not starting, but having a player like him on the bench is very important.\" Harry Maguire's form, though, will be a concern for Southgate. The Manchester United defender was perhaps picked out of loyalty, after struggling at Old Trafford where he has been frozen out of Erik ten Hag's team. Of Maguire, Sven said: \"I don't see him training, so it's a difficult one. \"When he played for Leicester he was number one in the country, but probably because Leicester defended much deeper than Manchester United. \"What happened now, he's not a regular with  , he maybe lost confidence, it's very difficult to know exactly what happened. \"If you look at him during the last games for the national team and compare that to how he was when he played for Leicester, that's two different players. \"But, from the outside it's dangerous to have an opinion. How Southgate is going to handle it, I don't know. He picked Maguire because he trusts him otherwise he wouldn't have been picked.\" The expectation on Southgate's men, after a semi-final appearance at the 2018 World Cup and making the final in the Euros, is for England now to go one further. With that comes pressure. \"One thing is important. When you have a team that has a lot of pressure on them, you have a good team. If there's no pressure, you don't have a good team,\" Eriksson said. \"I think Southgate can handle it. Of course, after the last two big tournaments, the expectation is now to go to the final and to win it. \"What happens if we don't reach the quarter-final. Well, that's football. I don't think Southgate or anyone will think about that. \"In my case, I had three big tournaments with England. The last one, a quarter-final, was not good enough. And I agree, it wasn't good enough. We should have done better. \"I was sacked for other reasons, but I would have been sacked anyhow for only reaching the quarter-final.\" In Gelsenkirchen, at the 2006 World Cup, England were famously dumped out of the competition on penalties. Sven's side failed to convert three of their four penalties, before losing 3-1. The tactician's greatest regret is not hiring a psychologist to help his players cope in such a situation. \"I should have taken a mental coach for England in 2006,\" Sven accepted. \"I thought about it, the coaching team and I talked about it. But in the end, we decided that team, which was very experienced, didn't need it. \"I regret that. That's the thing I regret the most. But it will make you crazy if you think about every time you didn't win a football game. If you got the chance to do it again, maybe you wouldn't do the same thing.\" The bookies don't see a clear favourite - with any one of six teams in with a chance of winning the 2022 World Cup. Sven, who has partnered up with Toshiba  sees it the same way, but has tipped England to come good. \"Among the favourites, England is one of them. They can do it,\" he said. \"It's similar to 2006. Before that World Cup, I thought we could win it. I couldn't see any other teams better than us. And I think it's the same now. Brazil is strong, Argentina is strong, and France, of course, they won it last time.  \"Germany, Spain... but England is as strong as them, at least on paper. Then we shall see what happens at the World Cup. \"Maybe it will be a Brazil v England final? If England don't win, I think Brazil could. They have a lot of strong football players playing in Europe. But England has a good chance.\""},

{"title": "Will Lionel Messi\u2019s World Cup swansong for Argentina land him his first winners\u2019 medal? Predicted line-up and stats", "author": null, "date": "18 Nov 2022", "content": "ARGENTINA'S superstar Lionel Messi announced that this will be his last World Cup.  That will be a relevant factor as the team leader will have his last chance to lift the World Cup, and his retirement will likely impact the chances of   in the 2026 World Cup.  So as  wraps up his international career, the South Americans will have their last shot with their star as their talisman. Brazil, Argentina and even Uruguay have an extra challenge in comparison with the European rivals of the  : they don\u2019t face tough games as often as they wanted to remain in top form. As Argentina and their rivals Brazil have qualified pretty early to the World Cup, it\u2019s fair to say their last big game was the final of  .\u00a0 The Argentinians hadn\u2019t touched any silverware since 1993 and that title was celebrated almost like winning the World Cup. That title may be over a year old, but it certainly boosted the morale of the South Americans. Although on paper Argentina line up in a 4-3-3, there is a defining lack of structure in Argentina\u2019s tactics. Aside from\u00a0Juventus\u2019 \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Ajax\u2019s Lucas Ocampos, there is a significant lack of true wingers in the national pool. However, there is an overwhelming number of diverse and dynamic midfielders.  As a consequence, similar to Spain\u2019s route to glory in 2010, Scaloni\u2019s possession-based tactics look to take full advantage of this depth in the midfield. The backline is fairly straightforward, with the fullbacks having more attacking roles. In the midfield, Leandro Paredes, Rodrigo De Paul, and Giovani Lo Celso offer a balanced and dynamic trio. Additionally, ahead of them, Papu G\u00f3mez and Lionel Messi are almost false wingers, constantly drifting inside to create superiority.  up front, but he is also capable of providing support in possession. Argentina\u2019s tactics are focused on pressuring in the attacking field and creating lots of chances. Scaloni\u2019s team moves a lot and that creates options for the players with the ball to pass it easily and that translates as lots of shots and goals. As a result, there is no set structure or shape they look to maintain. The backline is perhaps the most constant unit, but ahead of them, the players are as fluid and mobile as possible. Their structure in the build-up, as seen below, begins with a line of four behind a packed-up midfield. Scaloni\u2019s men are constantly looking to create numerical superiority around the ball.\u00a0 This can be further illustrated in the example below, against Italy.\u00a0 The same principle is followed in the final third. As they try to breakdown Estonia\u2019s low block, Scaloni\u2019s men create a 5v4 superiority on the left side.\u00a0 Argentina is extremely dynamic in possession, with individual talent and intuition guiding a lot of their actions.\u00a0 Similar to their tactics in possession, there is no rigid structure without the ball,. In the example below, against Brazil, they are able to man-mark every Brazilian player as they focus their build-up on the right side. They are also extremely compact when going about their pressing.\u00a0 In the example below, Peru is nowhere near as structured and organised as   was in the last image. Nonetheless, Argentina advances their high block and creates significant numerical superiority around the ball. In lower blocks, Scaloni\u2019s men revert into a more compact 4-4-2 block, with Lionel Messi being an outlet without many defensive duties.\u00a0 Against Italy, although a loose 4-4-2 can be identified, it is dictated by man references.  (Ts&Cs apply) In transition phases, Scaloni\u2019s tactics adhere to common and modern strategies. With such talented players, when the ball is recovered, they look to immediately launch vertical counterattacks aiming to exploit the chaos that is transitions.\u00a0 In the example below, Argentina launches six players against Chile\u2019s four.\u00a0 The beauty of transitions is how fast and keen they are. Against Chile, they perform a quick combination to reach their centre-forward. Meanwhile, three other players are sprinting forward to support the counterattack.\u00a0 Unsurprisingly, their defensive transition begins with a counter-press.\u00a0 Immediately after losing possession, Scaloni\u2019s men are instructed to instantly pressure the ball and keep the opposition from getting out.\u00a0 Lionel Messi certainly is the star of this team. They have good attackers, but potentially important names \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda and Pablo Dybala are still recovering from injuries, but have chances of being fit enough to play. Papu Gomez and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez are also expected to be protagonists of the Argentine attack. Scaloni\u2019s midfield is the heart of this new-look national team. There are no star players in this section of the pitch, but on the other hand, there are numerous players that are capable of doing the dirty work and working together to supply their dangerous forward line. Lo Celso, De Paul, and Paredes lead the midfield.\u00a0 Albiceleste\u2019s defence has a balance between more experienced players such as Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico and young stars such as Cristian Romero and  Additionally, Romero and Mart\u00ednez are leading Tottenham and Man United\u2019s backlines, respectively.\u00a0 Messi is a player that doesn\u2019t require much explanation. His skills are reflected in his numbers. However, the player never enjoyed the same proportion of success with his national team compared with his bright days at  .  Now at  , the star is living easy days at Ligue 1, but the World Cup is going to be a tougher challenge. This is going to be the last World Cup for him, according to the player, in a recent interview. The psychological factor could be a positive factor or a negative one. After bitter moments wearing the colours of Argentina, he announced his international retirement in the past, but eventually decided to try again and he eventually lifted Copa America last year. The pressure of lifting some silverware is gone and this could be important to pave the way for an Argentine title.\u00a0 Despite not having won the competition since 1986, Argentina enters the 2022 Qatar World Cup as one of the favourites to take the trophy home. Under Lionel Scaloni, Albiceleste have not lost a single match since 2019. With the 45-year-old manager seeming to have found the perfect recipe, we will see if Lionel Messi can finish off his career with a fairy tale ending. However, Argentina will face challenges to see that happening. Group C is somewhat balanced with Mexico and Poland, and they\u2019ll have to fight hard to qualify, but if they do, they\u2019ll certainly be more than ready for the Round of 16."},

Still in the ranks is the prolific  , now of  . However, going into the   in Qatar, the Polish national team has become somewhat of an unknown commodity.\u00a0  A new manager is again in the hot seat, with former Poland U21 boss Czes\u0142aw Michniewicz now in charge going into the tournament.  Young talent has also started to break into the senior squad.  Spezia\u2019s Jakub Kiwior, Feyenoord\u2019s Sebastian Szymanski, and AS Roma\u2019s Nicola Zalewski all likely to be not just on the plane to Qatar, but in the starting lineup for the first group stage match.\u00a0 Through his short time in charge of the Polish national team so far (eight matches), Czes\u0142aw Michniewicz has experimented with different personnel and starting formations to try and find the best solution.  This 3-4-2-1 system has been what the Polish boss has used in their last warm-up games before the World Cup.\u00a0 Looking at the defence,   is an absolute guarantee to start in goal for Poland.  The 66-cap international has become the undisputed #1 between the sticks since \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski\u2019s  last year.  Moving forward into the defensive line, we predict that Michniewicz will stick with three centre-backs.  Aston Villa\u2019s Jan Bednarek and Benevento\u2019s Kamil Glik will likely start, with Spezia\u2019s Jakub Kiwior being a surprise addition to the starting lineup.  Though he only has 4 senior caps to his name after making his senior international debut earlier this year, the 22-year-old has begun to establish himself firmly in the manager\u2019s plans.\u00a0 Moving up the pitch into midfield, 93 cap man Grzegorz Krychowiak will once again be the anchor in the midfield at another international tournament for his country, with the Al-Shabab player being  most experienced starter in midfield.  Next to him will likely be Torino midfielder Karol Linetty, who after an indifferent campaign for his club in the 2021/22 season, has excelled for club and country so far this term.\u00a0 Moving out to the wing-back/wide midfielder positions, Nicola Zalewski and Matty Cash look like the likely starters. In the attacking positions, Sebastian Szyma\u0144ski will likely start alongside Piotr Zielinski in attacking midfield.  Szyma\u0144ski has had a very good start to the season for Feyenoord, with 4 goals and 4 assists across all competitions so far this season.  Finally, leading the line for Poland will be none other than Robert Lewandowski.  Poland\u2019s all-time leading goal scorer with 76 goals for his country will be hoping he can add to that tally at the end of November.\u00a0 Michniewicz opts for a style of play based on quick ball progression by playing it long towards a centre-forward or into the channels for the attackers to run onto.  They are also not a high possession side. Following are a couple of examples of Poland\u2019s attacking style of play that we expect to see them utilise in the World Cup.\u00a0 As we saw in the data metric above, Poland are not a high-possession side.  They instead look to win possession back and then quickly attack, looking for space in behind the opposition\u2019s defence, and playing long balls into these channels.  An example of this is shown above from Poland\u2019s recent UEFA Nations League match against Belgium.\u00a0 In the phase of play above, notice how the player in possession has options to play the ball short and continue to build, notably a square ball to his direct right.  However, with Belgium playing a back three, the wing-back on the far side is advanced and out of position as a result of the last Belgium attack.  The Poland player then plays a long crossfield ball into the space on the opposite side of the field.  This allows them to break the Belgian press, and attack quickly while their defence is not organised.\u00a0 Above shows an even better example of Poland\u2019s preferred route one style of attacking football.  Preceding this image, the ball was played all the way back from the Belgian attacking third to Szces\u0119ny in the Poland net.  He then played the ball out wide to the defender, who was able to send a cross in behind the Belgian defence towards the forward running in behind.  The ensuing long ball can find the forward running in behind the defender\u2019s back shoulder.  However, the shot is sent over the bar, but the movement and pass are, again, what Poland will look to produce plenty of during the World Cup.\u00a0 Another thing to notice in this attacking phase from Poland is that all 10 outfield players are essentially beyond midfield and in the opposition\u2019s half.  While it is rare for them to send all of their outfield players forward, this allows Poland to overwhelm their opposition in the attacking half of the pitch.  It also allows them to be prime targets to win either first or second balls when they are played long from the backline.  As a side that is not possession-oriented, the ability to win these first and second balls is key to being able to attack successfully.\u00a0 While they may be categorised as a long-ball team and not really possession-based, Poland are still capable of using quick passing sequences as a means of getting into the attacking half of the pitch. In the phase of play above, this is demonstrated.  The goalkeeper plays the ball long into the wing-back. The defender can head the ball on first-time to the midfielder who is running unmarked in behind the Dutch fullback who is isolated in a 2v1.  The flicked-on ball is played into the space for the midfielder to run onto and move into the attacking half, making it a 4v4 against the Dutch backline in a span of only three passes.\u00a0 Though Poland will not be the most expansive team to watch from an attacking perspective at this winter\u2019s World Cup, they will create chances.  They also likely won\u2019t create many per game, but all they may need is one to win if their defence can hold firm, which will be analysed in more detail next.\u00a0 Poland are a team that will drop back and sit in a defensive block most times.\u00a0 Their high PPDA, in the 66th percentile, also indicates that they don\u2019t tend to press very high up the pitch.  With that said, Poland will adapt their game plan defensively to whatever it may call for.  Following are some examples of Poland in the defensive phase.\u00a0 The image above shows Poland\u2019s defensive shape and shows why they rank highly in blocked shots and recoveries in their own third. In their back-three system, they defend in a back five, with it turning into a 5-3-2 defensively.  Notice how eight outfield players are behind the ball with the midfield and defensive lines staying tight and compact, not allowing much space at all centrally.  Poland allows the space out wide for teams to attack them, but can stay tight and compact to not allow the play to get moved centrally.\u00a0 That is exactly what happens in the defensive phase shown above, as Belgium are unable to move the ball centrally as a result of Poland\u2019s defensive numbers in this area.  Due to this, the ball is closed down by the Polish defenders in the wide area and they can eliminate the Belgian attack.\u00a0 The defensive phase of play above shows another tactic that Poland tends to do when they are in a low defensive block.  After they force the play into the wide channel, the wing-back, along with the ball side midfielder, look to close down the player in possession, with them looking to win back possession or force them to play backwards.\u00a0 In this example, the Wales winger is forced to play the ball backwards, allowing the Polish defence to relieve some pressure.  Notice also how Poland have numbers back in the box defensively, and because they are strong in the air, they would consider themselves favourites to be able to clear the ball away from danger if a cross were to have been sent into the box.\u00a0 This final example also shows Poland looking to double up against the player in possession out wide.  Once again, the   is forced to play the ball backwards, as there are no options for him to play forward to in advanced positions. With the Polish defence forcing the Dutch to play the ball backwards, it once again allows them to reset defensively.\u00a0 As this section has illustrated, Poland are a team that prefers to sit back in a low block and absorb pressure when they lose possession.  However, with that being said, don\u2019t expect Poland to just sit back in a low block defensively at all times; they may alter their defensive   at times based on the opposition.\u00a0 With Poland not being a possession-oriented side under Michniewicz, transitional moments are some of the most dangerous attacking moments for the team.  The image above shows a good example of exactly what Michniewicz\u2019s side is capable of when regaining possession in vulnerable areas for the opposition.  After Belgium lost possession in Poland\u2019s final third, the Polish players were able to break quickly on a counterattack as a result of Belgium pushing a lot of their numbers forward.  Seven of Poland\u2019s outfield players can break, allowing them to possibly engage in a quick attacking move.\u00a0 The image above shows another example of Poland attacking quickly as a result of a turnover by the opposition in a dangerous area.  After the ball is turned over by the Netherlands, Poland can quickly counter to try and create a goalscoring opportunity.  In this phase of play above, the Dutch full-back is caught out of possession, allowing for the ball to be played into the wide channel and behind the Dutch centre-backs.\u00a0 Poland will be dangerous in transitional moments, so this will be something that other sides need to watch out for come World Cup time.\u00a0 The attack is where Poland possess their game-changers. Obviously, there\u2019s Lewa. But don\u2019t forget Milik and Piatek - both more than capable of having an impact in Qatar. Poland try to play direct from midfield, so Sebastian Szyma\u0144ski is a key member of the group - Linetty, Zielinski, Krychowiak, Villa\u2019s Matty Cash, Frankowski and Zalewski all have decent long passing accuracy stats to make this effective. In the final third, Szyma\u0144ski and   will be key to supply their man man. As we said, Poland will sit in a low black defensively and will rely on the aerial strength of their three from four main centre-backs - Glik, Kiwior, Bednarek and Wieteska. It\u2019s Lewandowski - shock.  Given the start he has made at  where he still scores goals for fun (turn a blind eye to how important those goals are in the really big games) and the fact he is the Polish all-time record scorer it is no surprise he is the man we expect to be key to their progress. His goal stats throughout his career are phenomenal. Lewa has to conserve his energy just a little bit more nowadays, but he is nowhere near the Ronaldo level of being carried. Enjoy him while you can, he won\u2019t be around forever! The lazy assumption is \u201coh they\u2019ve got Lewandowski, they are a dark horse\u201d - but, really, Poland are not.  They should get out of the group - though that is not guaranteed with Mexico pushing them hard for second place.  If they do emerge from the groups, then we would predict a Round of 16 exit and Lewa waving farewell to major tournaments."},

{"title": "What is the offside rule and how does it work?", "author": "Warren Haughton", "date": "18 Nov 2022", "content": "THE offside rule is one of the most fundamental laws of football. But many are still confused about how it actually works. Here SunSport takes a look at the rule and how it works. If you have always been confused by offsides, don't worry, the law has become more vague and confusing in recent years. The interpretation of the offside rule has changed over the decades to help the attacking team, however the essential body of the ruling has never changed. The offside law dates back to football rules made by English public schools in the nineteenth century. The rule states that an attacking player is in an offside position if any part of their body - except hands and arms - is in the opposing team's half and there's no opposing player between them and the goalkeeper before the ball is played forward. Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself, the moment the player in the offside position plays the ball or attempts to play the ball, then they will be seen as \"actively involved in play\" and that is when the offence occurs. A player can also be flagged offside if the ball is played to them from their own half and the player is standing in the opposing half the moment the ball is played. Being ruled offside on a football pitch is an offence. When a player is flagged the only sanction is that the ball is given to your opponents to restart play in the form of a free kick in their own half of the pitch. A player can only be judged to be in an offside position if they are in the opponents half when the ball is played forward. The old rule stated no attacking player should be in front of the ball when it was kicked forward. But the law has changed and adapted over time to make it more entertaining, understanding for fans and to allow attacking players more opportunities to score goals. The game law makers IFAB (International Football Association Board) have adjusted the rule saying a player will be considered to be offside when they make a clear attempt to play the ball, be close to the ball and have an impact on the opponent, or to make an obvious action to have an impact of the opponents. In other words if you are offside you have to stay still and allow play to continue while you move back into an onside position. And now with   in play,  .

{"title": "World Cup hosts Qatar will win plaudits by gaining a single point in their group \u2013 predicted line up and stats", "author": null, "date": "18 Nov 2022", "content": "Nations generally have success when hosting the  . Six of the eight champions have won a title when hosting, including Uruguay\u2019s win in 1930 and victory in 1966. South Korea finished fourth in 2002, albeit with the assistance of questionable refereeing decisions; this is the type of result Qatar will be dreaming of. Contrastingly, South Africa in 2010 are the only host nation that failed to advance beyond the group stage. In a group with an exciting Ecuador side, the AFCON reigning champions in Senegal, and a   team unbeaten in 15 games, many will expect a group-stage elimination for Qatar. Let\u2019s have a look at how Qatar play and what you can expect to see on the pitch. If Qatar are to perform at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, their continuity across the last few years will be essential. From the predicted starting XI below, they have registered   appearances, an astonishing average of   caps per starter. Four of the predicted starters have collected 100+ caps, with captain Hassan Al Haydos being Qatar\u2019s most-capped player with   appearances. Under manager F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez, Qatar have deployed a   in recent years. This consistency has also been aided by their World Cup preparations. Building up to this historic tournament, Qatar have undergone multiple training camps and began their third and final preparatory phase in October ahead of the opening game against Ecuador on the 20th of November. None of the   players selected for the final preparatory phase have appeared in the   so far this season, with full focus on the World Cup. The final consistent link in the Qatar national team is the Aspire Academy, a hub of sporting excellence in Doha. A considerable contingent of the squad came through the football programme at the Aspire Academy. F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez left   to join the Aspire Academy in 2006 and has been in Qatar ever since, working his way up from the youth sides to his senior team appointment in 2017. In possession, Qatar are not a ball-dominant side.  In the last year, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez\u2019s team have averaged 46.63% possession with their approach tending to focus on resisting pressure and fast-paced attacks. From the eight games in which Qatar have had less than  % possession, they attempted more shots than their opponents in six of them. From goal kicks, though, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s side mainly play short.  The short goal kicks are often two-yard passes to the central centre-back, Boualem Khoukhi. This can, in essence, create Qatar\u2019s threatening moments from their own goal kicks by attracting opponents into Qatar\u2019s defensive third before playing behind them to face their own goal.  Boualem Khoukhi is capable of playing these longer passes, averaging   progressive passes per 90 with a strong accuracy of  % for Al Sadd in the Qatar Stars League last season. Right centre-back Bassam Al Rawi is Qatar\u2019s best ball-playing defender, retaining useful passing range to bypass opposition pressure or switch the point of attack from right to left. With the two wing-backs pushing forward, the midfield three will remain ahead of the defence in the build-up phase rather than joining the forward line. The midfielders will have staggered positioning to provide different options and aid   out of the defence.  Attacker Akram Afif is often given full freedom to roam and influence Qatar\u2019s attacking play wherever. With a tendency to operate in and around the left half-space, Afif regularly drops into the midfield or unoccupied spaces to receive freely from the centre-backs. As Qatar\u2019s key player, Afif is the usual target for the Maroon\u2019s attacks. However, his tendency to drop deep or wide to the left can leave striker Almoez Ali  . Learning from manager   at Al Duhail before joining the national team camps, Ali is impressive with his back to goal given his isolated circumstances. He has a comfortable first touch and uses his body to resist pressure, whilst also offering accurate passing to build attacks. After a sustained spell of possession, Qatar\u2019s attacking shape under S\u00e1nchez becomes more of a  . With their   approach against stronger teams, we wouldn\u2019t expect Qatar to sustain attacking pressure too often against World Cup quality but their shape naturally becomes a  during attacking transitions too. With the two wing-backs remaining high and wide whilst Almoez Ali is central, support will push up from deep. Out of possession, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez sets Qatar up to defend in a  . The two wing-backs are attached to the defensive line to create a flat five. The wing-backs generally only move into the wide areas when the opposition winger is receiving by the touchline. Due to the congested space in central areas from the back five and midfield three, their overloads allow the centre-backs to  an opposition attacker that is dropping off. However, once the attacker travels in front of the Qatar midfield, the centre-back will move back into position. An example of this can be seen in the figure below against Chile. Former   attacker   has dropped away from right centre-back Bassam Al Rawi, who initially followed S\u00e1nchez. Receiving off the centre-backs, S\u00e1nchez has possession in the left half-space and immediately attracts pressure from Qatar\u2019s ball-side midfielder Hassan Al Haydos. Akram Afif lacks defensive work rate, typically just roaming to positions that could threaten in attacking transitions. This allows the opposition\u2019s defenders time on the ball with the opportunity to step into midfield. Daley Blind\u2019s exceptional passing ability and Nathan Ak\u00e9\u2019s assured progression have the quality to penetrate Qatar\u2019s midfield and retain numbers in the front line. Senegal and Ecuador also have defenders that can accelerate attacks and break through Qatar\u2019s structure, like Pape Abou Ciss\u00e9 and William Pacho. When the opposition have possession in deeper areas, attempting to progress into the final third, Qatar\u2019s wing-backs occasionally jump out of the defensive line to press the opponent\u2019s full-backs. Qatar\u2019s out-of-possession focus is to absorb pressure in their defensive structure, limiting openings and space in and around the defensive line whilst conceding spaces in deeper areas. As a result, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez\u2019s side on average allow the opposition to play   passes per defensive action. This is a stark contrast from the high-pressing approaches of Senegal, Ecuador and the Netherlands. With their sit-back and counterattack approach, attacking transitions are crucial to Qatar\u2019s success. In the last year,  % of Qatar\u2019s counterattacks have ended in shots, averaging at over   per game, which is a decent efficiency for F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez\u2019s side. Ecuador and the Netherlands are generally quite good at limiting opposition counterattacks, with Senegal potentially the opponent Qatar will have the most success in attacking transitions against.  Nevertheless, the Maroon will certainly threaten with counterattacks against any opponent, and it would be required to progress beyond the group stage. The image is an example of Qatar\u2019s counterattacks against Chile. Akram Afif, the player in possession, is the primary receiver of forward passes to trigger counterattacks as a talented ball carrier. In defensive transitions, Qatar have less of a focus on counter-pressing with their intentions to rush back into a solid defensive shape. Qatar\u2019s starting striker partnership of Almoez Ali and Akram Afif contains their best two players. In possession, it is clear that F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez wants them to receive the ball as frequently as possible. Akram Afif has the freedom to drop during the build-up phase to receive in space off the centre-backs, whilst also having the license in rest-attack to drift into areas where he thinks Qatar can best progress and penetrate. Almoez Ali is much more of a selfless player. Willing to take on Afif\u2019s defensive workload whilst remaining compact, his attacking game is also really strong. He can resist pressure with his back to goal and find supporting teammates with accuracy, whilst registering   goals and   assists in   games for Al Duhail. Qatar\u2019s expected starting midfield of pivot player Karim Boudiaf, box-to-box midfielder Abdulaziz Hatem and attacking midfielder Hassan Al Haydos has a wealth of experience and balanced technical qualities. All three are willing to cover ground defensively, with Boudiaf tending to sit in front and protect the defence with his aerial and ground duelling ability. Al Sadd\u2019s Al Haydos provides riskier attacking intent and has incredible chemistry with key player Akram Afif. We expect Abdelkarim Hassan, Bassam Al Rawi and Boualem Khoukhi to be guaranteed starters for Qatar at the World Cup, but manager F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez has a few options to complete the back five. Left-footed Hassan has been deployed as the left-sided centre-back and left wing-back. Meanwhile, Al Gharafa\u2019s Homam Ahmed is a suitable, consistent player for the left wing-back role as Hassan\u2019s back-up or alongside Hassan. Portugal-born Pedro Miguel has also played left centre-back but has spent most of his career playing at right-back. Khoukhi and Al Rawi will start in the centre and right of the three centre-backs respectively, with Tarek Salman another option for the left centre-back spot. Akram Afif is a right-footed attacker at the heart of Qatar\u2019s attacking play. The 2019 Asian Footballer of the Year often operates as the left winger for Qatari club Al Sadd but F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez deploys Afif in a strike partnership with Almoez Ali. As mentioned earlier, Afif is allowed to drift into different positions to receive possession and influence the game as much as possible. He can take too many touches in deeper phases, which will be punished on the biggest stage and was punished by Chile\u2019s Alexis S\u00e1nchez in September. He is essential to Qatar\u2019s counterattacks with his quality ball manipulation and ability to skip past challenges making him the target for attacking transitions. His responsibilities also include set pieces, with his eye-catching afro regularly seen over the Maroon\u2019s free-kicks and corners. Being realistic, Qatar will be playing just the three games in their World Cup. A single point gained could be considered a success - potentially in the opener against Ecuador. Other than that, we will remember Qatar as the venue not the football team."},
{"title": "Iran will give England tough test under World Cup veteran Carlos Queiroz \u2013 predicted line-up and team profile", "author": null, "date": "18 Nov 2022", "content": "IRAN have qualified for five previous World Cup editions, including three of the last four, but have never made it into the knockout rounds. The last two World Cup tournaments that  qualified for were in 2014 and 2018, so this winter will be the third on the bounce.  In all three,  by the former Manchester United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz who won two Premier League titles and even the  Champions League alongside the great  . However, Queiroz didn\u2019t actually lead Iran to qualification this time around.  From 18 matches, the Portuguese\u2019s predecessor Dragan Skocic won 15 matches to lead the Middle Eastern team to the coveted competition. In the summer, Skocic was dismissed after losing two of their last three matches before being reinstated by the Iranian FA for two months.  The Croatian coach was then relieved of his duties once more, with Queiroz being reinstated as the manager in what was one of the most peculiar pre-tournament sackings since J  from Spain in 2018. Nevertheless, having been drawn into a relatively difficult group alongside  , Wales and the USA, Iran may fancy their chances in at least two of those matches. Predicting the starting lineup that   will look to use in the World Cup was extremely difficult given that the 69-year-old has been in charge for very little time \u2014 two matches overall, both of which were friendlies. However, from these games, it became apparent that Queiroz favoured the deployment of the 4-1-4-1 with a number \u20186\u2019 protecting the space between the backline and the more advanced midfielders. Of course, this is just the shape out of possession as when  , the wingers push higher, holding the width to create a typical 4-3-3 attacking structure. Iran are not a possession-oriented side, unlike England and the USA in the same group.  Their style of play is much closer to that of Wales.  Queiroz\u2019s side are flexible with their attacking approach, which is potentially the best way to describe it. This means that not only can Iran hold possession and attempt to build their way through the thirds of the pitch, but they can also drop deeper to drag the opposition up the pitch before hitting them on the break. The different tactics depend on the opponent on the day.  For instance, in Iran\u2019s two recent friendlies against both Uruguay and Senegal, the team played very different in each match. Versus Senegal, Queiroz\u2019s men were holding their compact shape while the African nation dominated the ball.  Meanwhile, against the South Americans, Iran had much more possession and were allowed to build up from the back due to Uruguay\u2019s lack of pressing. When Iran do play out from the back, the set-up is rather conventional as Queiroz is not looking to reinvent the wheel, but to merely make sure it turns. The fullbacks stay relatively low to provide wide support for the centre-backs in case the ball needs to be circulated out wide. Furthermore, the central defenders split wider which allows the single pivot to drop in and out of the backline. Unfortunately, for a country like Iran, passing out through the pivot is extremely difficult. It requires a high level of technical ability from the midfielders whereas Queiroz prefers his \u20186\u2019 to possess more defensive acumen than attacking proficiency. Former Reading player Saeed Ezatolahi has been the pivot in each game for Team Melli so far and has resembled a midfielder who is far better out of possession than on the ball. Tasked with being the link man from defence to attack, the previous image portrays all of Ezatolahi\u2019s passes under Queiroz across the two international friendlies he has been in charge of. The Iranian midfielder has primarily played squared passes or more direct passes into the channels, offering little to no central penetration through the lines. Knowing that they perhaps don\u2019t possess the required technical nous to build up through the pivot, Iran tend to combine on the flanks in order to progress the ball from deeper areas of the pitch. The 4-1-4-1/4-3-3 offers the perfect opportunity for wide overloads and combination play to naturally formulate as shown in this example.  With the move having been initiated by the right centre-back, Iran\u2019s right-winger, right-back and right central midfielder all combine to break through Uruguay\u2019s mid-block into the space behind. The side\u2019s average possession shape also shows this. Look out for how congested the wide areas are and how much stronger the links are on the flanks as opposed to the middle of the pitch: Iran are really vertical with their play. Queiroz is not a major fan of having his players hold onto the ball for long periods of time.  This increases the possibility of mistakes in dangerous areas. Instead, the experienced coach instructs his men to always look for the first pass forward where they can penetrate the opposition\u2019s defence with runners in behind. This means that the centre-forward must always be occupying the centre-backs and causing havoc by playing off the shoulder, while the players under the ball have to look as far as possible to try find him. 32-year-old Karim Ansarifard has performed this role well so far for Iran and has offered both depth and physicality when challenging in the air for flick-ons and second balls. Out of possession, Iran are dogged. Queiroz shows his true Portuguese pragmatism and wants his side to be very disciplined out of possession. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the nation must be wasteful in possession and revert into a deep defensive block when on the back foot.  Team Melli do press high up the pitch and look to win the ball back as close to the opponent\u2019s goal as possible. Queiroz instructs his players to apply a mix of a zonal and man-marking pressing structure.  This means that from the get-go, Iran, using the centre-forward as an initiator, will force the attacking team into one half of the pitch where they will then go man-to-man, using the touchline as an extra defender to try and regain possession. In Queiroz\u2019s two games in charge thus far, the side have registered 19 ball recoveries in the opposition\u2019s half, showing that they do in fact like to press high. Lower down the pitch, though, the shape does become far more compact. There is less intention to win the ball as there is to remain narrow between the lines, giving the opposition no space to play within Iran\u2019s defensive block. Since Queiroz has been using a 4-3-3 in possession, the block reverts into a tight 4-1-4-1 with the wingers dropping back and the number \u20186\u2019 operating in a zonal role, picking up any players that drift into the space between the midfield and backline. The objective in this phase is to keep the opposition players from reaching anyone inside the block, ensuring that play is always circulating either out wide or in front of the defensive unit where it can be contained. However, this is something that Iran have not quite mastered just yet. In the two friendly games so far during the 69-year-old\u2019s tutelage, Senegal and Uruguay were finding it far too easy to reach their best players between the lines and create dangerous chances. If Iran are to stifle England, Wales and the USA\u2019s best attackers who operate in these spaces, they need to be much more compact and cooperative with one another. During attacking transitions, Iran can be rather dangerous, especially when the team are sitting deeper against a more possession-oriented opponent and are waiting for the right moment to pounce with a counterattack. When Team Melli break, they want to be as direct as possible with their attacking transitions, looking to play to the feet of the centre-forward who drops short instantly, dragging defenders out of position and allowing runners to move into the space he has vacated. Nevertheless, it is during defensive transitions that Iran struggle so much.  This comes back to the lack of energy in the midfield area, primarily due to the fact that the squad is ageing and has very little youth, particularly in the middle of the park. During  , there were several key moments, particularly against the technical dribbling quality and blistering speed of Senegal\u2019s attack, where the players were carved open by counterattacks in the midfield. Here, Iran\u2019s midfield and backline stepped up to counterpress after the side lost the ball.  The counterpressing was far too lethargic and so, Senegal played through it easily. From there, the African nation were given most of the pitch to brear down on goal against just the Iranian centre-backs. Moments like this must be curtailed if Iran are to have any chance at all to survive in the group with England, Wales and the USA. The backline is where Iran may struggle the most in terms of quality. Guys like Shojae Khalilzadeh and Ehsan Hajsafi could provide much-needed experience at the back on such a grand stage but would leave the team lacking a lot of pace in the defensive line that England, Wales and the USA could exploit with runners in behind. Mohammad Kanaani and Sadegh Moharrami will be tasked with providing the pace at the back alongside the two veterans, but the side\u2019s poor goals-conceded record may hamper their progression from the group phase and put a lot of the burden of qualifying for the knockouts on the forward line. The former Reading midfielder Saeed Ezatolahi is undoubtedly Iran\u2019s best defensive player in the middle of the park.  The 26-year-old will be integral to breaking up play and protecting the space between the lines for Queiroz in his 4-1-4-1 as the number \u20186\u2019. Ezatolahi could also be vital for Iran in the attacking phases at finding runners in behind the backline, something he has been tasked with doing so far under Queiroz in his second spell. Providing Ezatolahi performs his role well, it could free up both Saman Ghoddos and Milad Sarlak to help the team move the ball forward in more attacking areas.  Meanwhile, Iran have experienced heads like Vahid Amiri and Omid Ebrahimi who can come on from off the subs bench to provide some calmness to the side. Mehdi Taremi will be vital for Iran this winter. The FC Porto striker has been in incredible form for his club and the national side will be hoping this translates onto the pitch in Qatar at the World Cup. However, Iran can also call upon the help of Karim Ansarifard who has been performing very well for Omonia Nicosia in Cyprus.  Many will have caught a glimpse of the 32-year-old during Omonia\u2019s home and away matches versus in the Europa League where he caused trouble to the Red Devils\u2019 backline on numerous occasions and even scored in the home fixture. Furthermore, Team Melli have players such as Feyenoord\u2019s wide-man Alireza Jahanbakhsh, formerly of Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League.  Capable of playing on the right and left, Jahanbakhsh could be crucial for the Iranians, even if it is off the bench as an impact substitute. With it being touch-and-go about whether or not   will make it to the World Cup this winter, we have decided to select FC Porto star Mehdi Taremi as the star performer for Iran ahead of the coveted competition. Taremi has been in flying form for the Portuguese champions and is one of the top goalscorers in the Primeira Liga right now. Looking at his metrics, it\u2019s easy to see why the 30-year-old will be integral for Team Melli under Queiroz. Having been used as a winger so far under the Portuguese coach, Taremi can play anywhere along the frontline, although he is strongest up front. Not only are the striker\u2019s attacking metrics exceptional, but also his defensive stats, showing that the experienced number \u20189\u2019 will be useful when his side are out of possession at   and intercepting the opposition\u2019s passes. If Iran are to defy the odds and progress from the group phase, they will need Taremi to be on top form. To progress from a tough group Iran need to be unbreakable, defensively, in each game. Team Melli simply cannot go toe-to-toe with these three nations who possess some of the most decorated players in Europe, including multiple Champions League winners as well as serial title collectors. In order to cause damage, Iran will need to do what they do best; soak up pressure, hit the opposition on the break, and when they are in the attacking phases, play as vertical as possible. However Iran lack the quality required to get out of such a difficult group and so, will likely finish bottom of the quartet."},

The 22-year-old's extraordinary development in such a short space of time is inspiration for players hustling at the bottom end of England's football pyramid. Ndiaye fought his way up through Boreham Wood,   U23s and a loan stint in the Northern Premier League to make it to Qatar.  And he will be praying for a chance to make his way onto the pitch for Senegal, who are still reeling after of the tournament.

Ecuador also has key players from the Premier League and Bundesliga, which means there\u2019s top talent in all areas of the pitch. As mentioned, their   - and he is vital during the defensive phase. He\u2019s there to recover the ball and start the attack. Caicedo is their key player for many reasons, he contributes with defensive actions in a way that allows other teammates to attack more. On some occasions, they may form a 4-4-2 to provide more protection for the full-backs. The youth and quality of Ecuador makes them a dangerous team when making fast transitions and creating counterattacks. The Ecuadorians have well-known names in this area. Brighton\u2019s Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n is one of the most important players of this Ecuadorian team, mostly in the attacking phase. Bayern Leverkusen\u2019s Hincapi\u00e9 is also a strong option at the back. Not all teams in the World Cup have defenders in the Premier League and Bundesliga, so that could make a difference. They have a Bundesliga player here too in Carlos Gruezo. The 27-year-old midfielder from Augsburg has a great understanding of this position, and he tactically knows to perfection how Ecuador likes to play. Patrickson Delgado could be an interesting name to keep an eye on, providing depth in the centre of the pitch.\u00a0 As we\u2019ve said - Mois\u00e9s Caicedo is the key player in the team. In summary, they have some of their best talent in the area of the field. Their team has some experience in the attack, with former\u00a0 \u00a0player Felipe Caicedo. Normally, Enner Valencia comes off the bench to play as a striker or on the left wing too. Wingers provide speed and also ball-control as they usually play inverted thanks to the threat that full-backs provide to the team. Gonzalo Plata on the right and Rommel Ibarra on the left could be the regular starters, but Jeremy Sarmiento could also play on the wing as well as a 10, plus they have the experienced \u00c1ngel Mena. Thinking of Gustavo Alfaro\u2019s squad, line per line and position per position, in the end it was an easy choice having Mois\u00e9s Caicedo as the key player - given we\u2019ve mentioned him time and time again. It's important to have in mind some facts that explain why Caicedo is Ecuador's key player.  This is a player that competes in  . The midfielder has numbers close to the league average. And that is very important to have in mind: we're talking about the Premier League and the midfield of the Premier League. The player has numbers that are well-distributed too. He contributes with defensive action as well as during the attacking moments, and he is helpful during the transition between those moments with good passing stat. The South Americans have a team with a few players active in top leagues like the  and Bundesliga. The team also has players in intermediate and developing leagues like the MLS and the Liga MX (Mexican League), as well as their domestic league. Their key player has plenty of big club interest - and this tournament could be a big platform for him to secure a massive move. It's hard to say the Ecuadorians are favourites against the hosts Qatar in the opening game because the performance of home teams can be hard to predict, but they surely have what it takes to fight for a spot in the Round of 16. If they get through, they could be a team to avoid in the next round."},

{"title": "An inspired World Cup campaign might finally turn the last of Neymar\u2019s naysayers into believers", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "11 Nov 2022", "content": "IF you want to gauge how football literate somebody is then simply ask them their opinion of Neymar. This is a useful litmus test. If they focus primarily on the Brazilian's penchant for diving and his perceived prima donna attitude over his outrageous talent then that should raise red flags. If they dare label him 'overrated' then that's your cue to disregard their footballing intellect entirely. You don't have to like Neymar, the way he carries himself on the pitch (and off it) may rub you up the wrong way, that's fine, but if you allow your assessment of his character to blur your opinion of him as a footballer then you commit foolish mistake. Forget detailed analytics for a moment - although the spreadsheet enthusiasts will tell you PSG's No10 is freakish talent - and consider this: every player can be judged in terms of style and substance. There are individuals who look slick and effortless on the pitch but perhaps don't boast the necessary quantifiable returns to be ranked among the game's greats. Then there are players who are mightily effective but are somehow lacking in aesthetic beauty - this isn't a major flaw by any means but we must remember that sport is something to be enjoyed, an entertainment product we seek out between the hours donated to work or sleep. In both aspects, style and substance, Neymar excels. The 30-year-old needs just two more international goals to equal Pele's all-time record of 77 for Brazil having already surpassed the likes of Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Zico, Romario and Ronaldo. He has over 600 goal involvements in his professional career at a rate of one every 82 minutes. His trophy case has been reinforced many times over, not least in 2015 when he won a memorable treble with Barcelona - his goal in the Champions League final to seal the feat was his 39th of the season. His numbers alone are astonishing and yet it would be a crime to judge Neymar on stats as he is one of the most entertaining players to ever grace a pitch. He is one of the greatest dribblers of all time and he is blessed with a distinctly Brazilian flair for showmanship: rainbow kicks, nutmegs, spins, backheels, that midair rabona first touch thing he does. His highlight reel ranks alongside those of the most skilful players in history. And yet he is mocked for the doing the very same things that made Ronaldinho a hero to millions - a bare-faced hypocrisy - because he is not seen as affable as his compatriot. To deny Neymar the footballer is to deny a joyous phenomenon. However, while many the of the sticks used to beat the Selecao's No10 are hollow, criticism of his failure to deliver Brazil a major international trophy are partially valid. The 2013 Confederations Cup is his only honour in international football - the Copa America and the World Cup have both eluded him. More generally, Brazil's lack of success on the grand stages in recent years has caused much pain and frustration in a country that is arguably more entwined with the sport than any other. As his nation's best player, Neymar has often had to shoulder the responsibility and it will be no different this winter with Brazil the bookmakers' favourites to triumph in Qatar. 2014 was Neymar's first World Cup - Dunga famously ignored a public petition calling for his inclusion in the 2010 squad - and he was brilliant on home soil, scoring four goals and providing two assists before his campaign was cut short by an injury sustained in the quarter-final. You don't need reminding what happened when Brazil met Germany in the semi-final without their top scorer or suspended captain Thiago Silva... Neymar was pretty good again in 2018 although his inclination to buy free-kicks instead of riding challenges disrupted his side's rhythm at times - still he scored two goals and provided an assist before being dumped out by Belgium in a quarter-final remembered for an Eden Hazard masterclass. 2022 may not necessarily be Neymar's last chance to claim Brazil's sixth World Cup but it'll be the last tournament that coincides with his peak years - he's been sensational for PSG this term. If he were to inspire the Selecao to glory then perhaps he would finally earn the reputation he deserves as a generational footballer - surely even the most stringent naysayers would nod their approval if he were to sprinkle the true samba style on this winter's tournament? Nearly a quarter of Dream Team World Cup managers are backing him to do something special - his ownership of 24% makes him the fourth-most popular forward in the game. Tite's side face Switzerland, Serbia and Cameroon in Group G and are heavy favourites to progress to the round of 16 having won their last seven games in a row, scoring 26 goals in the process. With a provisional price range of \u00a36.5m - \u00a37m, Neymar is one of the most-expensive players in Dream Team World Cup but he is likely to end up a fraction cheaper than the likes of Lionel Messi, Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe when prices are finalised next week. Is 2022 Brazil's year? All eyes on Neymar for the answer."},

Begambleaware.org But it has got me thinking over the last few days about racing and our image in the wider world. After all, our sport has come to rely on billionaires from countries like Qatar, so much so that if they upped and left tomorrow, the sport would collapse quicker than Liz Truss in a head-to-head with a lettuce. We don\u2019t so much as turn a blind eye to it as openly encourage investment from the likes of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The World Cup host nation is a huge player in British racing and has tens of millions worth of sponsorship deals, as well as dozens of racehorses. The Bahrainians are growing in influence and this year the billionaire playboy Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad Al Khalifa won the St Leger, the oldest of the five British Classics, with Eldar Eldarov. And each year when the Saudi Cup rolls around, our top trainers and jockeys willfully bury their heads in the sand and blow smoke up the organisers backsides. Sheikh Mohammed has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in recent years, and if one day he decided to scrap Godolphin, Flat racing would take years to recover. His all-conquering trainer Charlie Appleby, and the now smaller operation of Saeed bin Suroor, employs hundreds of people in Newmarket. And at the Tattersalls Sales last month, the ruler of Dubai spent a whopping \u00a326 million on new stock, more than double anyone else. We\u2019ve become nearly totally reliant on tainted cash. I\u2019d like to think that the widespread and justified criticism of the 2022 World Cup makes racing chiefs break out in a cold sweat, but I doubt it. Is there a way we can buck the trend? No, is the short answer. The sport sold its soul a long time ago and there is no getting it back. Many of racing's high-profile participants, who just happen to be on the payroll of the Sheikhs, say we should shut-up and be grateful for their investment. That doesn\u2019t mean that we - myself included - shouldn't grow something resembling a backbone and at least ask these people some uncomfortable questions.

{"title": "West Ham\u2019s Gianluca Scamacca on idolising Eric Cantona, learning from Mark van Bommel and showing no fear in England", "author": "Jordan Davies", "date": "11 Nov 2022", "content": "MOULDED by Mark van Bommel and Ruud van Nistelrooy, but desperate to become east London\u2019s very own Eric Cantona.  newest frontman Gianluca Scamacca is certainly no shrinking violet, covered in tattoos, blonde highlights in his ruffled brown hair and a stylish slit in his left eyebrow. In his first national interview since  , the Italian is in a jovial mood, reclined on a sofa wearing a hoodie with his shoelaces undone. At just 23 years old in a new country, speaking a second language, he oozes confidence. When asked if he was the best of his age group growing up in his hometown of Rome, playing in the streets, he chuckled. \u201cYes. Why do you ask?\u201d It is pointed out there may have been other good players. He replied: \u201cYeah, but they didn\u2019t follow my path.\u201d That path saw Scamacca leave Roma\u2019s academy for PSV in Holland aged 16, where he worked under legendary Dutch stars Van Bommel Van Nistelrooy. It was a period where he insists he had \u201cno fear\u201d despite his tender age, before returning to Italy in 2017 to make his name in Serie A with the likes of Cremonese, Ascoli and Genoa on loan. Earlier this year, during a season where he scored 16 goals in 36 league games for Sassuolo, Scamacca claimed: \u201cMy way of hitting the ball is a gift from above.\u201d Hardly surprising then that his footballing icon is   maverick and Hollywood big-time Eric Cantona.  As a teenager, Scamacca would trawl through old videos and adverts of the great striker in his 90s era of dominance and delight, searching for inspiration. You get the impression that if West Ham\u2019s kit had a collar, Scamacca would pop it. But he is under no illusion that if he is to emulate the effervescent Frenchman in the Premier League, there is still room for improvement. Scamacca explained: \u201cDefinitely [Cantona] was an influence and he was very imposing, also a little bit arrogant in his way in his approach. \u201cI am still trying to work towards that for myself, trying to be a little more imposing in my physique and also a bit more\u00a0confident\u00a0in games.\u00a0I've got to get that\u00a0confidence. \u201cTo be able to use my physique more, to try to have more of an impact on a physical level. \"In Italy it was different. It's more tactical rather than physical. But here in the Premier League, you need to be more imposing.\u00a0 \u201cIt's a different way of playing. They're faster. Definitely it surprised me and it's something I'm getting used to. I need to get used to it quickly. It's a different type of game.\u201d Scamacca\u2019s start to life in   has been a mixed bag. In the Europa Conference League, he has shone with four goals in seven outings. In the Prem, has found the net just twice. Not that this start will dent his belief of transforming into one of the league\u2019s all-time greats. It is suggested it may take him a few years to reach the levels he wants. Scamacca responded: \u201cA couple of years? No, a couple of months! \u201cI'm at 70 per cent of my potential. In a couple of months, I'll get there, or be on my way there. I know I can do better. \u201cI found confidence on my journey. I had a lot of difficulties in the past. I had to work on myself. On my mind. This made me more confident.\u201d Those difficult moments include an incident in May of last year when   armed with an iron bar, allegedly damaging several cars. Later that year, Scamacca publicly distanced himself from him in an Instagram post, stating: \u201cI grew up with my mother and my sister and they are family for me. No one else.\u201d Asked about the importance of his mother in his career so far, Scamacca said: \u201cShe was important. The mum is always important, she supported me when it was a little difficult. \u201cIf it wasn't for the fact I'm so passionate about football and I love it so much since an early age I wouldn't be here now.\u201d It is the \u2018now\u2019 that Scamacca is focused on. West Ham have the chance to end this period on a high with the visit of Leicester before the  . Ready to watch from home following Italy\u2019s failure to qualify, Scamacca admits to ignoring the standards set by the likes of , Mohamed Salah and   this campaign. He said: \u201cI am not worried about comparisons. This is for other people to do. My main focus is on myself and trying to get to the best level and potential I can give. \"It is not difficult for me. This is my work. This is my passion. I live for that. It is a dream for me. I don\u2019t worry about pressure.\u00a0 \"I don\u2019t worry because I\u2019m far from home. No. I just live for football. It\u2019s enough for me.\" Could there one day be chants of \u201cOoh, Aah, Scamacca\u201d ringing around the London Stadium? Only time will tell."},

Fifa has sunk so low", "author": "Karren Brady", "date": "11 Nov 2022", "content": "THE mistake was, said ex-Fifa president Sepp Blatter with the air of the man who had just found the Mary Celeste, that Qatar was too small for a World Cup.

They left us all with the biggest sporting event after the Olympics to be held in a desert. Old man Blatter\u2019s confession understates the country\u2019s unsuitability with a schoolboy excuse. Too small? It\u2019s also too hot, too prejudiced, too sober, too restricted, too male-orientated, too undemocratic. Readers might wish to add to this list. Now some chap who was once a local footballer \u2014 and incredulously said that homosexuality is \" \" \u2014 asks us all to be kind to Qatar and leave it in peace to get on with hosting. So has Fifa chief  , who by the way moved to Doha a year ago. They are entitled to their opinion, as are we all. Mine is simple. When Qatar launched what was to be its surprisingly successful bid (an obvious choice once the Cayman Islands wasn\u2019t available!) it should have done so in the knowledge that there was going to be a lot of verbal stone-throwing. The guilty parties who voted for Russia and Qatar were not only politically blind but geographically stupid. The original proposal for summer football in Qatar, despite promises of air-conditioned stadiums, was preposterous. When that sank in, the competition dates were changed to November and December, which capsized domestic leagues across the globe. At this point,   should have pulled back and chosen a summer competition in countries where there are already plenty of big stadiums and football is played and watched by millions. My suggestion would have been the UK and the Republic or Ireland, where summers are warm rather than devastatingly hot. We have the infrastructure. Grounds would be full, the welcome generous and tolerant. I am told we have no chance of a successful bid for decades to come but there are a number of European countries who would have been ideal.\u00a0 But no, promises had been made and money paid so it will be played among Doha\u2019s towers, or in outlying deserts among the oil wells and camels. Qatar is insanely rich and constantly looking for ways to spend its oil money. Until the 1960s the Emirates was a British protectorate, now it\u2019s one of the UK\u2019s greatest investors in property. It now owns property which spans more than 1.5 times the area of London\u2019s Hyde Park worth \u00a340BILLION, including The Shard, Harrods and part of the London Stock Exchange. But even if it repaired the Houses of Parliament and rebuilt Hadrian\u2019s Wall, human rights protesters wouldn\u2019t be silenced. Nor should they be. If the media had not reported the deaths of hundreds of stadium workers in Qatar, would anything have been done? We have to doubt it. I am sure the Qataris hoped that hosting the World Cup would put them on the world stage. It certainly has, which is why you must be careful what you wish for."},

{"title": "Inside Qatar\u2019s brutal laws that could see England World Cup fans flogged & jailed just for drinking, photos or swearing", "author": "Katie Davis", "date": "12 Nov 2022", "content": "FOOTBALL fans face being thrown behind bars or flogged over minor offences as they jet out to Qatar for the World Cup. Boozing, swearing, taking photos and even having sex could all land Brits jail sentences thanks to \"vague\" and \"confusing\" laws in the\u00a0 \u00a0Gulf State. Qatar still has capital punishment - and legal medieval punishments include flogging and stoning, although the latter has never been used.  About 1.2million people are expected to travel to   ahead of the tournament kicking off on November 20. Radha Stirling, founder and director of the Detained in Dubai legal aid group, which has launched an app to help   fans facing problems, has warned Brits could end up in trouble for trivial issues. She told The Sun Online: \"Qatar has not experienced mass tourism before this year and it is highly likely visitors will get into trouble, similar to the cases we have seen in Dubai over the past decade. \u00a0 \"It is difficult to advise people to 'obey the law' when the laws are so strict that Qatar is telling police to 'go easy on tourists' during the cup. \"Arbitrary enforcement of the law creates confusion and risk to visitors. \u00a0 \"Like in Dubai, people are often singled out when a complaint is made to police by a local Qatari who has been 'offended' by a visitor. \u00a0 \"The police are then obliged to act on the complaint.\"\u00a0 Visitors could find themselves nicked for public drunkenness even if they have only had a tiny tipple because of the unclear nature of alcohol laws. For example, if a drinker is reported to cops for \"offending\" someone, they would likely be charged with public drunkenness. Guzzling booze in public spaces is also banned and could result in a six-month prison sentence or a hefty fine. Lashes have also been dished out for people found drinking alcohol.  Meanwhile, taking photos without permission, flirting, swearing and arguing could also land footie fans in jail. According to Detained in Dubai, the first person to report behaviour to the police will be taken the most seriously, even if it is completely unfair. In Qatar, same-sex conduct is punishable by up to seven years in jail as it remains an offence under the Penal Code. Qatar\u2019s abysmal human rights record means that abiding by the law does not protect visitors from prosecution or wrongful detention According to Article 296, \"leading, instigating or seducing a male in any way to commit sodomy or dissipation\" and \"inducing or seducing a male or a female in any way to commit illegal or immoral actions\" are crimes. Radha said: \"Sex outside marriage is illegal in Qatar so couples who book hotel rooms together are already in violation of the law, simply \u2018hoping\u2019 the law won\u2019t be enforced. \u00a0 \"Homosexuality is unlawful and those who share a hotel room could be equally at risk. \u00a0 \"Visiting a destination and \u2018hoping\u2019 that illegal acts are not prosecuted puts visitors in a dangerous situation. \u00a0 \"Qatar\u2019s abysmal human rights record means that abiding by the law does not protect visitors from prosecution or wrongful detention. \"Qatar should have been required to update laws to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of visitors expected this year.\" Qatar has also been accused of curtailing freedom of expression by using harsh laws to stifle voices. Protestors at the upcoming World Cup could be slapped with a five-year prison sentence and fines of up to \u00a323,000 for \"stirring up public opinion\". The punishments can be dished out thanks to a vague law passed in 2020, which Amnesty blasted as \"an attack on freedom of expression... (that) could silence peaceful protest.\" It reads: \"Anyone who broadcasts, publishes, or republishes false or biased rumours, statements, or news, or inflammatory propaganda, domestically or abroad, with the intent to harm national interests, stir up public opinion, or infringe on the social system or the public system of the state.\" Meanwhile,   if they report being the victim of a sex attack, lawyers have warned. Figures show soccer stadiums become sex assault hotspots when booze-fuelled crowds flock to big games during tournaments. But thousands of women fans expected to travel to the\u00a0 \u00a0Gulf State in November have been warned they face prosecution if they report offences. \u2019s strict Islamic code outlaws all sexual contact between unmarried couples. This means that even rape victims can be prosecuted for what the state deems as \"having sex\" outside of marriage. Around 100 prosecutions a year have been recorded under the strict \u201czina\u201d laws banning sex and pregnancy outside of marriage. And even rape victims have been prosecuted after suspects claimed sex was consensual - and handed sentences ranging from seven years jail to flogging with a whip or stick. In 2016 a 22-year-old Dutch woman, named only as Laura, was convicted of extra-marital sex, fined \u00a3580 and given a one-year suspended sentence after reporting a brutal rape. She was drugged in a nightclub in Qatar before being sexually assaulted - but was arrested immediately when she reported the incident. Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs insists that it is \"one of the safest countries in the world,\" and that \"everyone is welcome and no one is discriminated against\". Unlike neighbouring Saudi Arabia, women in Qatar have been free to work, drive, and hold public office for decades. And Qatari police and tournament organisers have issued a statement insisting that it will not prosecute drunk football fans or members of the LGBTQ+ community who show affection. The document, as seen by the Dutch publication AD, states that women who report sexual assault or rape do not have to fear getting prosecuted for adultery or extramarital sex. Detained in Dubai has launched a new emergency help app for those travelling out for the World Cup. Radha said: \"We have seen how Qatar overreacted when a British man was arrested for carrying an unused herb grinder or when they violated female passengers onboard a flight to Australia. \u00a0 \"Female rape victims have been jailed for sex outside marriage and local prisons are notorious for human rights violations. \u00a0 \"We have launched an app where people can use the chat function to request urgent help or to receive warning alerts and notifications to keep people out of trouble as much as possible.\" In 2019, Conor Howard, from Scotland, was detained in Doha during a stopover flight between Australia and the UK over a brand new \u00a310 herb grinder that authorities wrongly perceived as a \"cannabis grinder\". He was allowed to return home, but months later while trying to visit his mum in Corfu was arrested by Greek authorities after they were notified of an outstanding warrant issued by Qatar over drug possession allegations. Conor spent around a month in a Greek prison before being released on bail, when a court dropped a case over lack of evidence."},

It came out exactly like this: Thanks to Platini's four votes and his people, the World Cup went to Qatar instead of the USA.

Loftus-Cheek said: \"I went to see Andy train and play at Surbiton in the summer. I'm a big fan of tennis. \"We had a chat and it was good to see how he sees himself and his career and the injuries that hindered him through it.  \"He had a big one with the hip that he still struggles with a bit so it was good to compare careers.\" Loftus-Cheek added: \"I've put a lot of work into the gym and physically to get back to how I'm feeling now, but the tougher side has been the mental side to it.\" The 26-year-old appears to have won over   manager Graham Potter with his progress. In fact,   insists England boss Gareth Southgate should seriously consider calling him up for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. \n The Blues boss said: \"He has really impressed me, Ruben, on and off the pitch. \"He is fantastic on the ball, great physicality, great athlete.  \"I think he is putting himself in a situation where he will be one of the players Gareth will be looking at as an outsider for the squad.

And that means they will never have their hands on the trophy if their teams fall short over the next couple of months. For others the upcoming tournament simply presents a chance at a final farewell to the competition, with many World Cup veterans set to feature. Here, SunSport takes a look at an XI of the oldest players who could take to the pitch in Qatar. Kawashima, 39, plays for Ligue Un side Strasbourg and has won 95 caps for Japan. The goalkeeper is set to feature in his fourth World Cup next month and will be aiming to make it past the second round for the first time. The Barcelona and Brazil legend, 39, is hoping to get a call up after being left out of the most recent national team squad in September. Brazil boss Tite could be keen to have Alves' experience and influence in his dressing room with the right-back boasting 125 caps. Another Brazilian colossus, Silva still plays regularly for club and country and has shown good form for   in recent weeks. The 39-year-old has featured in three World Cups and famously was suspended for Brazil's embarrassing 7-1 defeat semi-final to Germany on home soil in 2014. A World Cup winner, the Paris Saint-Germain centre-back is now in his twilight years aged 36. He has won an astonishing 180 caps and despite a 20-month exile from the national team after a disappointing move to PSG,  Once part of the Belgian golden generation, former Tottenham defender Vertonghen could feature at centre-back or left-back for the Red Devils. Vertonghen, 35, helped Belgium to a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup after beating England in the third-place play-off. The Mexico legend, 36, will get one last hurrah in Qatar after confirming he will retire at the end of the tournament, having represented his country 177 times. He is captain of El Tri and will hope his guile and experience sends his side through a group consisting of Argentina, Poland and Saudi Arabia. Modric was a star of the Russia World Cup and despite being 37 years old he shows no sign of slowing down any time soon. He played a key role for   in their LaLiga and Champions league double last season and could help Croatia defy the odds odds once again in Qatar. Once of Fulham fame, Bryan Ruiz now plays on home soil for Costa Rican top tier side LD Alajuelense. The 37-year-old is more of a bit part player for Costa Rica these days and will likely have low expectations in a group containing Germany, Spain and Japan. The   star has been   heading into the tournament but would love to silence the critics - just as he did at Euro 2016. Ronaldo, 37, has lost his mojo this season but with Portugal considered a dark horse he could make his final World Cup one to remember. The Uruguay striker has tremendous World Cup pedigree having helped his team reach the semi-final in 2010 after handballing on the line against Ghana. He then helped to knock out England in the group stages in 2014 and although he is now 35, he has rediscovered his form for Nacional and would love to bow out of the international stage with a bang. Giroud, 36, helped France win the World Cup in 2018 and could play a similarly valuable role for Didier Deschamps' side this time around. The AC Milan striker is battling to get into a France attack with Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbappe also in the squad."},

Don\u2019t say  bosses didn\u2019t ask for it, because they did. The moment the highly questionable executive committee voted for Russia and   to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, horrified activists began campaigns for change. There was plenty to campaign about, too. Russian sport is riddled with drugs crime and Vladimir Putin\u2019s policies are accelerating towards tyranny. After questions about where exactly Qatar is, it also became clear oil money was its lifeblood and that its rulers cared as much about stadium workers\u2019 welfare as women\u2019s rights. So, not much at all. No less than 650 men are believed to have died constructing stadiums.  And although worldwide protests have helped improve pay and conditions, we still have the feeling foreign brickies in the Arab state were ranked just above slaves. With the   three weeks away, it is probably too late to do much about the latest challenges \u2014 but it is surely right to air them. Such is the anger at , that a side issue concerning Iran\u2019s sale of bomb-charged drones to Russia has angered protesters to the point of demanding the replacement of the Islamic republic\u2019s team with Ukraine. For all sorts of reasons, this isn\u2019t going to happen.  Much as many people may see it as justice, it would be an open goal to barring many countries from numerous international competitions. The idea of a World Cup of the Innocents might be fun for those nations without fault, although my guess is such total purity does not exist anywhere or in anyone. Iceland might edge in on the basis of lowest crime rate, although not judging by the number of wicked whodunits on TV recently. An Iceland v Tonga final may not be a big attraction... Sadly, Ukraine will have to concentrate on matters closer to home. I have more sympathy with the bid to oust Iran, through the shocking treatment of protesters who refuse to accept their government\u2019s refusal to do anything about the brutal murder, in police custody, of Mahsa Amini for taking off her hijab. Many since \u2014 including women and children \u2014 have been killed demanding women\u2019s rights. Again, barring the Iran team would be widely applauded. But I am far from sure that it would further those demands.  There is a scant record of boycott success in sport. Olympic boycotts haven\u2019t worked and, realistically, the only one that did was against apartheid, which was started by England\u2019s cancellation of the 1968-69 cricket Test series against South Africa. One promise we can make is that boycott campaigns will continue to flourish. Protesters have found it hard to impress themselves on football but I fear it won\u2019t be too long before the green movement, for one, concentrates on the biggest sport there is. We should be careful how we treat people who want change for the better. Improving human rights has to be one of those.  Racism and undervaluing women are the most blatant and, I\u2019m afraid, many politicians are slow in acting to improve these. Football is huge across the world and has the muscle to boot their reluctance over the grandstand."},

Around 85 per cent of Qatar's three million population are foreign workers.  Many of those evicted work as drivers, day labourers or have contracts with companies but are responsible for their own accommodation - unlike those working for major construction firms who live in camps housing tens of thousands of people. One worker said the evictions targeted single men, while foreign workers with families were unaffected. Some buildings had their electricity switched off. The Qatari official said municipal authorities have been enforcing a 2010 Qatari law which prohibits \"workers' camps within family residential areas\" - a designation encompassing most of central Doha - and gives them the power to move people out. Some of the evicted workers said they hoped to find places to live amid purpose-built workers' accommodation in and around the industrial zone on Doha's southwestern outskirts or in outlying cities, a long commute from their jobs. The evictions \"keep Qatar's glitzy and wealthy facade in place without publicly acknowledging the cheap labour that makes it possible,\" said Vani Saraswathi, Director of Projects at Migrant-Rights.org, which campaigns for foreign workers in the Middle East. \"This is deliberate ghetto-isation at the best of times.

With the first goal, I was going to take it first time but I rolled it to my left before I hit it and I was gutted when the keeper saved it. \u201cBut my eyes lit up when it came back to me and it went bang into the top corner. \u201cThe second one I was just busting a gut to get into the box and I just placed it into the corner. \u201cMy only other Premier League goal came behind closed doors against Liverpool and I\u2019ve been waiting so patiently for this moment.\u00a0 \u201cThere have been times when I felt as though it wasn\u2019t going to come but I always believed in myself and now I\u2019m really just overwhelmed by the occasion. \u201cThese goals have given me all the confidence in the world and now I have to keep going as hard as I can if I get another opportunity to help the team.\u201d"},

Under current Three Lions boss  , he has picked his teams based on a mixture of reputation and merit. For example, England midfield mainstay   made his England debut before turning out for the first time in the  . The now Manchester City ace joined a small club of players to play for their country while playing below the top flight.  But such risks haven't always paid off, with a number of footie stars failing to make an impact on the international stage. Some England aces have a handful of caps, or less, to their name. That shouldn't take away from their tremendous achievement, though. Nonetheless, they fall into the category of England players you may have forgot turned out for their country. SunSport takes a look at an XI of forgotten Three Lions stars with the   around the corner. The Southampton goalkeeper has always been regarded as one of the Prem's consistent shot-stoppers. And it was at the South Coast club where McCarthy earned his first England cap.  McCarthy's debut came in 2018 in the 3-0 win over the USA, playing 45 minutes. However, his chances of claiming more caps are slim with the likes of Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope and Dean Henderson all ahead of him in the pecking order. Utility man Ainsley Maitland-Niles played for England five times.  The ex-Arsenal, now Southampton ace, made his Three Lions debut in 2020 in the Nations League against Denmark. England lost the game and Maitland-Niles played just 36 minutes. Brighton's Lewis Dunk is the only man on this list who's close to a return to the England set-up. The centre-back is a mainstay in the Seagulls team and is in Southgate's 55-man pool of players to choose from for the upcoming Qatar World Cup. Dunk's one and only cap for his country came in 2018 against the USA, where he started and kept a clean sheet in the 3-0 win. Not many can say they scored on their England debut. Steven Caulker can. The ex-Tottenham, QPR, Southampton and Liverpool defender made his debut in 2012. He scored in the 4-2 loss to Sweden - a game which saw icon Zlatan Ibrahimovic score all four goals, including an outrageous overhead-kick from distance. Caulker never played for England again. Another player who played for England just once. Jon Flanagan rose through the ranks at Liverpool and gained international recognition in 2014. The now-retired star could play at both right-back and left-back. He played against Ecuador in a 2-2 draw, playing 27 minutes in total. Midfield lynchpin Jack Cork earned his first cap after switching from Swansea to Burnley. Cork played four minutes in the 0-0 draw with Germany in 2017. He now plays in the Championship and is still turning out for Burnley, where he is the club captain.  A once up-and-coming midfielder. Lewis Cook's career got off to a flyer at Leeds before earning a big money move to AFC Bournemouth.  It was at the South Coast club where he made his debut for England.  He played 20 minutes in a 1-1 draw with Italy in 2018. Cook, now 25, is a regular for Bournemouth in the top flight. Chelsea had high hopes for Nathaniel Chalobah. But the midfielder failed to live up to expectations and spent most of his professional career on loan in England and in Italy. Chalobah did manage to earn an England call-up while playing for Watford, though. His only senior cap came in the 3-2 win against Spain in 2018. However, he only managed a minute on the pitch.  Younger brother Trevoh is enjoying greater success at Chelsea. Although, he is yet to play for England.  Known for his blistering speed, Matt Jarvis earned rave reviews at Gillingham before tearing it up at Wolves. It was at the Midlands club where he was handed his England debut against Ghana in 2011. He then went on to join West Ham in 2012, but he struggled to live up to price tags. Jarvis then had a number of loan spells before dropping down the divisions and retiring in 2021. The most accomplished of the \"forgotten\" team. Andros Townsend made his England debut in 2013, where he scored in the 4-1 win over Montenegro.  Ex-Tottenham ace Townsend went on to play a further 12 times for the Three Lions, adding another two goals to the one he scored on his debut. He is at Everton, however, his contract is due to expire next summer.  Dominic Solanke won't have given up on an England career, to be clear. The striker is still just 25 years old.  Solanke was handed an England debut in 2017 in a draw with Brazil. He was called up after switching Chelsea for Liverpool. A call-up which could be put down to his predicted carer trajectory."},

Same-sex relationships remain illegal in the state and homosexuality can be punishable by death.

So is everybody excited? No? Me neither. Just 19 days to go until the greatest sporting show on Earth and the absence of   fever is striking. If anybody is truly up for the tournament in Qatar, then I haven\u2019t met them. Many of the reasons are well-rehearsed \u2014 the corruption of the voting process, the   of the Qatari regime, the deaths of thousands of migrant workers involved in the construction of\u00a0 stadiums, the fact that LGBT people and unmarried couples are unwelcome. Then there\u2019s the unsuitability of a tiny nation hosting such a huge event \u2014 the lack of affordable hotel rooms, as well as \u00a315 pints \u2014 if you can find a beer at all. But even if you\u2019re fortunate enough not to be going to Qatar, there is a marked lack of enthusiasm. This weekend, I attended two Premier League matches and heard many supporters groaning about the imposition of a seven-week break in the middle of the domestic season. That was aside from the  , giving England a World Cup scare \u2014 a reminder that the crammed schedule means many players finding relatively minor injuries robbing them of career-defining moments. Physically and mentally, players are struggling to be ready for what should be the pinnacle of the sport. For supporters, too, summers are for major tournaments and winters are for the regular matchday rituals of watching your football club home and away. Nobody wants a World Cup shoehorned into November and December. And remember this, when Fifa\u2019s sleaze-ridden bosses voted for Qatar it was sold under the lie of a summer tournament. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to cover five World Cups \u2014 and have considered these tournaments not just as career highlights but also as life-affirming experiences. I\u2019ve looked forward to every previous tournament but not this one. Nor is any other journalist I\u2019ve spoken to. Of course, none of us want or expect you to play us sympathetic tunes on tiny violins. But several supporters I know who have regularly attended World Cups and European Championships \u2014 to\u00a0 follow England and also to enjoy matches as neutrals \u2014 have never even considered going to Qatar. Too expensive, too joyless, just not a \u2018proper\u2019 World Cup at all. And those who would have been watching from the UK anyway, will not be able to enjoy all the usual communal beer-garden rituals, as the temperatures plunge. Aside from the magnitude of the actual sport, attending a World Cup usually feels like you\u2019re part of a global melting pot, a carnival of humanity. Too expensive, too joyless, just not a \u2018proper\u2019 World Cup at all. It\u2019s bloody good fun. While I\u2019ve covered some extraordinary matches at those five tournaments, football is only part of the experience. My first World Cup was spent in South Korea, based in the party district of Itaewon \u2014 the scene of the horrific tragedy which saw 154 people crushed to death this weekend. Back in 2002, that was a hedonistic place, supporters from dozens of nations thrown together for a month-long fiesta. Not least because the host nation was gripped by mania as their team enjoyed a shock run to the semi-finals. South Korea\u2019s matches still rank as the noisiest I\u2019ve ever attended. The street parties which followed, the most ecstatic. And in the southern port city of Busan, we drank until dawn and ate octopus curry in a fish market in an attempt to sober up. This was the life. Four years later, there were Munich\u2019s beer gardens in a blazing-hot German summer, as England\u2019s WAGs stole the show up in Baden-Baden. In 2010, the first African World Cup, visits to Soweto and the glories of Cape Town (where Fabio Capello\u2019s England stank the place out). Then in 2014, it was kickabouts on Copacabana beach in Rio, as the home of the \u2018Beautiful Game\u2019 played host and   went out in five days. Just be glad that you\u2019re not going. And Russia. Despite its dreadful leader, what a wonderful nation. St Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities on Earth. Moscow, with its grand architecture, even the subway stations like art galleries. In unsung Nizhny Novgorod, there was craft ale and congas and karaoke. And nobody who went to Russia in 2018 will ever forget the Peruvians \u2014 determined to make the most of their nation having qualified for the first time since 1982. You simply could not move for Peruvians, in every street and every bar, in every host city \u2014 and long after Peru had been knocked out. Qatar will bring none of those joys. Of course, corruption and human-rights issues will rightly grab most of the negative headlines. But one of the worst things about this World Cup will be the lack of freedom to have authentic, impromptu, unrestrained fun. Just be glad that you\u2019re not going. Some of that had to do with timing \u2014 Emery\u2019s Villarreal were enjoying a run to the Champions League semi-finals last term. But still, for a\u00a0 manager with such a fine European pedigree \u2014 winning four Europa Leagues at Sevilla and Villarreal \u2014 to accept a job where there is\u00a0 little hope of even\u00a0 qualifying for Europe seems strange. With Newcastle having turned England\u2019s Big Six into a Big Seven, it will take a minor miracle for Emery\u2019s Villa to even qualify for the Europa Conference League during the length of his three-and-a-half-year contract at Villa Park. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men have played in three European Cup finals in the 5\u00bd years since. Given that home advantage ceased to exist during the pandemic behind-closed-doors era, when Liverpool lost six in a row at Anfield, that stat is a meaningful one. But having failed to win an away match in the league this season and with their Kop fortress having now been stormed, Klopp\u2019s glorious Liverpool reign is officially on the slide. But perhaps even more remarkable is Marco Silva\u2019s ability to revive a 34-year-old Willian. The Brazilian looked like an overweight has-been at Arsenal a couple of years ago but is now dominating top-flight matches for Fulham. Apparently this occurred because of political wranglings over the governing body. Which is a shame, because I\u2019d hoped for a Greek president with an irrational hatred of Eddie Waring\u2019s commentary who had outlawed rugby league on a bizarre personal whim. Southgate may not be fashionable right now. But, unlike Potter, he doesn\u2019t think Three Lions ace Raheem Sterling is a wing-back. Because whatever Big Sam failed to achieve in management, it was never down to a lack of self-belief or an ability to blow his own trumpet."},

And now, Ukraine\u2019s Association of Football has demanded that  due to its reported  for Vladimir  in his illegal war on their people, and also cited Iran\u2019s \"systematic human rights violations\" including a brutal crackdown on domestic protests. So, there\u2019s a lot of high moral outrage flying around, and there will be a lot of on-field halos glinting in the ferocious Qatar heat come November 20  . But I can\u2019t be the only one wishing we could just keep all the politics and virtue-signalling out of it so we can just enjoy the football? The time for proper serious debate about Qatar\u2019s suitability to host the tournament was surely  , not three weeks before it starts? And if the argument against them running it is that they have a poor human rights record, which is an undeniable fact, then what about the other 31 countries taking part? Specifically, if persecution of gay people is deemed a disqualifying barrier to being involved in the World Cup, then shouldn\u2019t we be similarly outraged by the participation of Senegal, Morocco and Tunisia where it\u2019s also illegal to be homosexual? Or by Ghana, whose parliament is pushing through a new bill demanding prison sentences for anyone even expressing support or \u201csympathy\u201d towards gay people? Or by Cameroon which according to a recent report \"currently prosecutes consensual same sex conduct more aggressively than almost any country in the world\u201d? And don\u2019t get me started on  , where if you\u2019re caught in a gay act, you can be chemically castrated, given life imprisonment or even executed. A closer look at other World Cup nations reveals further distinctly \u2018problematic\u2019 human rights issues. Costa Rica has serious human trafficking problems,  has shocking levels of unlawful police killings and torture, Argentina is bedevilled by government and judiciary corruption, and Serbia continues to oppress Roma gypsies. Many of the countries already mentioned operate ongoing wars on free speech, jailing dissident citizens and journalists who criticise the government \u2013 or, in Saudi Arabia\u2019s case, - and also have terrible records of mistreating migrant workers. \u00a0 And if modern morality failings are truly our new World Cup qualification byword, then why should either England or  be allowed to play given our invasion of Iraq in 2003 and all the subsequent global terrorism hell that illegal war unleashed on the world? You get my point\u2026 Once you play the morality card in sport, I\u2019m not sure where you can ever end up playing it without appearing to endorse human rights abuses. To single out Qatar for such exaggerated horror when so many other competing countries are just as morally bad, if not a lot worse, is hypocritical. We\u2019ve witnessed similar double standards in golf where leaders of the   have berated the new for putting money before morals \u2013 despite they themselves hosting events in places like  which has a horrendous human rights record. \u00a0And frankly, as a sports fan, I\u2019m sick of all the disingenuousness. If footballers are really that offended by Qatar\u2019s human rights failings, then they shouldn\u2019t go and play in the World Cup. It\u2019s all very well wearing armbands or issuing critical videos, but if you still go then you\u2019re just dabbling in pointless virtue-signalling that will have zero impact on effecting any change. I feel the same way about all the sports journalists suddenly jumping on the anti-Qatar bandwagon and saying it shouldn\u2019t be happening. You can bet your life most of them will be holding their indignant noses long enough to get on a plane to Doha for six weeks as they cover the event they are pretending to want cancelled. I\u2019ll be there too for some of it, as a pundit for Fox in America during the group stage which has pitted England against the US. And I feel no moral dilemma about going because I understand that many of the countries playing in this World Cup make Qatar look almost benign by comparison when it comes to human rights. That doesn\u2019t excuse Qatar\u2019s problems, but it puts them into perspective. I also think it\u2019s crazy that this is the first time the World Cup has ever been staged in the Middle East given the huge popularity of football in the region, and we should celebrate that fact, not ruin the party with very selective judgement. So, my message to the morality moaners is this: put your cracked halos away and just let me watch the bloody World Cup without trying to make me feel shameful or guilty about it.

They were both taken to a police station, where they were fined 300 Qatari Rial (around \u00a374). The victim says he was then deported after spending a night in a jail cell.

Everyone who has signed up for the scheme in Qatar is guaranteed a ticket to the opening ceremony but must stay in the country for at least two weeks. They will be sat in groups and told to sing at appropriate times for the television cameras.

At best they're volunteers for the World Cup and at worst they're a mouthpiece for the Supreme Committee Hemmingham, 59, appeared on Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy panel at a recent fans' forum hosted by the England Supporters Travel Club at Wembley Stadium. There, he told the audience about his positive experience during a recent trip to Doha. \"Qatar is very safe, there are lots of rules and no crime,\" he said. Last year, it was reported by The Guardian that more than 6,500 migrant labourers died during the construction of the World Cup facilities. Meanwhile, homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, and under the country's Sharia law, a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's. The Sun Online has approached Hemmingham and the England Band as well as The FA for comment. An FA spokesperson said:  The Qatar Supreme Committee approached the England Supporters Travel Club to run a registration process for fans to join the World Cup \u2018Fan Leaders\u2019 Forum. \"We were told this was an opportunity to engage with fans from all competing nations to ensure that the voice of supporters was clearly heard in the planning for the World Cup and that many international football associations were being approached. \"Following the initial registration process, the project has been managed by the Qatar Supreme Committee, and we have had no more involvement with the scheme, and no sight of the 'code of conduct' or any of the terms and conditions of involvement.\" Qatar is desperate to present a positive image of itself during the flagship tournament and has paid David Beckham millions to act as an ambassador for the hosts. In March last year, Qatar's Supreme Committee, which is organising the World Cup, approached the FA asking for members of the official supporters' club to join a fan engagement forum. Originally, it was believed that the scheme was simply a chance for a free trip to Qatar as well as complimentary flights, tickets, and accommodation for the tournament itself, in return for spreading information to other fans. But it is understood that in September, those approached were asked to sign up to a \"code of conduct\" to guarantee their all-expenses-paid trip to the tournament. \"It all sounds a bit sinister and distasteful,\" said one leading member of a fan group - who asked not to be named. The scheme has not been endorsed by either the   Supporters' Association or the FA. Qatar has defended the scheme. Ahsan Mansoor, the fan engagement director for the World Cup, who also attended the recent forum at Wembley, insisted that \"there is no obligation to promote or do anything\". The country claims it has enlisted some 20,000 volunteers from around the world to help, working at hotels, hospitals, and airports, as well as in the stadiums themselves. But Ronan Evain, executive director of Football Supporters Europe, slammed the move, as well as any fans groups who signed up for it. \"At best they're volunteers for the World Cup and at worst they're a mouthpiece for the Supreme Committee,\" he said. The Sun Online has approached the World Cup's Supreme Committee in Qatar for comment. And football's international governing body FIFA - which was roundly criticised by human rights groups for awarding the tournament to Qatar - has also begged supporters to concentrate on football. , stressing that \"everyone will be welcome\" in Qatar.

Kolo Muani scored a 72nd-minute winner for the visitors. Arthur Gomes had put the hosts ahead in the 39th and Frankfurt equalized with a penalty kick converted by Daichi Kamada in the 62nd. Sporting was leading Group D while it was winning at home, but it ended in third place and with a spot in the Europa League playoffs.  A draw would have been enough for it to advance regardless of other results. The Portuguese side were trying to make it to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the second straight season.  They were eliminated by Manchester City in the last 16 last season. Sporting started the game one point behind Tottenham, which scored late to win 2-1 at Marseille and finish first in what had been a wide-open Group D entering the last round. Marseille ended in last place. Sporting lost forward Nuno Santos because of an injury in the first half. Santos was in a preliminary 55-man squad for Portugal ahead of the Qatar World Cup. Sporting's 17-year-old midfielder Dario Essugo made his Champions League debut in the second half.  (Ts&Cs apply) That is all for SunSport's coverage of\u00a0Sporting 1-2 Frankfurt. It was a great game, which had it all, including a Kolo Muani stunner, and a comeback from the away side that looked highly unlikely going into half time at the bottom of the group. That win sees Spurs remain at the top of their group, with Frankfurt in second, Sporting in third and Marseille at the bottom.  In the other game in this group, it was   to put the Lilywhites in the driving seat.  Thank you as always for reading, we hope you enjoyed, and have a great night! Frankfurt were resilient tonight, if you were to sum up their performance in one word, it would be that.  And no man on the pitch personified that as well as Sebastian Rode, who was substituted into the game at half time.  The ex-Bayern and Dortmund midfielder really showed his class, in an industrious, hard working performance, that showed every inch of technical nous required to compete at the top of the game.  There were a few brilliant performances, but his was the most complete, so he takes the SunSport man of the match award.  \n This is how the group ended after a spectacular night of football in Group D.  This is why we love the Champions League, how quickly it can change, how emotions can turn from elation to deflation in a matter of minutes.  At half-time Sporting were top of the group, and Frankfurt were bottom.  With seconds to go, Sporting were heading out of Europe, and Marseille were playing Europa League.  But all of those things changed, in what was a gripping Tuesday night in Europe's premier competition.  Well, well well... Everyone thought Frankfurt had done it and finished top of the group.  *Enter Pierre Emile Hojbjerg* The Danish midfielder has scored the winner for Spurs in the 94th minute against Marseille! It was some finish, that now sees Spurs top the group, with Frankfurt in second. Sporting now go into the Europa League places after being down and out at full time, with Marseille dropping out of Europe completely! Frankfurt have done it! They stay in the Champions League! So close from the corner! Sporting still believe and they have another corner! The keeper is coming up and Inacio gets a yellow card... Sporting have won a corner at the death... There will be four minutes of added time.  Alidou is coming on for Eintracht Frankfurt, he will replace Mario Gotze. Knauff does really well on the right hand side defensively for Frankfurt, after some bright work from Trincao.  This is far from over... Kamada has a chance to seal the victory for Frankfurt, but Adan makes a crucial save.  It would have ruled out for offside regardless.  Sporting are really looking to grab an equaliser here, and there seems to be a bad challenge on one of their players on the edge of the box, but the referee gives no foul and there is no VAR check. This is how the group looks after Frankfurt took the lead... At half time, Sporting were top and Frankfurt were bottom. \"Well, well, well how the turn tables...\" Jakic is lucky to escape a red card there, as he brings down Trincao already on a yellow card.  The free-kick is whipped in, but no Sporting players can win it.  The home side really need to come forwards now, and they make an attacking change as St. Juste comes off for Cabral.  So as it stands now it is Frankfurt who are top of the group! There could well be more excitement to come here... A great goal that, from the Frenchman Kolo Muani! Knauff plays the ball through to Kolo Muani who still has a lot to do, but he does it expertly, as he chests the ball down and smashes a volley on the outside of his right boot into the left hand corner.  Fantastic goal. Frankfurt have the lead! It's a sensational volley from Kolo Muani! Almost a second for Frankfurt, who are really putting the home side under immense pressure now.  Kamada and Rode are really causing problems for Sporting... Another change for Frankfurt, as Knauff comes on for Ebimbe on the right hand side as they seek a second.  Gotze whips a great free-kick into Kolo Muani, but Adan makes the save.  Mario Gotze whips a corner in for Frankfurt, but it comes to nothing.  Keep an eye on Gotze towards the end of this game, everyone knows he has a knack for being a match-winner... It looks like Frankfurt are really in the ascendancy here, as they look to get a second goal that will see them go to the top of the group.  Sporting need to get their heads together and try to build again, just to get a grip on the game once more.  So in a minute's time, Marseille have gone from top of the group, to bottom of the group...  First it was Tottenham who equalised through Lenglet, before Kamada scored from the spot to level for Frankfurt.  This is how the table is looking now... A huge change from Amorim for Sporting as Dario Essugo is thrown into the mix, he is a 17-year-old with just ONE league appearance.  Trincao is also on for Sporting here.  And he does! Daichi Kamada levels for Frankfurt from the spot! Incredible composure and penalty from the Japanese midfielder!"},

But it includes the line: \u201cEveryone is welcome regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or nationality.\u201d Infantino, 52, took over as president in 2016, six years after Qatar were controversially handed the World Cup ahead of both the United States and Australia.

The English FA have been criticised for not being vocal enough over the issues in Qatar.  The Australian national team won plaudits after speaking collectively over human rights in Qatar. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp claims it is not fair that the current players should be expected to speak out over Qatar, stressing the decision to award the nation the World Cup was made over 10 years ago."},

It appears the team is on a gentle downward curve, perhaps because too many of the squad that did so well in the European Championship last year have slipped into exhausted form or spent too many hours in the treatment room. Or maybe because there is so little break between the Prem ending mid-season and the tournament starting that players who are carrying injuries cannot travel. Why, oh why did Fifa give Qatar the  ? Well... we know why, don\u2019t we? But despite all the issues, it seems the team doesn\u2019t sing any more. Southgate is a cautious manager and he has more reasons to be so than at any time in his six-year tenure. Things don\u2019t knit so tidily these days. For one reason or another,  , Kalvin Phillips, Kyle Walker, Raheem Sterling and   are below their best, not surprising in the case of Phillips because injury has limited him since he joined Manchester City. His knotty aggression would be badly missed. Some little miracle will have to work for England even to reach the semi-finals, which the bookies suggest they should. Football coming home? More like partying in Rio or Paris, I\u2019d guess. So our fans will have to be satisfied with the Premier League, the lucky dogs. I say that because their likely disappointments of Doha will soon be no more than regrets at what (just) might have been, once the Prem returns. Yes, it\u2019s true that I love the competition. Not all of it, what with VAR, with players littering the pitch because something hurts a little and with handball rules no one can quite understand. Even with those reasons \u2014 and fill in the space for half-dozen others \u2014 English football is unbeatable entertainment. It\u2019s simply the best league in the world. Rich men and Hollywood stars have discovered this, so have oil sheikhs and Americans. Oil-financed football is not completely my favourite for the future of the top-level game because vast money is beginning to warp it. Buy a club, grab the best manager going and suddenly your team \u2014 lucky old you \u2014 are among the leaders. It happened to  , who appointed the best boss on earth, Pep Guardiola, and garlanded him with almost anything he wanted. This is not jealousy in Claret and Blue writing, instead of grumbling, the tut-titters, I feel we ought to be cheering all of the Premier League teams along. The Government could learn from the way the Prem is conducted. It proves that a trickle-down policy can work. Whether the EFL like it or not, a heap of money is already being passed through English football and, guess what, it works. The Championship is a first-class competition with the seventh-highest attendance figure in the game. Buy a club, grab the best manager going and suddenly your team \u2014 lucky old you \u2014 are among the leaders. But while the EFL are fixated about the cliff edge from the 20th professional club in the country and the rest, there is already a bigger drop forming in the Prem, between sixth and the rest. The Uefa Champions League money, which pays out an average of \u00a360million, looks set to grow by 50 per cent. This doesn\u2019t even take into account the additional revenue these clubs earn from sponsorship, retail and so on. The sponsorship revenue of   is greater than the entire turnover of Aston Villa. The result is that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to compete with the spending power of the top six and the gap is growing. It should come as no surprise that half of the top ten highest-paid players in the Premier League play for Man City. And the best-paid player in the Prem -   (\u00a327m a year) - earned \u00a39m more than the   of Nottingham Forest last year (\u00a318m). It\u2019s bonkers when you look at it like that. Our game thrives on competition, so maybe there should be some calls for addressing this problem \u2013 improved control of the amount Premier clubs spend on transfers, either levelling up or down. Otherwise the top six will never be challenged in the league, something I guess they wanted to achieve with their disastrous closed shop European Super League farce."},
{"title": "Labour\u2019s bigots don\u2019t get it: Tories are the diversity party", "author": "Rod Liddle", "date": "26 Oct 2022", "content": "NO sooner had Rishi Sunak taken office as our new Prime Minister than the Labour squad of perpetual victims were on his back, whining with spite. Step up  , then. The hard-left MP, a big fan of Magic Grandpa, tweeted that   victory \u201cisn\u2019t win for Asian representation\u201d. Privately educated Whittome thinks people are only properly Asian if they share her views, you see. She wasn\u2019t the only one. Zarah Sultana MP, another Leftie, attacked Sunak because he has lots of money. Asians being in power doesn\u2019t make things better for Asians, was the gist of her bleating. She described Rishi as a \u201cfraud\u201d. It has hit a nerve with Labour that our Prime Minister, a  , is the first Hindu to achieve this country\u2019s highest office of state. The first person of colour to become Prime Minister, too. But then, the Conservatives have been leading the way on diversity. They gave the country the first female Prime Minister \u2014 and the second and third, although the less said about them the better. The first Asian Chancellor. The first black Chancellor \u2014 who wasn\u2019t much cop, as it turned out, but never mind. And now the first Prime Minister of colour. In fact, the top of the Conservative Party has long been full of women and people from ethnic minorities. The Tories have a level of diversity in their party that   could only dream of. Some of them are well off, like Rishi Sunak. Others, such as  , are from far less well-off back-grounds. Truly diverse, then. But they all share one important thing. None of them are obsessed with race. None of them believe they are victims of a racist state. None of them spend their entire lives shrieking about how awful it is to be born with skin that is not white. Our black and ethnic-minority communities are waking up to the con job done on them every election time by the Labour Party. Labour insists anyone who isn\u2019t white is a victim and oppressed. It\u2019s the same mantra you hear from the ludicrous   movement. They do this out of self interest. If they keep perpetuating the myth that Britain is racist and only the Labour Party can help people of colour, then people of colour are bound to vote for them. And it then follows that if someone of colour DOESN\u2019T support Labour, they can\u2019t really be properly black or brown themselves. This is the very essence of racism. Another godawful Labour MP, Rupa Huq, once said this very thing about the Conservative MP  He is only \u201csuperficially\u201d black, she insisted. What a narrow, bigoted and loathsome point of view. Labour leader   rightly suspended Huq from the party. So far, however, there has been no apology from nasty, deluded Nadia Whittome, still less from Zarah Sultana. At Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Sir Keir gave a generous welcome to Rishi Sunak. He was very proud, he said, to be part of a country where such a thing could happen. Well said, Sir Keir. Now try to get the message through to all those in your own party who clearly think differently. I SUPPOSE it\u2019s no good moaning that   should keep his nose out of political affairs. And then praising him when he says something really sensible. But while visiting Bangor University, he said: \u201cI still think the great tragedy is the lack of vocational education in schools \u2014 actually, not everybody is designed for the academic.\u201d Dead right, Chas. Including, of course, your good self. But still, a point well made. WHAT a pleasure it was to see the look of fury on   face. She exited 10 Downing Street having been given a ropey job, and looked like Larry the Downing Street cat had just crapped in her handbag. New PM Rishi Sunak has just about got the balance right in the Cabinet, I think. I would have preferred Kemi Badenoch \u2013 Trade Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities \u2013 at Education or Culture. But it\u2019s a small quibble. Now, if only the MPs can put their stupid, vaulting personal ambitions to one side, maybe they\u2019ll give multi-millionaire Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer a run for his money. THE   skipper   should wear a rainbow-coloured One Love armband during the football World Cup in  . This would show the England team\u2019s distress at the lack of , apparently. No, it wouldn\u2019t. Boycotting the tournament would do that. Not more virtue-signalling. Still, at least our boys will be coming home pretty sharpish. HERO of the week is Rosie Duffield, the Labour MP for  . She has said she would rather be arrested than refer to Eddie Izzard, below, as a \u201cwoman\u201d. It takes a lot of courage for any public figure to say something like that. But for a public figure who is also a member of the Labour Party, it is remarkable. THE dirtiest man in the world is dead. And it\u2019s a lesson to all the meddlesome health bullies out there. Amou Haji lived in a village in  . He never washed and he was perfectly happy. He sometimes smoked five cigarettes at once. And when he couldn\u2019t get fags he smoked dried out cow s**t in a pipe. He was contented \u2013 and 94 years old. Then his neighbours decided he needed a bath. And they dragged him to a bathroom. Now he\u2019s not contented \u2013 he\u2019s dead. So listen, leave us alone to live the life we want. If I want to have a shower once a year \u2013 on Walpurgis Night \u2013 and eat fish and chips in bed, using my belly button to store the salt, that\u2019s my look out. IF you were to calculate the odds for the coincidence of two undersea cables to Shetland being severed inside a week, I suspect you would be disinclined to believe it was a coincidence. Just saying NEAR the top of Rishi Sunak\u2019s agenda will be housing. We have a crisis. Obviously we need to build more houses. But there\u2019s one thing Rishi can do that will cost absolutely nothing. Make it easier for people to become private landlords. The Government stupidly clobbered private landlords in the summer, with proposals to make it harder for them to evict tenants, raise rents and refuse ne\u2019er do wells, etc. As a result, thousands have fled from the buy-to-let market. And are Airbnb-ing their properties. Make it easier for people to let their properties, you\u2019ll ease the housing crisis. And annoy the Lefties. Win-win. EVIDENCE grows that the supposed badduns of Hogwarts are really the good guys. Last week I told you about Draco Malfoy coming to the aid of Harry Potter author  . She\u2019s been attacked for her perfectly sensible comments on transgender stuff but Draco actor Tom Felton stuck up for her. Now Lord Voldemort himself has waded into the row \u2013 actor Ralph Fiennes said he was appalled at the abuse received by Rowling. And added that he knew where she was coming from. Well said, Dark Lord. The real badduns in Hogwarts are the incredibly irritating airhead Hermione Granger ( ) and Potter himself ( )."},

Both   and Emirates are expected to be among the airlines affected, which could heap misery on World Cup-going football fans, with the tournament starting in Qatar on November 20.

The strikes will begin in the early hours of\u00a0Friday, November\u00a018 and will last until the early hours of\u00a0Monday, November 21.\u00a0 It is expected to lead to disruption, cancellations and delays at Heathrow terminals 2, 3 and 4.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said:\u00a0\u201cOur members at Dnata and Menzies undertake highly challenging roles and are simply seeking a decent pay rise.  \"Both companies are highly profitable and can fully afford to make a fair pay increase.  \"The owners and directors are simply lining their own pockets rather than paying their workers fairly. \u201cThe workers at Heathrow will have Unite\u2019s complete support during this dispute.\u201d Other airlines that will be hit heavily by the strike action include  , Singapore Airlines and Cathay-Pacific.  Passengers returning to the   for the Thanksgiving holiday are also expected to be affected. A spokesperson for Dnata told Sun Online Travel: \u201cIt is disappointing that Unite plans to progress with this costly industrial action, despite our offer to staff of an award which, with previous increases, amounts to a pay rise of 15.5% (20.2% for HGV drivers) since December 2021.  \"This is in line with inflation and amongst the best in the industry. \u201cWe would like to reassure our customers, partners and passengers that we are implementing contingency plans to minimise disruption to our operations. \u201cThe increase in salary suggested by Unite is irresponsible and would undoubtedly impact our business\u2019 ability to operate in the best interest of our workforce in the long term. \u201cOur offer has been overwhelmingly accepted by other staff at the airport and we remain committed to reaching a meaningful and mutually acceptable agreement for all parties.\u201d A Menzies spokesperson added: \u201cUnite are being incredibly obstructive by refusing to join discussions regarding a pay increase for our Heathrow ground handling workforce.  \"We urge Unite to take part in these negotiations, alongside the other trade union, and to continue separate discussions with our Heathrow cargo operations.  \"This threatening of industrial action is all about creating sensationalist headlines rather than doing what\u2019s right for their members.  \"Strike action will benefit no-one and will only delay the process at a time when our employees need the increase now.  \"We are ready and willing to continue pay discussions, which we believe is in the best interest of our employees. \"I also want to reassure our airline customers and their passengers that we have robust contingency plans in place should Unite elect to continue with unnecessary industrial action.\u201d Meanwhile,   heading to Qatar have been warned not to behave in a certain way.

She's going to be amazing. \"She is going to be the person that brings a little bit of light when there are tough times there.

That's going to be a really interesting dynamic.\" Hayley, who is  spends a lot of time in Middlesbrough, which is just a short drive from Jill's hometown of Sunderland. She said: \"I love the fact she's from the north east.

While her dad might not be fond of the England national side, Hayley will be cheering on Gareth Southgate's men. Recalling a family holiday during a World Cup years ago, Hayley laughed about ex-Manchester United defender Gordon's reaction to her mum's patriotic swimwear. She said: \"He hates England doing well, always has done, always will do. My mum is English. I remember one holiday she came out by the pool in an England bikini and my dad nearly spat his beer out.\" Despite the interfamily conflict, Hayley said: \"I hope they perform well. So many of the footballers are like young boys, and I feel for them, especially after what happened in the Euros and penalty situation, you realise how potentially damaging that can be to mental health of such youngsters. I think bless them all.  \"As I'm getting older I'm seeing footballers differently, a sort of motherly way or older sisterly way as opposed to fancying David Beckham or Lee Sharpe and whoever it might be.\" Ahead of the competition, Hayley teamed up with Samsung and former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher to analyse some of the most controversial World Cup decisions ever and see if VAR would have changed the outcome. The list was compiled from the results of a poll of 2,000 football fans, commissioned by Samsung UK to showcase the new 2022 range of Neo QLED TVs. Topping the pile is Diego Maradona's infamous Hand of God against England in the 1986 World Cup. VAR would have ruled the goal out sending the game to a penalty shootout potentially paving the way for England to win its second global competition. Number two is Frank Lampard's disallowed goal against Germany in 2010, which would have been given had VAR been in use. And third is Thierry Henry\u2019s handball for France against Ireland in a 2010 World Cup Qualifier. With the right tech in place, the goal would have been disallowed and Ireland could have fought on to penalties. Hayley said: \"These were so obvious you were like 'how was that not seen?' Maybe because of the way technology has come on, not just VAR but in terms of the actual screen on the TV itself. You can literally see the finger nails of the referee getting a card out. You can get that close. You can see every part of the screen in super HD.  \"Watching it blown up you're like 'how the hell can they miss that?', but viewers at home didn't have multi-angle camera replays to scrutinise either.\" \u00a0"},

Officers from the US, Britain,    ,  ,  and  will make up a patchwork police force drafted in to keep order at the month-long football extravaganza. The extra cops will provide security at the eight stadiums in Doha and hotels where the 32 national football squads\u00a0are staying as part of \"Operation   Shield\". Some of the hardest police units including Turkey's special operations unit, known as the Polis-\u00d6zel-Harekat, and , will be beefing up security.  The team of terrifying Turkish cops are mostly used to fight terrorism in their home country but has previously been criticised for human rights violations - particularly against those in Kurdish areas. Armed with rifles, handguns and with its own attack helicopter and numerous armoured vehicles the POH is armed to the teeth.  The squad also has its own fierce female unit - one of a handful of security forces in the world to do so.  Along with 3,000 riot police, Turkey has offered its own warship to bolster security at the World Cup for six months.   The TCG Burgazad, along with 250 troops, has already been deployed to Doha in the last month.  According to a report by Nordic Monitor, an NGO that detects terrorist activity, the special forces unit will not be held responsible for its action or any damages in the Gulf state.  During a debate over the security protocol, opposition lawmakers criticised the use of Turkish cops as 'mercenaries'.  French officers specialised in anti-drone policing will also make up the bulk of their own 191-strong force. Bomb-disposal experts, sniffer dogs, an anti-terror unit and cops specialised in tackling football hooliganism will all be deployed.  The French riot cops came under scrutiny just months ago after shocking footage showed\u00a0  outside the Stade De France in   at the\u00a0  Final.

Opposition lawmakers flagged the ethical implications of sending French officers to protect the country's \"air-conditioned cemeteries\" - referring to the tournament\u2019s brand-new facilities. \u00a0 And they also raised concerns about the treatment of female cops in Qatar - a country known for its strict Islamic code and  .  France's interior ministry confirmed to   that their force in Qatar would include female officers. The ministry said the decision to deploy French security personnel followed a \"request by Qatari authorities\" and would help ensure the security of fans - including French nationals.

Turkey is set to send 100 special operations police, 50 bomb specialists and 80 sniffer dogs and riot dogs to monitor any terrorist activity.  It will also be taking charge of the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence operations at the tournament.  The country's cops are being taught English and given guidance about what to expect when they arrive in Qatar, a Turkish source told Reuters. They said: \"During the tournament, Turkish police will only take orders from their Turkish superiors who are serving temporarily in Qatar.\" \"The Qatari side will not be able to give direct orders to the Turkish police. \"All expenses of the personnel deployed... will be covered by the state of Qatar.\" Nearly 800 Qataris have also been trained by Turkey on issues ranging from \"sports safety\" to \"intervention in social events\". Meanwhile, Pakistan's cabinet approved a draft agreement last month to allow the government to offer\u00a0troops for the tournament - although numbers have not been confirmed.   Morocco has also backed sending officers to Qatar, with local media reporting that several thousand could be deployed. And South Korea has sent military police officers with experience in counter-terror and maintaining public order to help train Qatari cops.  According to Yonhap, the contingent is made up of \"veteran soldiers with experience in overseas military units, anti-terror special task force, arrests of violent military criminals, presidential office guards, and various national events guards\". Spain had been considering sending 115 officers - but ultimately refused. As the first Middle East country to host a World Cup - and the smallest nation to do so - Qatar has no previous experience of hosting events on such a scale. Members of Qatar\u2019s police forces already met with cops in New York in\u00a0January\u00a0to exchange tips for security during major events.  And in July, the\u00a0US signed agreements with Qatar to \"identify air passengers linked to terrorism, trafficking, detecting watchlisted travellers, and monitoring potential security risks at Hamad International Airport\". The UK, whose forces regularly carry out drills with their Qatari counterparts,\u00a0has also said it will be sending units from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force to support counterterrorism efforts.\u00a0 A unit of Brit cops set to be deployed will act as a buffer between fans and potentially over-zealous local forces to \"de-escalate\" issues at the tournament.  Fifteen special UK police \"engagement officers\" have been roped in to \"calm things down if needed\".  Cheshire Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the UK\u2019s top football cop, said: \u201cOur officers will be there to try to engage and calm things down if needed. \u201cWe\u2019re not morality police and we are not going to tell people not to protest. \u201cThat\u2019s a local enforcement issue. We just want to look after the supporters. \u201cThe last thing we want is someone inadvertently causing offence, so if we see there's something that may cause a problem we can go and try to de-escalate the situation.\" The last thing we want is someone inadvertently causing offence, so if we see there's something that may cause a problem we can go and try to de-escalate the situation Mr Roberts said the \"potential for a misunderstanding is probably greater\" in Qatar.  \u201cWe know that England fans have often gone to a square and drunk but that\u2019s not really an option because you don't have the off-sales in Qatar in the same way. \u201cIf you have 2,000 fans in one place, even in the UK, you\u2019d get the police come in and sometimes when England have played abroad our fans have played up to it a bit. \u201cWe just want to avoid that.\" Hundreds of Qatari nationals have also been called up to man security checkpoints at the stadiums. The conscripts will manage security queues, and check fans for drugs or weapons concealed in ponytails, jacket linings or even false bellies, according to training materials seen by Reuters. In early September the civilians were ordered to report for pre-dawn duty at the national service camp north of the Qatari capital Doha. A source said civilians were told it was their \"patriotic duty\" to help out with the World Cup.  \"Most people are there because they have to be - they don't want to get in trouble,\" the source said. The current group of civilians are on four months paid leave from their jobs at key Qatari institutions such as state-owned QatarEnergy and the foreign ministry, the source said. Conscripts report to the national service camp five days a week, where they attend training sessions - and are taught to approach fans with \"positive body language, focus and a smile\". Training also includes hour-long marching drills on the parade ground. A Qatari government official\u00a0said: \"Recruits will provide additional support during the tournament as part of the regular program, just as they do every year at major public events, such as the National Day celebration.\""},

Home Secretary  called the current situation , emotive language that offered an open goal to Braverman\u2019s establishment enemies. But let\u2019s not quibble about semantics.

And I am sick of those who talk as if there is any lasting solution other than stopping the boats in the first place. No, the Royal Navy are not going to repel the boats, or sink them, or enforce gunboat diplomacy. Because our history tells us we are not that kind of country. But the current system is not working and if the numbers are not controlled, the UK will be a far uglier, less welcoming country than it was before. The processing system is so slow it is comatose. Nearly 130,000 asylum seekers and their families are currently waiting to be processed.  And 96 per cent of those who landed last year are still waiting.  Until their applications are heard \u2014 most will of course be successful \u2014 the British taxpayer shells out for their keep. This is not a racist country but when illegal migrants are put up at taxpayers\u2019 expense in luxury hotels, racism is actively fomented. Can we hold out a helping hand to the genuinely needy without being a soft touch? Can we be caring without being a nation of mugs? Can we even learn to work with ? Probably not. But the alternative is building a town the size of Macclesfield or Margate every year. And we can\u2019t do that, either. But this is the greatest country in the world, and that is the heart of our national dilemma. Because if you were living in Albania or the EU, then you would probably want to live here too.

He will hate that because mentally he will still think he can play but physically, no matter how much he beasts his body, which he does, it is one day going to stop working as effectively as it did 10 years ago. It's already slowing down. \"He hated sitting on the bench. He forgot he's not bigger than Manchester United when they asked him to come off the subs bench and should have just gone on and played, really I think he feels very embarrassed about that now. \"I really of think he will have beaten himself up over that and realised how bad it looked.

I\u2019d flown out to LA when he was at LA Galaxy and sat there with my camera man and the lights and everything, and we had this big production and set up to do this big feature interview with him, and he just walked in on his own. I was like 'where\u2019s your team?\u2019 We were in the football stadium in a box, but you\u2019d maybe expect a guy from the PR department, or a manager, or his agent, or even a hairstylist or makeup person, just nothing.\" Recalling another encounter around the London 2012 Olympics, she said: \"I worked with David Beckham for Samsung many years ago, it was the 2012 Olympic launch. Backstage I stood there, and I hadn\u2019t seen him for years and years and years, this was before I interviewed him at LA Galaxy, and he was like \u2018how's your dad doing?' Man United, Bryan Robson - one of my legends, he starts telling me about what it\u2019s like when he watched Man Utd - and I\u2019m like \u2018you\u2019re David Beckham\u2019.\" Hayley, who is the daughter of Scotland and Man United legend Gordon McQueen, will be glued to the screen for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this month.

She said: \"He hates England doing well, always has done, always will do. My mum is English. I remember one holiday she came out by the pool in an England bikini and my dad nearly spat his beer out.\" Despite the interfamily conflict, Hayley said: \"I hope they perform well. So many of the footballers are like young boys, and I feel for them, especially after what happened in the Euros and penalty situation, you realise how potentially damaging that can be to mental health of such youngsters. I think bless them all.  \"As I'm getting older I'm seeing footballers differently, a sort of motherly way or older sisterly way as opposed to fancying David Beckham or Lee Sharpe and whoever it might be.\" Ahead of the competition, Hayley teamed up with Samsung and former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher to analyse some of the most controversial World Cup decisions ever and see if VAR would have changed the outcome. The list was compiled from the results of a poll of 2,000 football fans, commissioned by Samsung UK to showcase the new 2022 range of Neo QLED TVs. Topping the pile is Diego Maradona's infamous Hand of God against England in the 1986 World Cup. VAR would have ruled the goal out sending the game to a penalty shootout potentially paving the way for England to win its second global competition. Number two is Frank Lampard's disallowed goal against Germany in 2010, which would have been given had VAR been in use. And third is Thierry Henry\u2019s handball for France against Ireland in a 2010 World Cup Qualifier. With the right tech in place, the goal would have been disallowed and Ireland could have fought on to penalties. Hayley said: \"These were so obvious you were like 'how was that not seen?' Maybe because of the way technology has come on, not just VAR but in terms of the actual screen on the TV itself. You can literally see the finger nails of the referee getting a card out. You can get that close. You can see every part of the screen in super HD.  \"Watching it blown up you're like 'how the hell can they miss that?', but viewers at home didn't have multi-angle camera replays to scrutinise either.\" \u00a0"},

{"title": "Three Lions ace Ivan Toney investigated by FA over match-betting ahead of this month\u2019s World Cup", "author": "Rob Pattinson", "date": "5 Nov 2022", "content": "THREE Lions ace Ivan Toney is at the centre of a match-betting probe. The \u00a350million  striker is being investigated by   officials over allegations of wagers placed on games. Toney, 26, is widely expected to be in England\u2019s squad for the  , which starts a fortnight today. Astonishingly, despite the ongoing investigation, he was picked for Three Lions duty during recent Nations League matches \u2014 but did not play. The allegations are believed to relate solely to the period when Toney was at one of his previous clubs. A source said: \u201cIvan is aware of the investigation. He is concerned but is adamant that he has done nothing wrong. \u201cThe FA is duty-bound to act fully on allegations they receive. But it is obviously a highly sensitive matter for the FA as he is a potential candidate for the England World Cup squad.\u201d No charges have been brought by FA chiefs against the player. There is no suggestion of any criminal activity by Toney \u2014 who also previously played for Newcastle United \u2014 or that he attempted to fix the outcome of any match. However, under FA rules, all \u00adprofessional men and top women players face a worldwide ban on all football betting. The laws are so strict they include gambling on transfers, manager jobs and team selection and apply to players and managers, match officials and club staff. They state that players \u201cshall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with a football match or competition. \u201cOr any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.\u201d Last night Toney tweeted: \u201cI have been assisting the Football Association with their enquiries and will not be making any comment until such investigation has reached its conclusion.\u00a0 \u201cI am a proud Englishman and it has always been my dream to play for my country at a World Cup.\u201d Toney \u2014 regarded as one of the world\u2019s best penalty-takers \u2014 was selected for Three Lions duty for Nations League matches against Germany and Italy in September. Despite hailing Toney\u2019s place at the training camp, England boss Southgate failed to use him, then appeared to cast doubt on his squad place.\u00a0 Southgate said: \u201cI understand the push as it is so close to the World Cup but there is life for   beyond the World Cup as well. He\u2019s very much in the frame and what he does with his club between now and then is also really important.\u201d The fact that he was selected by FA bosses while he was being probed by the investigators from the same organisation will prompt questions about the governing body\u2019s handling of the matter. If Toney is found to have breached FA rules his selection would be in conflict with the FA\u2019s commitment to transparency over betting. Its website says: \u201cThe FA wants to preserve what is great in the beautiful game and has devised rules regarding betting in football to help protect the integrity and future of football.\u201d It adds: \u201cThe FA, the Gambling Commission and betting companies have sophisticated systems to monitor and detect breaches of the betting rules. These organisations advise us of issues that arise in the cash, telephone and online betting markets. \u201cIf found guilty, then this can lead to financial penalties, suspensions, and in some instances, lifetime bans. \u201cIt is your responsibility to make sure you know the rules and help support the collective effort from the football authorities, players, clubs and officials, to protect the integrity of the game. The rules have never been clearer or easier to understand.\u201d A source said: \u201cIt seems incredible that a high-profile star could be chosen for England duty at the same time that he is being investigated over betting. England footballers are role models for millions of youngsters and their conduct in relation to the sport must reflect that status. \u201cFans have a right to know if a star player is being probed \u2014 their focus must be entirely on winning the World Cup with no distractions.\u201d Tory MP Julian Knight, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: \u201cThese are serious allegations being made. \u201cFootball needs to be transparent. Any allegation of this nature needs to be investigated and there is a clear public interest.\u201d Although there is no suggestion Toney is a gambling addict,   is concerned about the impact of gambling on players. He witnessed first-hand its impact on ex-England team-mates  ,   and   when he was a player. Before taking up his current role, he said: \u201cGambling is an addictive pastime. I think it\u2019s for the national manager to step in if they feel there is an issue.\u00a0 \u201cPeople have always gambled in squads and sometimes in the squads I was involved in it got people together. But some of the sums being spoken at the moment would be disturbing no matter what you\u2019re earning. \u201cThere is a duty for everybody involved to make sure those problems don\u2019t get out of hand.\u201d\u00a0 The FA\u2019s regulations were put in place after football was rocked by a string of betting controversies in 2014. A number of top players have been hit with bans \u2014 though they all involved more serious conduct than that being investigated over Toney. In 2020   and fined \u00a3150,000 for texting brother Leon to bet on his possible move from Liverpool to Sevilla. In 2019  and fined \u00a370,000 for WhatsApping pals \u201cLump on if you want\u201d over his rumoured move to Atletico Madrid. In 2017,   after placing 1,260 bets on matches between 2006 and 2013 \u2014 including games in which he played. In October   for deliberately earning a yellow card in an FA Cup first-round tie. He was hit with a ten-year ban for the scam with pals and a further two years for failing to co-operate with the FA investigation and further betting. Toney\u2019s agent and the FA were approached for comment.\u00a0 By Michael Hamilton He has won plaudits for his swashbuckling style and has scored eight times this season for Premier League side Brentford. Toney joined Newcastle in 2015 as a teenager but only made two appearances for the Toon, who sent him out on loans. He plied his trade at Wigan, Scunthorpe and Barnsley. He moved to Peterborough in 2018 \u2014 scoring 40 times in 76 appearances before switching to Brentford in 2020 for a modest \u00a35million. Toney scored 31 Championship goals to fire the West London club into the Premier League. His good form continued last season as he scored 12 times. He has an impressive penalty record \u2013 netting 25 of 26 spot-kicks. A World Cup place would take him to new heights."},

{"title": "Dream Team World Cup gaffers backing Lionel Messi to put the demons of 2014 to rest in Qatar", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "9 Nov 2022", "content": "EVER since Lionel Messi was not much older than a toddler, when he jinked past his first opponent in a vaguely familiar style, the legacy of Diego Maradona has cast a shadow over him. As an Argentine footballer, living up to the nation's most outrageous talent is a near impossible task. And yet, in many ways, Messi has surpassed Maradona, scoring more goals, providing more assists, winning more trophies and doing it all with a stylistic panache at least equal to that of El Pibe de Oro. However, only one No10 has delivered a World Cup for Argentina almost single-handedly (not a deliberate Hand of God reference). Maradona's campaign in Mexico in '86 is the stuff of legends, remembered as the greatest ever showing from an individual on the biggest stage sport has to offer. His mazy dribble against England in the quarter-finals is regularly cited as the best goal of all time and so when Messi scored an eerily similar goal for Barcelona against Getafe in 2007, the pressure on the latter to flourish into the second coming was cemented for eternity. For a long while, Messi has known that no matter what he achieves at club level, he will not be as revered in his homeland as Maradona unless he delivers a World Cup. He came ever so close in 2014, inspiring the Albiceleste to the final in Brazil where they were ultimately defeated by Germany through Mario Gotze's extra-time strike. Messi was named Player of the Tournament, just as Maradona was in '86, but without the trophy the comparison was nothing. Barca's all-time top scorer broke his international duck in 2021 when Argentina beat Brazil in the final of Copa America. Messi finished as top scorer and top assist provider in the tournament, an effort wholly appreciated by his compatriots, but the standards expected of the all-time greats are stratospheric. The Copa America triumph was one to celebrate but it did not exorcise the demons of 2014 - only victory in Qatar, Messi's last World Cup, could do that. So how likely is it that the 35-year-old will write a fairytale ending to his story, a triumph that would probably cement him as the outright greatest player in history, if he isn't already? Lionel Scaloni's side are second-favourites to succeed in Qatar according to most bookmakers, and deservedly so. By the time the tournament gets underway, Argentina will have gone almost three and a half years unbeaten in all competitions. This is in stark contrast to several of the fancied European giants (France, Germany, England, Spain) who have all suffered more defeats than they would have liked in the last year or so. Messi and company have been drawn in Group C alongside Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland - a reasonably favourable set of fixtures all things considered. However, one factor to consider is that Argentina have played very few European teams in recent times because of Covid restrictions - although they did beat Italy 3-0 in the Finalissima, a meeting between the champions of South America and Europe. And rather ominously, Messi scored all five goals in his side's 5-0 win over Estonia earlier this year - something of a warning shot to every team set to frequent Qatar this winter. Dream Team World Cup gaffers are seemingly confident that the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner will impress at his last World Cup - his ownership of 30.2% makes him the sixth-most popular player in the game at this stage. Given a provisional price range of \u00a37m - \u00a37.5m, Messi could well be Dream Team World Cup's most-expensive player when prices are finalised next week but his price tag evidently isn't much of a deterrent. Dream Team World Cup managers should also note the legendary No10's superb form for PSG this season - he's scored 11 goals and provided 14 assists in just 17 appearances across Ligue 1 and the Champions League. Messi is one of those players who could seriously hurt you if you leave him out of your XI, especially with Argentina set to take on Saudi Arabia in their first group game."},

{"title": "Dream Team World Cup: Spain\u2019s star players, potential flops and bargain options", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "9 Nov 2022", "content": "DREAM TEAM WORLD CUP gaffers will mostly be selecting players who represent countries with a realistic chance of lifting the trophy in Qatar. So in the build-up to the opening game - which is now just 11 days away - we're analysing the top eight favourites according to the bookmakers. We've already   and today it's Spain's turn under the spotlight. Alvaro Morata has his detractors but while it's true the 30-year-old is not the most clinical finisher around, Luis Enrique appreciates what the striker offers in other aspects of the game. Excellent in the air and well-suited to La Roja's possession-based approach, Morata has the benefit of being the focal point for a team full of creative talent. If you back Spain to thrive in Group E (Costa Rica, Japan, Germany) then Morata, who scored the winner for Portugal in his last last international outing, should be a good selection from a Dream Team World Cup perspective even if you don't see him as one of the team's most-important players - remember, points are everything. At 19 years old, Pedri is already one of the best midfielders in the world and his exemplary technique will be crucial in determining how slickly Spain go about their business. However, Dream Team World Cup bosses should note that the Barcelona starlet is not one of those midfielders who deals in regular goal involvements. His career is still in its infancy but he's yet to score more than five goals in a season and he's also still awaiting his first goal in international football. Pedri is a generational talent but his style is not suited to Dream Team World Cup where goal involvements reign supreme - see also: Gavi. Unai Simon should be first-choice goalkeeper and with a provisional price range of \u00a33.5m - \u00a34m he may end up a fraction cheaper than his peers from the other favoured nations - helpful. These players are only potential 'flops' in the realm of Dream Team World Cup. For example, Ansu Fati is an exciting talent and as an ambitious winger he fits the profile Dream Team World Cup managers should be seeking out. However, the 20-year-old is likely to be used as second-half substitute - he can be effective against tiring legs - and will therefore be restricted in terms of point-scoring opportunities. Rodri and Sergio Busquets are both pushing to start as the deepest of Spain's three midfielders but, again, neither are attack-minded enough to rack up plentiful points. It's rare to find a true bargain among the top teams as quality usually comes at a price but there is one relatively affordable option in Enrique's ranks. If Pablo Sarabia is priced at the lower end of his provisional range (\u00a33.5m - \u00a34m) then he could offer good value for money. The PSG midfielder has scored nine goals and provided three assists in 24 caps since his senior debut in 2019. That breaks down further to a goal involvement every 105.3 minutes for Spain! The 30-year-old is one of the unsung heroes of his national side in recent years and he's likely to be overlooked the vast majority of Dream Team World Cup managers in favour of more recognisable names."},

Former   footballer Khalid Salman has said fans coming into the Gulf state for the tournament \"will have to accept our rules\". In Qatar, being gay is illegal and is punishable under the country's penal code with up to seven years in prison or even the death penalty for Muslims under sharia law. Some football players have raised concerns over the rights of fans travelling to the event, especially   individuals and women, who rights groups say Qatari laws discriminate against. The country expects more than one million visitors for the  In an interview filmed in Doha, Salman told German television broadcaster ZDF said he believes being gay to be \"haram\". The 60-year-old said: \"During the World Cup, many things will come here to the country. Let's talk about gays. \"The most important thing is, everybody will accept that they come here. But they will have to accept our rules.\" \"(Homosexuality) is haram. You know what haram (forbidden) means?\" When asked why it was haram, Salman said: \"I am not a strict Muslim but why is it haram? Because it is damage in the mind.\" The interview was then immediately stopped by an accompanying official.  Human Rights Watch senior researcher Rasha Younes has branded Salman's remarks as \"harmful and unacceptable\". She told The Sun: \"The failure of the Qatari government to counter this false information has a significant impact on the lives of LGBT residents of Qatar, ranging from fueling discrimination and violence against them to justifying subjecting them to state-sponsored conversion practices.  \"These comments are yet another dismissal of LGBT residents\u2019 basic rights by the Qatari authorities, and only serve to further exclude them from the public sphere.\u201d Charity Stonewall has also hit out at Salman, calling his comments \"appalling\". Robbie de Santos, director of communications and external affairs at Stonewall, told The Sun: \"LGBTQ+ people in Qatar are criminalised for simply existing and are forced to hide who they are.  \"In 2022, it is deeply concerning that countries with appalling human rights records are rewarded with the rights to host one of the world largest sporting tournaments. \"These appalling comments highlight why\u00a0it is vital that the international community make clear that they expect Qatari authorities to respect and uphold freedom of expression, and the rights of all including LGBTQ+ people. \"When we\u00a0pledge our support for LGBTQ+ Qataris\u00a0by signing up to Stonewall\u2019s \u2018Proud Stadium\u2019 it sends an important message that football fans stand in solidarity with marginalised groups in Qatar and in 70 countries across the world who continue to face horrific persecution for simply being themselves.\" Qatar's World Cup organisers, when contacted by Reuters, declined to comment on Salman's remarks. World soccer's ruling body FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The full interview, which is part of a documentary, will be shown Tuesday night on ZDF. It comes as former FIFA chief Sepp Blatter said giving Qatar the World Cup was a \"mistake\". The country was awarded hosting rights in 2010 when Blatter was in charge. He said today told Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger \"Qatar is a mistake,\" adding that \"the choice was bad.\" Blatter said: \"It is too small of a country. Football and the World Cup are too big for it.\" He said FIFA in 2012 amended the criteria it used to select host countries in light of concerns over the working conditions at tournament-related construction sites in Qatar. Blatter added: \"Since then, social considerations and human rights are taken into account.\" Organisers have repeatedly said everyone was welcome in Qatar during the World Cup. Qatar is the first Middle Eastern country to host the World Cup, but the small nation has come under intense pressure in recent years for its treatment of foreign workers and restrictive social laws. The country's human rights record has led to calls for teams and officials to boycott the tournament, which runs from November 20 to December 18.

And as one of our brightest midfielders departs for the greatest shop window in global sport,   chairman  \u2019s farewell wave could be way more significant than the American billionaire thinks. If things go really well,   will not be back on English soil until December 19 \u2014 leaving him with just over 18 months left on his Stamford Bridge deal. Talks are meant to be ongoing about a new one but so far there\u2019s been no noise from the Chelsea boys about tying down one of their own for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, his boyhood academy pal Reece James was nailed to the colours with a six-year deal at the start of the season. And incoming manager  was handed a five-year deal by Boehly while sacked Thomas Tuchel was still clearing his desk at the training ground. Mount did not have his best game in a Chelsea shirt during Sunday\u2019s  . But he is not alone in that. Three times in the past month he has been Man of the Match for a team struggling to get to grips with the ideas of Potter. When players head off to major international tournaments they like their head space to be trained only upon the job at hand. Which means important negotiations between Mount and Chelsea are likely to be mothballed until the turn of the year at the earliest. If Boehly is not careful, he will stray into   territory. The club and their fans are still smarting from the ludicrous dithering over a new contract, which ended with their best defender and biggest character leaving on a free transfer at the end of last season. The German went public and admitted that he would have loved to stay in England but when the terms he wanted failed to materialise, he skipped off to Real Madrid. And his fellow defender Andreas Christensen was also allowed to leave for nothing, landing Chelsea with a major rebuild job on their defence in the summer. Settling a contract for Mount should be one of the simplest tasks in Boehly\u2019s in-tray. The boy has blue blood having been at Chelsea since he was six. Yet maybe that is what\u2019s holding him back? It\u2019s only when you threaten to leave that many employers suddenly realise your true value to them.  That\u2019s not exclusive to football. And it\u2019s not only Mount facing this awkward position under new owners at Chelsea, who consistently trumpet their passion for \u2018long-termism\u2019. Jorginho, currently holding the midfield together in the absence of injured N\u2019Golo Kante, is in an even more uncertain position. The Italian\u2019s deal expires at the end of this season and there has been total silence so far on progress towards one of the club\u2019s key players signing an extension. Keeper Edouard Mendy is also in a stand-off with the club as he prepares to head to the Middle East with Senegal. Mendy will be a free agent next season and there is still no sign of a contract agreement in place. Potter was talking tactics last week when he admitted that, when trying new things, you must be prepared to look like \u201can idiot\u201d. Boehly is not there yet but if he is not careful, history will repeat itself with some of his best players and he won\u2019t look quite the business genius who can make Chelsea great again."},

{"title": "This winter will be Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s last dance at the World Cup \u2013 are Dream Team World Cup bosses overlooking him?", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "8 Nov 2022", "content": "CRISTIANO RONALDO has scored 117 goals in international football, more than any other player in the history of men's football. Since his 30th birthday, he's scored 66 goals in 73 appearances for Portugal. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner's pedigree is well known, yet it's worth repeating on the brink of the 2022 World Cup -   - as Qatar is likely to play host to his last dance at the most prestigious tournament of the lot.  Ronaldo is one of the greatest players of all time and victory at Euro 2016 ensured he ticked off an international trophy on his elite checklist (he also collected a Nations League medal in 2018/19) but the World Cup has rarely been a joyous stage for him. Whereas Pele and Diego Maradona both defined their legacies with World Cup triumphs, the Portuguese No7 and his contemporary, Lionel Messi, have achieved greatness despite frustrations on the biggest stage of them all. In 2006, Ronaldo was one of the most promising young talents on display but he was developing as a more traditional winger, hence why he scored just the one goal as Portugal finished fourth in Germany. In South Africa in 2010, his only goal came in a 7-0 thrashing of North Korea - a strike which ended a rare drought of 16 months in international football. Four years later, he played through a injury and was noticeably hampered, not even his late winner against Ghana could drag Portugal to the knockout stages. This was a case of terrible luck and timing for Ronaldo as the tournament in Brazil coincided most closely with his peak years - he scored 61 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid in the season that followed. All this meant that by the time he was preparing for his fourth edition of the tournament in 2018, his record at the world's most-watched sporting event read: three goals in 14 games. Ronaldo set about realigning the numbers with a superb hat-trick against Spain in his first outing in Russia - his most memorable World Cup moment to date. A goal against Morocco in the following group game bolstered his record further but defeat to Uruguay in the round of 16 meant Portuguese fans were once again left disappointed with their side's efforts at the tournament that matters most. Now 37 years old, Ronaldo is ready for one final throw of the dice in a World Cup setting and anyone who has observed his career even casually will know his mentality towards the task at hand, such is his relentless desire for accomplishments. And it's his state of mind that could be his greatest asset in Qatar now that his speed and physical sharpness have diminished with age. Erik ten Hag has made sparing use of Ronaldo for Man United this season and, truth be told, the Red Devils have generally played better without their legendary No7 on the pitch. Still Ronaldo possesses a sense of inevitability and hunger for goals that is unmatched in world football. Fernando Santos, whose stint as Portugal coach has coincided with the best years of Ronaldo in international football, will hope to harness his captain's main character energy in Qatar and may even be thankful that his workload at club level has been managed this term. And it wasn't that long ago Ronaldo claimed the Golden Boot at Euro 2020, which is why it's surprising how few Dream Team World Cup gaffers have included him in their provisional teams so far. It's early days but an ownership of 6.5% makes him just the 12th-most popular striker in the game. Portugal have been drawn against Uruguay, Ghana and South Korea in Group H and while that promises to be one of the more competitive sets of fixtures, Santos' side are favourites to come out on top. Darwin Nunez and Aleksandar Mitrovic currently appear in more teams. Ronaldo may be at the tail end of his career and his record of seven goals in 17 World Cup games might not align with his greatness in other competitions but at the end of the day he is still Ronaldo - betting against him in rarely profitable. Dream Team World Cup managers are encouraged to select provisional teams now, prices and updated squads will be finalised next week - you can make as many changes to your XI as you like until the tournament gets underway."},

{"title": "Gabriel Jesus\u2019 dry streak is concern for his mentality but no issue for Arsenal who gain so much from his all-round game", "author": null, "date": "8 Nov 2022", "content": "WHEN a team wins so convincingly, scoring five, you would expect that team\u2019s centre forward to have been among the goals.  So, when Arsenal did exactly that  , and Gabriel Jesus failed to score for the seventh successive match in which he featured, some may question the Brazilian\u2019s form or his role. However, even now, two games on having   and still without a goal, I would suggest those who do criticise might not be Arsenal supporters. I am concerned that  is not scoring of late, but that is a concern for the player himself and not for my team. I am anxious for Jesus purely because I can see that the man himself is concerned at not scoring.  His facial expressions and body language when he has failed to convert chances lately, he himself expect to take, do worry me.  He seems to be putting pressure on himself as a main striker to score for his team and perhaps this self-imposed burden is beginning to cause him to snatch at chances. In pre-season and in the opening games the words that would come to mind when watching him score were 'natural' and 'relaxed'.  I feel at this point, as I am sure it is the case, that   needs to talk to the player, confirming that he should not feel individual pressure to score in every match, to relax and play his natural game.  Because without individual goals Jesus\u2019 natural game raises this team and the level of his teammates. Jesus is so much more to this Arsenal than a goal scorer and every Gooner knew this within the first few matches.  Against Forest, our No.9 touched the ball an incredible 76 times and only 16 of those  . In addition, he attempted more tackles in the 90 minutes than any other Arsenal player. In short the ex-Man City man is everywhere playing with such effervescence and purpose that he is improving the level of EVERY player in a red shirt. His pure energy and enthusiasm for the press, has enabled  , Martin Odegaard, Granit Xhaka and Bukayo Saka to join him and make Arsenal\u2019s press so much more effective than it was last season with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or Alexandre Lacazette.  If even one player is not pressing consistently and at the right moments it can let down the team and make it a weakness rather than a strength and I think we have seen that at  this season after they lost Sadio Mane. Jesus' pure skill with ball at feet and particularly in the penalty box not only terrifies defenders but creates space and opportunities for others. He is so good in these tight spaces that he will virtually always draw more than one defender to him, which leaves another Arsenal attacker unmarked. Martinelli is a main beneficiary. Jesus footballing intelligence results in him making runs purely to draw defenders out of position. He is such a team player that he will often do this even if that run takes him away from the position where he might score.  Jesus is all about the team - not about individual glory. It\u2019s why   often selected him in the really big games and also why his personal goal return has seldom been better than one in three. The real statistic to look at is the number of goals Arsenal are scoring this season with him in the team, compared to last season.  After 13   fixtures this season the club with Jesus sit top and have scored 31 goals. At the same point in 21/22 Arteta\u2019s side had only netted a meagre 15 times. Of course, Jesus\u2019 unselfish, all-action, creative contribution every week will see him gain more assists than most main strikers. He currently sits behind only  and Saka in the assist table but for those that watch him every week in the flesh his crucial goal involvements are far more than the five direct assists.  If Arsenal do continue to progress and perhaps win silverware the telling stat at the end of the campaign will be that Arsenal have three or four players into double figures, and not 25 in 30 from their centre forward. Jesus is making his colleagues better and setting higher standards for this Arsenal squad. I sense very strongly this is why Arteta wanted not only this type of forward but this one in particular. Our manager knew what he was investing the club\u2019s money in when he bought Jesus. And this fan\u2019s message to the Jesus is: Relax on the personal scoring front as the goals will come again without a shadow of a doubt. Yesterday we discovered that  !"},

Of course there can never be too much shame in defeat at the Etihad.  After all, most visitors are sent packing with their tail between their legs. But when it\u2019s a loss that makes it five domestic games without a win, against a distinctly second string   side, it does become something of a slap in the chops. And unfortunately for manager  , it\u2019s a feeling he is becoming worryingly familiar with.\u00a0 A toothless draw with Brentford, a caning at old club\u00a0Brighton, a home loss to  . Now this\u2026 and a trip to   to come in 48 hours.  Suddenly he\u2019s not so much looking like the new Messiah as just a very naughty boy. Yes, Potter can claim   had their moments last night.  To be fair, they were always going to enjoy the odd one. But the bottom line is they did nothing with them, either through wasteful finishing, or the odd flash of inspired goalkeeping. Yet they were few and far between. Most of the game was spent on the back foot.\u00a0 A night of desperate defending, last ditch tackles, and the odd lunatic one thrown in as well. Like the stupid, headstrong lunge from Trevor Chalobah which sent Riyad Mahrez tumbling on 54 minutes, before the Algerian picked himself up to whip in the resulting free kick. Although Armando Broja should get an unwelcome assist, for the way he jumped sideways and actually made himself smaller in the wall. Not that it wasn\u2019t a lead City didn\u2019t deserve.  They should already have been well ahead, probably already out of sight. As it is, they only had to wait another four minutes until they all but were, after the longest one-two you\u2019ll see all season.  Well, after a fashion at least. Julian Alvarez, wide on the left wing, floated a ball to Mahrez right on the other flank. He cut inside and had Edouard Mendy diving low to beat out his drive, before Alvarez was lively while defenders lounged, and he swept in the rebound. At times City were as bright as the pre-match light show.  And that was so impressive you half expected Pink Floyd to emerge from the tunnel, not a couple of football teams. Oh, and as for   admitting he couldn\u2019t blame any of his players for having half an eye on the  , with Qatar now so close? Well   clearly took that as a challenge.  Maybe it was because he was the only sure-fire Three Lion in the line-up and he relished the chance to take centre stage. Maybe it was just the opportunity to stick two fingers up at the   fan club, who insist the Leicester man is a better prospect. Whatever the reason, Grealish was a real box of tricks last night and if anyone deserved a goal, it was him. At least Chelsea got what they deserved though\u2026 another defeat.  For while they may well have enjoyed a few second half moments, all City had to do by then was see it out. To that point Potter\u2019s men hadn\u2019t raised pulses beyond the odd first half breakaway. Like the one which ended with such a weak shot from Christian Pulisic that the deflection off defender\u00a0back Rico Lewis was more of a threat to keeper Stefan Ortega, who saved with his legs. If Pulisic is as lethal for the USA when they face   in Qatar in a couple of weeks, that\u2019s pretty much three points in the bank already for   men, then. Ortega used his legs again when young Lewis Hall kept his cool and cut inside Lewis, the German stopper leaving his right foot trailing to block the danger. By the time he produced a genuine wonder stop \u2013 again to deny teenager Hall \u2013 City had more than enough breathing space and Chelsea had none. Although we should have come to realise by now that while most view the League Cup as a footballing trophy to scrape off the bottom of their shoe, Guardiola never has. Sure, he may give his second stringers a chance, but considering they\u2019d walk into pretty much every other team in the land, they are hardly makeweights. That\u2019s why City have lost only once in this competition in the past five years.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it will clearly take something special to beat them again this time, too.

However, the move has been controversial by fans, for a number of reasons. Firstly, the six balls cost 20k   (FUT) coins each, or 70k for the set. While FUT coins are unable to be purchased in game, third-party websites sell 70k for around \u00a310 ($12). This amount of coins would allow you to purchase around 10 FUT packs, which is 120 players and items. Despite the price, players were interested in the set in order to be able to play with some of the World Cup\u2019s more infamous balls. The ball used in the 2002\u2019s World Cup is considered one of the worst in the sport due to how light it was. Jabulani was used in 2010\u2019s World Cup and was also known for its weird trajectory. However, the set of footballs released as part of the promotion are just skins, and do not play any differently to the regular balls used in-game. Another complaint is that the ball used in 2018\u2019s World Cup is mysteriously missing. It is believed that the ball was not included in solidarity with Ukraine, because the tournament that year took place in Russia. However, this year the World Cup will take place in Qatar, a country known for human rights\u2019 abuses. In particular, there are 37 deaths linked directly to the building of the stadium for the World Cup. It is believed that there are many more deaths that have not been reported in connection with the event. There are reports that 6.5k migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded football's largest event. While developer EA Sports is not responsible for FIFA holding the World Cup in Qatar this year, the game will still introduce the World Cup mode into the game.

Southgate has stood by Maguire during the   man\u2019s nightmare season where he has lost his starting spot at Old Trafford and struggled with a thigh injury.

Ferdinand, 43, admitted: \u201cHarry has not let   down ever. He\u2019s been phenomenal for England. \u201cBut his form has gone out the window for Man Utd. He\u2019s not in the team, he\u2019s got an injury as well. \u201cGoing into a tournament, I couldn\u2019t think of another worst-case scenario. I would be concerned about that. \u201cYou can go in there with one, maybe, like that. But we\u2019ve got Walker and Maguire in the defensive line who are potentially going to be going in there off the back of injuries and a lack of form.\u201d Ferdinand won 81 caps in his 14 years playing for England. Being such a great player meant the likes of Jonathan Woodgate and   rarely got a look-in \u2014 two players who surely would rack up the appearances if they were playing today. Were there such depth at centre-back available to the current Three Lions boss, Ferdinand does not believe he would be so reliant on Maguire. He added: \u201cHe trusts him. It could be blind trust, I don\u2019t know. But he does trust him. As a manager you\u2019re going to go with what you know, with what you\u2019re comfortable with. \u201cThe problem he\u2019s got is it\u2019s not like he has four or five other candidates like in my generation where you\u2019d be able to go \u2018he\u2019s out of form\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019s not playing\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019s injured\u2019. \u201cI had Sol Campbell, Carragher, Woodgate, Ledley King, the list goes on. All of those players start today. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought if you\u2019re going to win a tournament, you\u2019ve got to have a good defence. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re probably at our weakest now. Even if there weren\u2019t injuries or lack of form, I feel like that was our weakest area anyway. \u201cWalker, our quickest defender, out. Maguire, form and injuries. When you\u2019re looking at it, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018What are we going to do?\u2019 Is (Trevoh) Chalobah going to be ready? He\u2019s playing really well. But last month it was (Fikayo) Tomori. Before that it was (Marc) Guehi. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in there that you go, \u2018They jump out as the No\u200a1 candidates to go and play\u2019. So it\u2019s very difficult. That could in the end be our Achilles heel.\u201d Despite his reservations over the Three Lions\u2019 backline, Ferdinand still reckons a successful tournament for England can only be defined if they come back with the trophy next month. It is what he sees as the next step after reaching the semi-finals in Russia and the final at Euro 2020. He said: \u201cIf you base it on the last two tournaments of semis and then final, surely the progression has to be to win it. \u201cAnything less is going to be seen as a bit underwhelming because you are looking at the trajectory and the FA\u2019s plans would have been that.\u201d To win it, England would most likely have to win a quarter-final against reigning champions France, who are many people\u2019s tip, including Ferdinand\u2019s, for the title. There are some that believe that whatever happens this could be Southgate\u2019s final tournament in charge, despite being contracted until 2024. The Three Lions chief copped flak over the summer for a run of six Nations League games without a win which included a 4-0 hiding at home to Hungary. Yet Ferdinand added: \u201cI don\u2019t know how seriously they take the Nations League. But he\u2019s earned the grace from what he\u2019s done. For just morale, given what we\u2019ve been through.\u201cHe was that close, a whisker away from winning the Euros. He\u2019s taken us to heights that we\u2019ve not seen since 1966, in two tournaments. \u201cHe obviously knows how to get through to the latter stages of a tournament. What are you going to get rid of that for?\u201d"},

{"title": "3 value-for-money defenders who could bring your Dream Team World Cup XI together", "author": "Nick Elliott", "date": "10 Nov 2022", "content": "DREAM TEAM WORLD CUP managers will obviously be desperate to include some big names in their XI this winter. However, the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Kevin De Bruyne  are sure to break the bank once player prices are finalised next week. That means gaffers will need to identify some cheaper, value-for-money options to balance the books - remember, teams with a total value over \u00a350million won't be eligible to score points. With that in mind, we've picked out three affordable defenders capable of punching above their weight in Qatar. Louis van Gaal has options aplenty at centre-back with the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Stefan De Vrij, Matthijs de Ligt and 21-year-old Ajax prospect Jurrien Timber also at his disposal. But what casual fans may not realise is that Ake is the leading candidate to start as the left-sided centre-back in the preferred 3-4-1-2 formation. Factor in the Netherlands' favourable group (Qatar, Ecuador, Senegal) and whether the Manchester City defender is confirmed at \u00a33m or \u00a33.5m, he will be reasonably priced. Granted, the Oranje haven't been as tight at the back as they would have liked in recent times but they've played some brilliant football and will be hopeful of clean sheets against Ecuador and the hosts - the AFCON champions will pose a greater threat. If the Crystal Palace centre-back is finalised at the top end of his provisional price range then 'value for money' might be pushing it but he would probably be worth a whirl at \u00a33m. Denmark are firmly in the territory of 'Dark Horses' having beaten France home and away this year. No European nation boasted a better record than Kasper Hjulmand's side in qualifying and, more relevant to this conversation, three goals conceded gave them the best defensive record. Andersen has started every Denmark game this calendar year so there's no need to worry about selection dilemmas. Group D is intriguingly poised with the Danes set to meet Didier Deschamps' mob again, as well as Tunisia and Australia.   Now this is a genuinely dirt-cheap option. The Fulham left-back is a key player for his country, potentially even more important than Barcelona/Milan's Sergino Dest on the opposite flank. Instinctively, Group B feels like a potentially cagey one, even group favourites England have prioritised control over attacking intent at major tournaments under Gareth Southgate. USA have their limitations but they're fit, strong and disciplined - they'll probably be harder to beat than most casual fans think. It certainly wouldn't be a surprise to see them register a clean sheet against Wales and/or Iran and given that Robinson contributed two goals and three assists in qualifying, he's got an outside chance of reaching double figures in terms of points before the end of the group stage. Obviously this punt comes with risk but that's what you get when you shop around the bargain aisle."},

Between 3,000 and 4,000   fans are expected to travel to   for the   group stages, with more set to follow if Gareth Southgate's side reaches the knockout stages. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000   supporters will fly out to cheer on their side, who have qualified for their first World Cup since 1958. This year's tournament is the first to take place in winter - due to Qatar's inhospitable desert climate - and the event has been wracked with controversy since it was announced in 2010. Some 6,500 migrant workers have died in the construction of the World Cup infrastructure - working out at 101 for every match played in the tournament. On Tuesday, disgraced former FIFA chairman  . Unlike relatively-relaxed Dubai some 200 miles away, Qatar has tougher restrictions on who can buy alcohol and where. Beer, wine, and spirits are largely restricted to purchase at restaurants linked to high-end hotels. Foreign residents who earn more than 3,000 Qatari riyals per month can apply for a licence to buy alcohol from shops, an option that isn't open to visitors. Public drunkenness is technically illegal and those found guilty face up to six months jail time and a fine of 3,000 riyals. However, in reality, Qatari officials often turn a blind eye to expats getting drunk, as long as they stay within the restaurants and hotels. The Middle-Eastern country's strict laws on alcohol, coupled with its expensive prices, mean it's not the easiest place to plan a pub crawl. Qatari organisers initially said they wanted the World Cup to be alcohol-free, but quickly backed down. Instead, some fanzones will sell \"international beverages\", and supporters will be able to buy beer inside the stadium perimeter in special \"beer areas\" up to three hours before each game. However, they won't be able to take drinks into the stands and spaces will be created to \"sober up\" inebriated supporters. Qatar\u2019s World Cup chief executive,\u00a0Nasser Al Khater said: \"There are plans in place for people to sober up if they\u2019ve been drinking excessively. \"It\u2019s a place to make sure that they keep themselves safe, they\u2019re not harmful to anybody else.\" Fans also can't bring any booze into the country, and authorities will confiscate any alcohol in travellers' luggage. The drug also has a zero-tolerance approach to drugs, and any fans caught smuggling cocaine into the country could face the death penalty. There are plans in place for people to sober up if they\u2019ve been drinking excessively Meanwhile, drinks giant Anheuser-Busch InBev Worldwide - which owns many of the world's most popular beer brands including Becks, Budweiser, Corona, and Stella Artois - is training up to 6,000 workers in Qatar to be able to pour a pint properly. The company says it expects a typical yearly amount of beer in Qatar will be consumed in the majority Muslim country during the four-week tournament, which kicks off on November 20. With no breweries in the region, beer was shipped to the country by ocean freight and stored in refrigerated warehouses to protect it from the blistering heat, as temperatures can still reach 30 degrees in November. Trucks will be loaded overnight indoors and then sent to restaurants and fan areas. \"Beer is a perishable product, so it's always best the day it's packed,\" the company's chief supply officer Peter Kraemer told Bloomberg in a recent interview. \"We manage our supply chain very closely for the amount of time that it takes for products to get from point A to point B, and then also the conditions under which they're shipped to preserve the taste of the beer.\" Bars and restaurants have been asked to order all their alcohol for the tournament months in advance. Kraemer said that the company also has a back-up plan if fans drink more than expected - with packages of bottles and cans ready to be filled at a UK brewery and shipped to Qatar at short notice. However, the experience is unlikely to be like any previous World Cup. Some of those who travel face stays in desert camps for hundreds of pounds, and may even have to base themselves in a neighbouring country due to the shortage of affordable accommodation in Qatar. Sports bars have been accused of exploiting visitors by charging fans up to \u00a3240 each to watch the World Cup semi-finals and finals. The stunning price includes a three-drink voucher for bottles of Budweiser or Corona or a glass of house wine - working out at \u00a380 a drink. But with the tiny nation preparing for the booziest event in its history, The Sun Online has put together the cheapest pub crawl possible in Qatar. Advertising itself as \"Doha's Retro American Diner & Sports Bar,\" Public House is based in the Marsa Malaz Kempinski Hotel on The Pearl, an artificial island in the Persian Gulf. A pint of Heineken will set you back 40 Qatari riyal (QR), or around \u00a39.50. A \"modern gastropub\", Mulberry Tavern is also based on Pearl Island in the Hilton Doha. A 500ml beer (a UK pint is 570ml) costs 61 QR (\u00a314.48). However, it does offer happy hours when draft Carlsberg, Stella and Heineken are a slightly more reasonable 39 QR (\u00a39.26). Happy hour is Monday from opening until midnight and Friday through Wednesday from opening until 8pm. Doha has a surprising number of Irish-themed pubs, including The Irish Harp, based in the Sheraton Grand Doha Resort & Convention Hotel. The pub offers a daily happy hour from 5-8pm, during which time Budweiser, Carlsberg, Guinness, Heineken, Hoegaarden, Leffe Blonde, and Stella all go for 38 QR (\u00a39.02). Making the bold claim to be \"the best sports bar in town,\" the Champions Sports Bar is rare for Qatar in being a bar not based inside a western hotel. Although during World Cup games, the \u00a3240 cost will put many off, the bar is slightly more reasonable outside of these hours. A draught Budweiser, Carlsberg, Guinness, Hoegaarden, or Stella costs between 34 and 37 QR (\u00a38.07-\u00a38.78). The Hangout Pub is located in Doha's Grand Regal Hotel, on the main road heading to Hamad International Airport. It also promises happy hours between 3 and 8pm, during which time pints of Heineken and Budweiser are 34 QR (\u00a38.07). Another \"Irish-themed\" pub, the Shamrock Tavern is based in Magnum Hotel in the West Bay area of Doha. During happy hour - Saturday to Thursday 12-8pm - beers are 30 percent off. Draught beer costs between 32-34 QR (\u00a37.60-\u00a38.07), making it the cheapest pint we found in Doha so far. Slightly off the beaten track in the outskirts of Doha, StrEAT Culture is based in the city's DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel. Beers are 45 QR (\u00a310.68), but the bar offers a daily happy hour between 5 and 8pm. It also offers a \"Ladies Night\" on Wednesday and Saturday between 8 and 11pm, during which time women can get unlimited refills on certain drinks for 69 QR (\u00a316.56). Also, unusually, the bar offers a \"Gents Night\" on Tuesday between 5pm and 1am, when men can buy one beer and get a second free. The Red Lion Pub is based in the Al Mansour Suites Hotel in the Al Mansoura region of southern Doha. Pints are between 49 and 52 QR (\u00a311.76-\u00a312.48), while homesick Brits can also order some pub grub staples. Bangers and mash or fish and chips will set you back 65 QR (\u00a315.60) each. Another hotel-based bar, the Hudson Tavern is based in the Mondrian in Doha on The Pearl development. Fish and chips cost 90 QR (\u00a321.37).

{"title": "Man Utd ratings: Maguire sluggish with World Cup around the corner while Fernandes shows why he\u2019s Red Devils\u2019 main man", "author": "Joshua Mbu", "date": "10 Nov 2022", "content": "MANCHESTER UNITED came from behind TWICE to beat Aston Villa 4-2 in the Carabao Cup. Ollie Watkins opened the scoring for the visitors, ghosting in behind   captain  . The striker, who missed out on England's   squad, lifted the ball over Martin Dubravka finishing off a well-worked move. However, it didn't take   long to draw level. Diogo Dalot found Bruno Fernandes in behind  's backline with a searching ball.  The Red Devils No8 then squared it to Anthony Martial, who tapped home from close range. The equaliser didn't deter Villa, who continued to press for a winner. And the restoration of their lead came through some good work by Leon Bailey, who forced Dalot to steer the ball into the back of his own net. Marcus Rashford then grabbed United's second equaliser of the night before Bruno Fernandes' deflected effort and Scott McTominay's added time goal sealed the win. Here's how SunSport's Joshua Mbu rated the Red Devils.  Didn't have much to do in the opening 45. Had no chance stopping Watkins' opener with the England striker getting his shot off unopposed. Chugged up and down the line, as per usual. Caught napping for Villa's goal and desperately tried to recover. Redeemed himself with a searching ball down the line to Fernandes for Martial's equaliser. But then shot himself in the foot by turning Villa's second into the back of his own net. Arrived late on Ollie Watkins just before half-time and picked up a booking. More minutes under his belt heading into the Qatar World Cup but his sluggish performance could be a cause for concern. Couldn't get near Watkins for Villa's goal. Should've scored a free header late on in the second half.  Didn't put a foot wrong in the first half.  Held his line well and wasn't at fault for the first goal, with that coming down Dalot and Maguire's side. Man Utd's biggest attacking threat in the first half. The flying Dutchman overlapped Rashford well but saw multiple crosses be blocked in the first half. A decent performance, putting his Europa League horrors behind him. Could start to push Luke Shaw for the starting spot again in the New Year. Stopped Douglas Luiz from opening the scoring, clearing the ball off the line from a direct corner in the first half. Picked up the first booking of the game, clattering United legend Ashley Young. Was the more defensive of the midfield pairing until Fred's substitution. Got forward in the latter stages and got his goal. Played a more advanced midfield role while McTominay did the sweeping.  Was slow to pick up Jacob Ramsey for Villa's opener. Focus has probably shifted to the World Cup, where Brazil are favourites.  Was subbed for Christian Eriksen. Played out wide to allow Van De Beek to play through the middle. Played some clever passes into Martial at times and got the assist for United's equaliser. Scored the winner with a deflected effort, proving why he's United's main man. Largely a passenger in the Red Devils team. Really struggling to impress, even under Erik ten Hag, who managed him at Ajax. Was subbed for Anthony Elanga. Relatively quiet night for Rashford, who received good news earlier on Thursday that he was heading to Qatar. Grabbed the equaliser after Villa made a mess of their defending. The Frenchman is just returning to fitness and struggled to make an impact in the opening 45. Got a goal on his return. Was subbed for Alejandro Garnacho with just under half an hour to go. Bright when he came on, proving he can compete against Premier League teams. Got the assist for McTominay's goal. Deserves more league minutes. Added some energy, which Van De Beek simply wasn't offering. Allowed United to play a lot wider. Added some much needed control to the midfield when he came on. Crisp passing kept United ticking. Didn't have much to do when coming on. His job was to keep it tight at the back and maintain United's lead - which he did."},

And while it can feel like the golden era of dramatic football has passed, respondents disagree. A quarter think iconic moments were more likely to be seen in the competition before the year 2000, while 22 per cent think football has become more exciting in the new millennium. Outside of the tournament, 24 per cent of football fans have witnessed an iconic moment on the pitch in-person, and 25 per cent have seen their national team play from the stands.

NHS bosses want to avoid a repeat of the coronavirus wave that followed last year\u2019s Euros. And yesterday two of England football\u2019s biggest names \u2014   and   \u2014 backed our Do The Double campaign. Millions of those eligible for jabs have not had them, with 13million in England due an   and 18million still due a flu vaccine. Medics fear a virus \u201ctwindemic\u201d could cripple hospitals this winter as they now face mass walkouts after the nurses\u2019 strike vote. Covid cases are falling, but experts predict a virus surge when fans start packing out pubs and living rooms to watch  \u2019s side take to the pitch in Qatar after the   begins on  . Match Of The Day host Gary, 61, who scored 48 goals for England, and World Cup winner Sir Geoff, 80, urged football fans to get jabbed. Former striker Gary, Mexico \u201986\u2019s top goalscorer, told The Sun: \u201cYou can\u2019t beat watching a World Cup with your friends and family, and no one wants that ruined by Covid.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had my booster jabs and I\u2019m getting my flu jab next week, and I urge anyone who is eligible to get theirs too. \u201cIf you can, do the double. Come on, England!\u201d \u00a0Sir Geoff, 80, whose hat-trick in the 1966 World Cup final saw England lift the trophy for the first and only time, said he backed our jabs push \u201cone million per cent\u201d.  He added: \u201cI am surprised when people say they are not going to get a Covid jab.\u00a0 \u201cEverybody at every level, at every age, should have the jab when they are due.\u201d Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, also called on Sun readers to get protected, whether they plan to watch at home or abroad. England\u2019s last major tournament, the Euros in 2021, saw Covid cases surge tenfold in a summer wave. Positive tests increased from 5,000 a day in the first week of June to 45,000 a day by July 15, just days after the Three Lions lost the final to Italy on penalties. A government report later said England\u2019s Euro fixtures had caused \u201cspikes in cases across the country\u201d. The Department of Health said many people who tested positive had been \u201cvisiting bars, pubs, other households and eating out\u201d on match days. Mild Omicron means Covid is less dangerous now but those who are infected still face watching games from their sickbed if they are not protected. Jabs will slash the risk of flu or Covid infection over winter but immunity can take weeks to kick in, with kick-off in Qatar in just nine days. Dr Paul Hunter, medicine professor at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cIt is important to get it done sooner rather than later. \u201cIf you have a jab now it would be very unlikely that you get infected during the World Cup or over Christmas. \u201cThe vaccines are now only being offered to more vulnerable and older people who might not have had Covid recently or have not had flu for two years. \u201cFor them, going to watch football in a crowded pub is a big risk factor for catching a virus.\u201d Around 33million people are eligible for a free flu vaccine and 26million can get an autumn Covid booster. Even so, only about half of the shots have been taken up so far, with 15million flu jabs dished out and 13.9million Covid top-ups. Figures show flu cases have risen in recent weeks and hospital flu admissions are above average from recent years. Although the autumn Covid wave has started to shrink, with a nine per cent drop in cases last week, there are still 1.6million people infected with the virus, including 5,647 in hospital. That\u2019s why it makes sense for all of us \u2014 footie fans or not \u2014 to Do The Double. NHS England says 33million people are eligible for a flu vaccine and 26million can get an autumn Covid booster.  Flu jabs and Covid boosters are both available for everyone aged over 50, under-50s with serious health conditions, pregnant women, care home residents, frontline health and care staff, carers and anyone living with a person with a weakened immune system.  Free flu vaccines are also on offer for children aged two to 11. \u00a0Anyone who has not had the first three Covid vaccines can book their next one at any time. Online at\u00a0 , by phoning 119 for free or by contacting your local pharmacy or GP surgery.\u00a0 Yes, both for eligible people. Those not eligible can pay for a flu jab from a high street pharmacy but it is not possible to buy a Covid-19 shot. Yes, many NHS sites are offering to do that. Studies have proven it is safe and effective to administer the two jabs together. It takes at least a week for a vaccine to work and up to three weeks for full protection. With the first game in Qatar just nine days away, sooner is better than later. WE know the World Cup will bring the whole country together, with millions gathering in pubs and front rooms to cheer on Gareth Southgate and his team. But we also know that crowds are what viruses like best, whether that is the common cold, flu or even Covid. So the best possible defence will be vital \u2013 not just in Qatar but also here at home. If you are eligible for a Covid or flu vaccination this autumn, make sure you are going into the tournament match fit by topping up your protection. With flu already circulating, and Covid never having gone away, there is a real threat of a \u201ctwindemic\u201d in what could be one of the toughest winters the NHS has faced. We are doing everything we can to prepare, including adding extra hospital beds, introducing a national falls service and rolling out data-driven \u201cwar rooms\u201d to co-ordinate care and make sure every spare bed is put to good use. We are also making it easier than ever for people to book Covid and flu jabs at more than 3,100 sites across the country, through the NHS website or by calling 119. They can save your life and keep you out of hospital. So don\u2019t score an own goal this World Cup. Take a shot for England so you can enjoy the football \u2013 along with Christmas and the New Year."},

The BBC is set to make most of the   they're showing available in   via the  , so all the more reason to get your TV settings right before November 20. You can do all sorts like select picture mode and change the brightness on most   sets. Here's what you should and should not do. Picture mode might be the obvious thing you want to change on your TV but don't be fooled. You may find it tucked within the TV's settings menu, though some have a button on the remote to access it. Picture mode is usually set to a default, but there are various options to suit different needs, such as movies. There is usually one called sport or something similar, but many telly experts recommend against it. It apparently makes things far too bright. There are a bunch of settings you can fiddle around with yourself on TVs these days. These include contrast and brightness - you'll find them on the TV settings menu. Optimising what you see really comes down to personal preference, there's no right or wrong. Contrast takes care of the bright bits of the image, while the brightness setting changes the dark areas. Making either of these too high or low won't offer the best result but a slight adjustment might do the trick. Sharpness is a funny one - it basically works as an edge enhancement but this can actually take away some of the finer detail. Try this on the lower side of the scale. Colour temperature will deal with how warm or cool you want the images to appear, so have a play around until it looks natural and - most importantly - pleasing on the eye. There are also some dynamic black and dynamic contrast options which are usually switched on automatically - turn them off and see if it makes things better.

His claim that his team\u2019s performance in Friday\u2019s 1-0 defeat was \u2018a step in the right direction\u2019 was an insult to the intelligence of anyone who watched it \u2014 especially the 4,300 paying punters up in the Gods at the San Siro. \n Southgate has made plenty of mentions of how previous England managers have suffered widespread criticism from supporters and the media. But in truth, he hasn\u2019t received nearly as much stick as most predecessors. He is England\u2019s most successful boss since Sir Alf Ramsey, having led the side to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the final of last year\u2019s Euros. And despite long-term criticism of his over-cautious approach, supporters have only truly turned on him since the debacle against Hungary \u2014 which was England\u2019s heaviest home defeat for nearly a century. When you consider that Bobby Robson was on the receiving end of \u2018In the Name of God, Go!\u2019 headlines, that Graham Taylor was consigned to the vegetable patch and caricatured as a turnip, and that Kevin Keegan quit in a Wembley toilet, Southgate has not had it so bad. Yet it seems the nation has grown bored of him and that Southgate may be growing tired of the job. The 52-year-old has not managed a club for 13 years now and is keen to do so. Walter Winterbottom is the only England manager to have ever taken the side to four major\u00a0 tournament finals and this will be Southgate\u2019s third. This job, which was never quite the \u2018impossible job\u2019, does carry a shelf-life, and the current boss is reaching his. Not that the FA have any obvious successor to call on now that Graham Potter has hitched up with Chelsea. Southgate became a national treasure and a style icon in Russia four years ago, a status which he always felt embarrassed about. And he is adamant that he is not bothered by either personal popularity or antipathy. Southgate said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen every other England manager have it (unpopularity). So I wasn\u2019t and never have been carried away by praise. I know how the game is and it turns so quickly and you\u2019re judged by results. \u201cNobody is going to enjoy being booed by the supporters but I understand the job. \u201cFootball management, whenever you have a difficult run of results, it\u2019s always going to be the manager who deals with that. I\u2019ve got to get on with it.\u201d Southgate is a results-driven manager who is no longer getting results. His side have always been over-reliant on the goals of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling, while their potency from set-pieces has evaporated. But suggestions that the manager is wasting a new \u2018golden generation\u2019 are wide of the mark. England are short of talent in central defence, central midfield and at left-back. The manager believes, correctly, that England are not good enough to be successful by playing gung-ho football and he is going back to a 3-4-3 formation, which is always met with accusations of over-caution. Yet we can only hope that his delusional talk of promising performances are not repeated in the dressing room, where some home truths need to be told if England are to avoid an early exit in Qatar. Southgate claimed: \u201cI don\u2019t think the performance against Italy was far off. \u201cI know that\u2019s going to get derision because we\u2019re on the back of a run of defeats but the players know in the main the performance was good. \u201cI\u2019ll ultimately be judged on the tournament and how we do in the tournaments. \u201cWould we have preferred a different run of results? Without a doubt. We\u2019d like to be scoring goals freely, we\u2019d like to be winning, but this is a different test and we\u2019ve got to show we\u2019re resilient enough to deal with that.\u201d"},

They were booed off the park by the England fans in the San Siro, and a Sun Twitter poll   before the World Cup starts in 56 days' time. Southgate's side will now be relegated from League A of the Nations League so will play against weaker nations in 2024. But it's the\u00a0  that's the major concern, with England's first game   on November 21. Southgate is facing a desert storm of problems ahead of his trip to Qatar. They have gone into reverse since losing the Euros finals on penalties a year ago. Here are five key issues he must fix between now and then. England went with their tried and tested back five against Italy, with three centre-backs in Kyle Walker,   and Eric Dier. This means fewer places for creative players, and perhaps helps explain England's current goal drought. Southgate is naturally cautious, so he's unlikely to change formations so close to the tournament. But his desire to keep it tight at the back limits England's options in attack. They have not scored from open play for 450 minutes now, despite having so many options in attack. Gary  for leaving  on the bench against Italy, claiming he's the most creative player England have. Several of Southgate's key performers in recent tournaments are struggling at club level this season. Top of the list is Harry Maguire, who was picked in the starting XI in Milan despite just five appearances for Man Utd this season. At left back, Ben Chilwell and Luke Shaw are out of their respective teams at Chelsea and United, meaning Bukayo Saka was crow-barred into the side against Italy as left wing-back. Mason Mount's form at Chelsea has fallen off a cliff, while Raheem Sterling is finding his feet at the club following his summer transfer. Kalvin Phillips has hardly played since he moved to Man City. Southgate has to decide which trusted players to stick with, and which ones to ditch for players in better form. England looked stale in attack, with Harry Kane in the middle, and Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden either side of him. Kane has 50 goals for his country, but was denied service in Italy and was forced to drop deeper. England don't have a Plan B if it's not working with Kane, with Ivan Toney and Tammy Abraham too inexperienced at this level. Marcus Rashford's timely return to form at Man Utd will at least give Southgate another option. It's a pity he picked up a muscle injury and missed meeting up with the squad. Saka is one of England's brightest talents, but he spent much of the game on defensive duties. Jude Bellingham too was shackled in midfield. The teenager needs to be give more freedom to attack and impose himself on the game. Phil Foden has become a key figure for Pep Guardiola at Man City, but Southgate has yet to work out how to get the best out of him at international level. Southgate has been brilliant at getting fans on his side since he took the job in 2016. However he was booed off the pitch at Molineux after a 4-0 home defeat to Hungary. And he was greeted with more abuse when he went over to salute the 4,000 travelling supporters in the San Siro on Friday. Afterwards he said: \"I understand the reaction at the end because of the results we've had in this competition. It is an understandable emotional reaction.\" Southgate needs to flip the mood. Victory over   at Wembley on Monday in their final game before Qatar would do much to lift the gloom."},

Figures show soccer stadiums become sex assault hotspots when booze-fuelled crowds flock to big games during tournaments. But thousands of women fans expected to travel to the   Gulf State in November have been warned they face prosecution if they report offences. \u2019s strict Islamic code outlaws all sexual contact between unmarried couples - making it an offence even if the woman has not consented. Around 100 prosecutions a year have been recorded under the strict \u201czina\u201d laws banning sex and pregnancy outside of marriage. And even rape victims have been prosecuted after suspects claimed sex was consensual - and handed sentences ranging from seven years jail to flogging with a whip or stick. In 2016 a 22-year-old Dutch woman, named only as Laura, was convicted of extra-marital sex, fined \u00a3580 and given a one-year suspended sentence after reporting a brutal rape. She was drugged in a nightclub in Qatar before being sexually assaulted - but was arrested immediately when she repotred the incident. Qatar is more strict than neighbouring Arab state   where A British tourist who reported being raped by two men was charged with having extra-marital sex in 2016. The woman, who is in her 20s, reported the \"brutal and violent\" attack by two   men who filmed it. But police immediately arrested her, confiscated her passport and charged him with having sex outside marriage - forcing her to crowdfund legal fees before the case was dropped. Radha Stirling, founder and director of the Detained in Dubai legal aid group - which has launched an app to help World Cup fans in trouble said: \"The UAE has a long history of penalising rape victims. \"It is still not safe for victims to report these crimes to the police without the risk of suffering a double punishment. \u201cBut Qatar has not acclimated itself as a tourist destination and is even less tolerant than Dubai. \u201cThey will be flooded with more tourists in a matter of weeks than they usually get in half a year during the World Cup.\u00a0 There is inevitably going to be some culture shock. \"It is still not safe for victims to report these crimes to the police without the risk of suffering a double punishment. \u201cVictims go to them expecting justice and end up being prosecuted. Police not only invalidate their victimisation - they punish them for it.\" May Romanos, a Middle East and North Africa expert from Amnesty International added: \u201cYou go to the police, and instead of being the victim, you become the accused.\u201d Before it landed the World Cup 12 years ago, Qatar - a tiny Gulf state the size of Yorkshire - published figures which showed around 100 prosecutions for sex outside marriage. The statistics are no longer public as the oil-rich emirate has scrubbed up it image for the soccer showpiece. But legal experts warned that yesterday that survivors of sexual violence could even be unable to access basic health services, such as emergency contraception, without a marriage certificate. Analysis has revealed that sexual offence figure rocket whenever sporting events are staged. In the London borough of Brent, which includes Wembley, 72 sex attacks were reported in July last year when the Euro 2020 semis and finals were played - the highest figure in five years. In the Spanish city of Seville, which hosted four games in June 2021, 39 cases of sexual violence were reported - 70 per cent higher than any other June on record. Qatar\u2019s supreme committee, which oversees the whole World Cup denied local laws on sex outside marriage would be an issue. A spokesman said: \u201cQatar protects and promotes the rights of women, and this extends to all women visiting for the World Cup\u201d. A FIFA spokesman added: \u201cAny fan who reports a sexual assault will have access to Qatar\u2019s high-quality healthcare system irrespective of marital status\u201d."},

Across a range of different sports, athletes are making extraordinary amounts of money even though they are still at a fairly early stage of their career.  Whether they are at the top of their field in tennis, basketball or motorsports, athletes 26 years old and under are raking in the cash from a young age.

The   ace Josh Allen might not be the most-well known name to those who don't follow American sports.

Allen makes $63million - or \u00a355m - in on-field earnings after putting pen to paper on his new deal.  His breakout season came in 2020 when he led the Bills to their first division title and playoff victory since 1995, and he hasn't looked back since.

Unlike Allen however, the vast majority of the Japanese star's earnings come from her off-the-field endorsements.  The tennis ace has more than 20 corporate partners, including Nike, Mastercard and Louis Vuitton which helps her to bring in \u00a350.7m.

The Red Bull driver was the youngest driver in the sport's history when he made he debut at 17, before winning his first race at 18.  It's a good time to be a young football player called Kylian Mbappe.  The PSG star stunned the footballing world earlier this year when he snubbed Real Madrid and instead   to keep him in France.  The 23-year-old now makes around \u00a324.5m in on-field earnings and around \u00a313m in endorsement deals, with agreements with EA Sports and Nike keeping Mbappe's accountants busy.

{"title": "Why are England wearing red against Germany and what is the kit clash rule at the World Cup?", "author": "Alex Terrell", "date": "26 Sep 2022", "content": "ENGLAND famously beat West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final wearing a red kit. The iconic image of   smashing the ball past Hans Tilkowski to clinch the Jules Rimet trophy is seared into every Three Lions fan's mind. But there is a far more 21st-century reason why   at Wembley, in their final match before the Qatar World Cup. Quite simply, the Three Lions want to promote their new   change strip. Therefore they will wear their new Nike kit ahead of tonight's Nations League finale against Germany. Despite being the home team, the home side have opted to wear red at Wembley. The jersey retails at an eyewatering \u00a374.99 and Gareth Southgate's side may wear the kit against either Iran or USA in World Cup group B. Wales play in red, so it is likely the two sides will play in their home kit in the final fixture of the group stages. There are two tiers of pricing for England's World Cup kits. The fans' kit is about \u00a375 from various different retailers. England also have a 'stadium' version of the kit, which costs a staggering \u00a3105. What are the rules on home and away teams wearing kits at the World Cup? There are some extremely extensive rules about who wears what at World Cup matches. The designated home side always takes precedence, though they can be made to alter the colour of their shorts if necessary. This is what section 24 of the Fifa guidelines has to say on the matter: \"Each team shall inform Fifa of two different and contrasting colours (one predominately dark and one predominately light kit) for its official and reserve team kit (shirt, shorts and socks). Only these colours may be worn at the matches. \u201cIn principle, each team shall wear its official team kit as declared on the team colour form.  \"If the two teams\u2019 colours might cause confusion, the host team shall be entitled to wear its official team kit and the visiting team shall use its reserve team kit or, if necessary, a combination of the official and the reserve team kits.\u201d"},
{"title": "England\u2019s best players who missed out on playing in major tournaments including Le Tissier, Merson and Gazza", "author": "Jon Boon", "date": "26 Sep 2022", "content": "There is often an eyebrow or two raised when the squad is finally announced ahead of a   or  . Last year it was Jesse Lingard who missed out on making Gareth  's final 26-man squad for Euro 2020, and it appears Marcus Rashford,  and Jadon Sancho are   ahead of the World Cup in Qatar. Here's seven more stars that could've counted themselves unlucky at the time to miss out. In 2012, aged 33, it's fair to say Rio was past the peak of his powers. However, he did still offer a wise and experienced head at the back, and had come off a decent season for  . But Ferdinand was left \"gutted\" to have been left out of  's Euro 2012 squad. Manager Roy Hodgson explained the decision was made for footballing reasons, but Ferdinand's omission did avoid any potential conflict with the selected  , who months later faced allegations in court that he racially abused Rio's brother, Anton. \"I admire  ,\" Hodgson explained. \"I think he's a fine footballer and I respect him, but I had to pick a squad with defenders I wanted to take to the Euros.\" Phil Jones and Joleon Lescott got nods ahead of Ferdinand. Ex-England boss Glenn Hoddle once described it as the \"saddest thing he ever had to do.\" After   in helping his country in the qualifiers, he was told he wouldn't be going to France '98. The hero two years earlier at Euro '96, Gascoigne was given an ultimatum about his fitness. But Hoddle felt he just wasn't up to it. According to reports, Gazza smashed up Hoddle's hotel room when he was told the news. The mercurial midfielder was never picked for England again. Although Merse got the nod ahead of Gazza for France '98, he could count himself unlucky not to have gone to Italia '90. In fine fine form at Arsenal, and only 22,   won the PFA Young Player of the Year Award in 1989. But Bobby Robson only picked three forwards for the World Cup, with the striking positions being taken by Gary Lineker, Peter Beardsley and Steve Bull. Nine midfielders were selected, including a relatively unknown Gazza and Bryan Robson, who struggled with injury and missed the majority of the competition. Arguably the most talented footballer of his generation, it's criminal   didn't get the international recognition he deserved. Possibly because he played for an unfashionable club in Southampton at the time - that might've been why he was overlooked. But the Saints legend only managed eight caps in his career, despite scoring 209 goals for his club. Had England qualified for the 1994 World Cup, he might've had a chance of being selected. He was also overlooked for the 1998 World Cup, even after impressing in an England B game against Russia - scoring a hat-trick. Experience, perhaps, wasn't on Mr Arsenal's side when Bobby Robson was selecting his Italia '90 squad. And the formation wouldn't have been to the Gunners legend's strengths - playing in a back three, when he was used to a flat back four in North London. Adams' spot went to Mark Wright, a more cultured sweeper who could bring the ball out of defence better than his counterpart. At Euro '92, Martin Keown and Des Walker were the preferred two. However, Adams was restored to the first team before Euro '96, where he had an outstanding tournament. In 2014, it was a close call in the striking positions for a partner for Wayne Rooney. In fairness to Roy Hodgson, Jermain Defoe didn't do himself any favours by moving to the MLS to play for Toronto months before the squad was decided. Rickie Lambert, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge were picked instead, leaving Defoe devastated. \"I don't think I'll ever be at peace [with the decision],\" the striker said at the time. Good enough for Real Madrid, but not for England. Winger Laurie Cunningham, whose life was tragically cut short at 33 in a car crash, joined Los Blancos after starring at West Brom for \u00a3950,000 in 1979. In doing so, he became the first British footballer to move to the LaLiga giants. However, Ron Greenwood completely snubbed him from his Euro 1980 squad. The following season, Cunningham made the squad for the qualifiers, after bitter negotiations with Real Madrid. But after appearing as a sub in a 2-1 defeat to Romania, he would never wear an England jersey again."},

He said: \"If I came back, it would come for free, so I'm sure it would be viable. In any case, it's a technical and player decision.\" It is understood PSG want to retain the star forward by offering him a one-year extension, but they are yet to officially make the offer. Romeu later elaborated on how the structure of the club has changed both on and off the pitch and how this will accommodate Messi's return. He said: \"We have completely changed the structure.  \"From having players with salary levels outside the market and an already large squad at the average age level, we have gone on to have players with projection and market levels, which will surely be important. \"Without sounding presumptuous, we have saved Barca but we are not financially healthy and a lot of austerity and rigour are needed and there is a lot of work to do.  \"Bar\u00e7a will be healthy in five years. In the 2024-25 season we will be at the level that belongs to us.\" He went on to reveal the club have cut \u00a3135million from their salary bill."},

Although there may be some anxious waiting by the phone in the coming weeks, his agents feel he should be included in the final squad for Qatar. Jesus\u2019 last goal for his country was back in June, coming off the bench in a friendly against South Korea before netting in injury time in a 5-1 win. Jesus is not the only Gunners player not to be selected in Tite\u2019s squad this month, with Gabriel Martinelli and defender Gabriel Magalhaes also deemed surplus to requirements.

He resigned from the post with Discover Qatar, part of Qatar Airways, in October 2019 and was accused of sending \"highly confidential documents\" to an external email address. Mr Bennett was arrested at the offices of his employer and taken away blindfolded and in handcuffs. He later told how he was held for three weeks after being stripped of his clothes, hit against walls, blasted with high-pressure hoses and subjected to sleep deprivation techniques. According to one of Mr Bennett's former colleagues, his resignation had been viewed as a \"massive insult\", reports  Lawyers from the United Nations said there have been \"credible allegations\" of ill-treatment where Mr Bennett was detained. Ten weeks after his arrest, Mr Bennett -  a former director at Tui and Thomas Cook - was found hanged at the Curve Hotel in Doha on Christmas Day 2019. Qatari authorities ruled his death as suicide, but a coroner in the UK ruled there was \"no specific evidence of suicidal intent\". The Brit coroner added that the \"circumstances of the months leading up to his death remain unclear\". He did not leave a suicide note and the night before he died he had been \"laughing and joking\" on a video call with his wife and kids. Nancy Bennett, Mr Bennett's widow, told The Times: \u201cThere are so many questions. He left here with the whole world ahead of him.\u201d Mr Bennett's case was closed last September, a week after now Prime Minister Liz Truss became foreign secretary - despite being aware of concerns from the coroner and his family.

We are the working class. We are always written off. We are never spoken about in the same way as London or Manchester. So, when you have a local lad like  , who has come through the system, done everything the right way and then gone on to do what he has done, scoring in the Champions League and starring for England at 19, it is special. He really is the pride of the city. It is what the local kids will aspire to be like, even my 13-year-old son. If he was to be around Jude for more than three minutes, he would probably pass out. It is just a testament to the whole family, including his 17- year-old brother Jobe who I play with currently at the Blues. Really solid people and great individuals. His mum and dad have managed to create two young, not only great footballers for club and country in the Under-18s and senior team, but wonderful human beings as well. When Jude\u2019s No\u200a22 was retired after he left Birmingham for  , the club was a laughing stock, but now look. Everyone is going: \u201cThis guy is unbelievable.\u201d I already think he is a superstar. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was the face of the FIFA game next year and I think he will be England captain in three to four years\u2019 time. And when he is at the World Cup in\u00a0Qatar, and all the eyes are on him, he is only going to play better. The deeper the water, the better he swims. We will all be going: \u201cOh my God, look at this talent.\u201d It could be similar to how the likes of Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen burst on to the global stage with  . This has always been in the pipeline for Jude, and this is what he has been working towards for years. You don\u2019t just get there by mistake or luck. So, once it becomes reality, you aren\u2019t fazed by anything. This was all a part of the master plan. I already think he is a superstar. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was the face of the FIFA game next year and I think he will be England captain in three to four years\u2019 time. His parents have kept him level and grounded, but at the same time he isn\u2019t a robot, he isn\u2019t stiff. He gives you a bit in interviews but he has never forgotten who he is and where he comes from. He is still humble enough to come back to Birmingham, to speak about the city and the role certain players had on him. Sometimes you just have to sit back and clap. I am someone who likes to give people their flowers while they are alive. That family is special and as a parent, I would like to be like their parents. It is a pleasure to be around them. There are no doubts in that young man\u2019s head. He has an unwavering belief and I see that come out on the pitch. I studied him in the Germany game, and when England were 2-0 down, he was the one driving people forward, going to press. The word to describe his performance is \u2018flawless\u2019. There is just something different in the way he\u00a0 carries himself. He demands the best\u00a0 but can do it with a smile. In my day and before, captains would be barking and screaming but these guys can do that with a laugh and a smile at the same time. From what I have been told, he has been like this since he was 16, driving games, being a real positive presence off the pitch. He will be getting linked with massive clubs now. His family are very methodical, so they will sit down and think about the pros and cons for each move but Jude will have his mind made up already. He doesn\u2019t have the mindset of wanting to sit and have a few more years development but I don\u2019t see   as the move. I can see why he would play there and why it would work but I have just a feeling that Spanish football will suit him. If   come in, I can\u2019t see him turning that down."},

Mikel Arteta gave a rousing half-time team talk after  's late equaliser before the break. And the Gunners restored their lead with Gabriel Jesus tapping home following a parry by   captain Hugo Lloris. A red card for Emerson Royal sealed Spurs' fate. Arsenal then grabbed a third through fan favourite  . The Swiss midfielders redemption story at the Emirates continues. Spurs' away end was emptied at the sight of Arsenal's third, and the Gunners announced themselves as unlikely rivals to  's   crown with a  . Here's how SunSport rated Arteta's men. Wasn't called into action much with most of the football being played in the opposite half. Could do nothing about Harry Kane's equaliser from the penalty spot. Distribution was solid.  Played a peach of a pass out wide to Gabriel Martinelli to keep the pressure on Spurs in the early stages of the match. Was unlucky not to be called up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for September's fixtures. And again showed he's a solid option ahead of the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Solid in a tackle and composed on the ball. Picked up an assist for Thomas Partey's opener. Also playing a right-back and not in his natural position at centre-back. The Frenchman continued to cement his place in Arsenal's starting line-up. Was quick to sniff out any danger - especially with balls in behind the backline. Gave away the penalty for Kane's equaliser. But apart from that, it was another solid display from the Brazil centre-back. Arteta will be encouraged by his form alongside Saliba. A relatively quiet afternoon for the left-back. He was clearly instructed not to get too far forward out of fear of being caught on the break. Linked up well with Martinelli at times. No Thomas, no Partey. What a goal from the Arsenal midfielder to open the scoring. He opened up his body and curled his effort into the top right corner to send the Emirates into pandemonium.  Defensively sound and accurate in possession. The Swiss hard man is just the type of player you need in these kind of games. He didn't give his Spurs counterparts a moments peace in the middle of the park. Was rewarded with a goal in the second half to make it 3-1. Granit Xhaka's redemption story with the Arsenal faithful is one that will go down in history. The 21-year-old was a thorn in Germany's side for England on Monday. And he continued tormenting his opposition on Saturday. Every time he got on the ball, he had Ivan Perisic and/or Clement Lenglet desperately backtracking. Doesn't give the opposition a moments peace - exactly how it should be when playing on the wing. His shot played a role in Gabriel Jesus' early second half strike. Makes Arsenal tick. He's the conductor.  Before he even got his foot on the ball, he knew EXACTLY where he wanted it to go. Creative in the final third, always looking to play team-mates in on goal.  Another key component of Arteta's hard-working front line. Sent out to be a nuisance and he did just that. Quick and inventive when he needed to be and got an assist as a result. Been a breath of fresh air since joining from Manchester City in the summer. The Brazilian is important to building Arsenal's attacks and is more than comfortable playing with his back to goal.  Compliments Odegaard and Co well. Got his goal early on in the second half, tapping home from close range after Hugo Lloris parried the initial effort. Brought on after Xhaka's third. Kept it tight to see out the result. The game was already put to bed before his arrival. The Scotland international showed some good touches down the left flank. The Portugal star got his first taste of a North London Derby. There was no pressure on him with the result already in the bag. The young striker was given a short cameo to impress. Not much action in the final stages of the game."},

With Harry Maguire\u2019s confidence\u00a0shot, I\u2019m selecting Eric Dier alongside John Stones. Southgate will stick with his 5-2-3, though \u2014 which means Mason Mount may miss out in the November 21 opener against Iran. There\u2019s no   or Trent Alexander-Arnold in my squad but I\u2019d pick James Maddison.

Pickford; Walker, Stones, Dier, Shaw; Rice, Mount, Bellingham; Saka, Kane, Sterling (4-3-3) \n SOUTHGATE should stick with a back three even though it is unpopular. The only way to progress at a World Cup is by being cautious rather than gung-ho. Despite his talent, Phil Foden is not doing enough to get into the starting XI. The squad pretty much picks itself. But there is no room for  , Jadon Sancho or Conor Coady.  Pickford, Pope, Ramsdale, Walker, James, Trippier, White, Maguire, Tomori, Dier, Chilwell, Shaw, Bellingham, Rice, J Henderson, Ward-Prowse, Phillips, Mount, Abraham, Bowen, Foden, Grealish, Kane, Saka, Sterling, Toney.  Pickford; Stones, Dier, Maguire; Trippier, Bellingham, Rice, Shaw; Saka, Kane, Sterling (3-4-3) ENGLAND need to take risks and play with the handbrake off in Qatar, so four at the back and an extra attacking player. Fikayo Tomori replaces Harry Maguire at centre-half and\u00a0Mason Mount gets the nod over Phil Foden who has not really done it for England yet.\u00a0Trent Alexander-Arnold is unlucky not to get in, while James Ward-Prowse makes the cut for his free-kick ability. Pickford, Ramsdale, D Henderson, James, Trippier, Walker, Stones, White, Maguire, Dier, Tomori, Shaw, Chilwell, Rice, Bellingham, Phillips, Ward-Prowse,\u00a0 J Henderson, Sterling, Saka, Mount, Foden, Kane, Rashford, Grealish, Calvert-Lewin. Pickford; James, Stones, Tomori, Shaw; Mount, Rice, Bellingham; Saka, Kane, Sterling (4-3-3) JACK GREALISH would be the main man for most countries, and an attacking midfield trio alongside Raheem Sterling and\u00a0Phil Foden would be as good as any. Striker Tammy Abraham has proved\u00a0himself at Roma and gets in the squad\u00a0ahead of Ivan Toney and Ollie Watkins.  Pickford, D Henderson, Ramsdale, James, Stones, Dier, Shaw, Maguire, Chilwell, Walker, Trippier, Tarkowski, Guehi, Bellingham, Rice, Foden, Grealish, Mount, Maddison, Saka, J Henderson, Kane, Rashford, Sancho, Sterling, Abraham. Pickford; James; Stones, Dier, Shaw; Bellingham, Rice; Sterling, Grealish, Foden; Kane (4-2-3-1) BUKAYO SAKA proved in 25 minutes against Germany why he has to start against Iran. But there has to be a casualty\u00a0and for me that is\u00a0Raheem Sterling. Tyrick Mitchell is my wildcard at left wing-back so no squad place for Luke Shaw. Marcus\u00a0Rashford, if fit, travels but not Jadon Sancho. Pickford, Ramsdale, Pope, Walker, Stones, Dier, Tomori, Maguire, Guehi, James, Alexander-Arnold, Trippier, Mitchell, Chilwell, Rice, Bellingham, J Henderson, Ward-Prowse, Saka, Foden, Grealish, Mount, Sterling, Kane, Rashford, Abraham.  Pickford; Stones, Dier, Tomori; James, Rice, Bellingham, Mitchell; Saka, Kane, Foden (3-4-2-1) AARON RAMSDALE is our most complete goalkeeper. Clubmate Ben White adds mobility to the defence in front of him. Getting the best out of Foden and Jude Bellingham will be crucial. Why Southgate has overlooked Lewis Dunk is anyone\u2019s guess, he has been Brighton\u2019s best player. Pickford, Ramsdale, Pope, James, Walker, Alexander-Arnold, Chilwell, Shaw, Stones, Dier, Dunk, White, Tomori, Rice, Bellingham, J Henderson, Ward-Prowse, Mount, Saka, Sterling, Grealish, Foden, Sancho, Rashford, Kane, Abraham. Ramsdale; James, White, Stones, Chilwell; Rice, Bellingham, Foden; Saka, Kane, Sterling (4-3-3) NO way Maguire makes the starting XI \u2014 he is a walking disaster. Having four at the back will allow the midfield three, Mount especially, to venture forward more. Saka must be a shoo-in for his attacking threat. Alexander-Arnold, who has the X-factor the squad could need, goes ahead of Trippier.

Ahead of the upcoming Qatar   in November,   around the globe.  Many players never get to experience a World Cup tournament throughout their careers.  However, some get their chance to shine at an extremely young age.  And thanks to research from  , the youngest five of these have been revealed.  Below SunSport will take you through this esteemed list.  One of the most iconic footballers of all time kicks off the list, with the   legend making his World Cup debut at the age of 17 years and 234 days old and still holds a number of records even to this day. Pele is the only player to have won three World Cups, doing so in 1958, 1962 and 1970 and still holds the record for assists (10) and joint-most final goals (3). The 81-year-old scored 12 times in 14 World Cup games, placing him at number five in the all-time standings for goalscorers at the tournament. The next man on the list, Salomon Olembe, first appeared for Cameroon at the 1998 World Cup at the age of 17 years and 184 days old.  Olembe registered an assist in his first-ever game in a 1-0 win over Burkina Faso but the 98' tournament would prove to be his most successful.  Femi Opabunmi overtook Olembe at the next World Cup, making his debut against England at the age of 17 years and 100 days old in 2002. During the early stages of his career, he had courted interest from the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal, but within four years of his World Cup debut he was forced to retire after suffering from glaucoma which left him blind in one eye. Samuel Eto\u2019o made his first appearance on the World Cup stage six days before compatriot Olembe managed his own, at the age of 17 years and 98 days. The iconic forward would go on to appear at four World Cups for his nation, scoring three goals in eight games.  And while the World Cup never fostered better than a group stage exit for the Indomitable Lions with Eto'o present, he did help his nation win an Olympic Gold medal and two African Cup of Nations. And finally, the youngest player to ever appear at the World Cup is Northern Irishman Norman Whiteside, who drew comparisons with George Best before injuries curtailed his career. The former Manchester United star made his World Cup bow against Yugoslavia in 1982 at the age of 17 years and 40 days old. While his solitary goal at the World Cup didn't arrive until the 1986 tournament, he did become the youngest ever player to receive a booking in World Cup history on his debut."},

A rousing half-time team talk by Arteta saw the Gunners start the second half how they started the first. Gabriel Jesus continued to show why Arsenal splashed the cash on him in the summer, restoring the lead with a close range strike. Watching Arsenal zip the ball across the pitch was undoubtedly a painful sight for Tottenham's fans and players. So painful Emerson Royal decided to leave a mark on a rival with a rash challenge, resulting in a red card and all but putting the game to bed. Did Arsenal take their foot off the gas? No. They went in search of a third to finish Spurs off and it came through fan favourite Granit Xhaka, who has gone from zero to hero under Arteta. The result didn't just to remind Tottenham, whose fans streamed out of the away end at the sight of Arsenal's third, that North London was red, it was also to put their other Prem rivals on notice of their wider ambitions. Arsenal have taken an astonishing 21 points from an available 24. And with usual title contenders Liverpool and Chelsea getting off to a slow start, Arteta and his young, exciting and free-scoring team will fancy themselves of pushing champions City, especially if they're still purring heading into the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

But the horrors the ex-  striker witnessed on two fundraising trips back to his decimated homeland since the Russian invasion have fuelled his desire to make a stand. The places he grew up as a kid - Kyiv, Irpin, Dnipro - have been mutilated by rockets and bombs. \u201cI have seen the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is war. It\u2019s something you have to see with your own eyes. It\u2019s not a movie. It\u2019s real life. \u201cWhen you see the places from your childhood hit by rockets, buildings destroyed by fire, it does something to you. \u201cOn my second visit, I saw Irpin. This once beautiful city, full of new buildings, now, there\u2019s nothing. Black. Flattened. Destroyed.\u201d It was the same in Borodyanka, Bucha and Hostomel. \u201cIn Dnipro,\u201d he added, \u201cI went to the children\u2019s wards of the hospital and saw boys and girls as young as six with terrible injuries. \u201cI heard the stories of the bombs that had hit their homes and taken their legs, their arms, their families. \u201cI went from one room to another and another and another. \u201cHonestly, after the second room, I didn\u2019t want to continue. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. It was too much sadness.\u201d Shevchenko, who spent three years at Stamford Bridge between 2006-2009, has enlisted the help of Barcelona\u2019s Poland striker   and his compatriot, world No.1 tennis star  . Together, with the Laureus Sport organisation, they are aiding Ukrainian refugees in the Polish city of Krakow. Shevchenko, 46, has gifted Lewandowski a Ukrainian captain\u2019s armband that he will take with him to the Qatar World Cup. \u201cSport has the ability to influence opinion and even policy when it comes to this war,\u201d Shevchenko added. \u201cIn these times, sport really does have the power to change the world.\u201d Shevchenko is also trying to rebuild Irpin\u2019s blitzed football pitches. \u201cThe city used to have this beautiful football stadium, as well as a new academy with artificial pitches,\u201d he told the Players\u2019 Tribune. \u201cAfter the bombing, only one pitch has been left untouched. \u201cI have spoken to the mayor about a fundraising initiative to rebuild the rest, but for now they remain full of craters, rubble and shrapnel. \u201cDespite everything, I saw children out there kicking a ball around. \u201cThose kids should never have to live through what they have, or to play in those conditions. It\u2019s no place for children. \u201cBut still they are there. Still resisting. That is the spirit of Ukraine.\u201d As a nine-year-old kid, he was evacuated from Kyiv following the shocking 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. \u201cMy dad took a Geiger counter to one of the footballs I brought with me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd it showed 50 times the normal radiation.

I cannot find the reason. I cannot explain it to my kids, or to any sensible human being. \u201cThe situation is critical. There are so many families living in overcrowded, temporary accommodations without access to basic services. And soon it will be winter. \u201cWe need to keep fundraising.

Preparation has proved a challenge for many nations and, with the final games before the tournament begins out the way, all we can do now is wait. England's form may have been concerning but it is a pattern repeated across a number of top nations. The struggles of some of the best ahead of Qatar could well make 2022 one of the most open World Cup's we've seen for some time. SunSport runs you through the runners and riders away from the home nations\u2026 They might be the holders, but France hardly arrive fighting fit for the defence of their crown. Pressure is building on Didier Deschamps after just one win from six Nations League games. Any side with   must be considered amongst the favourites but the PSG star is prone to fall-outs, which could once more be the undoing of this combustible France squad at a major tournament. It is also a guessing game as to whether   will be ready to go or not. The midfielder is set to return from a knee injury just days before the start of the World Cup. Tite's side steamrolled their way through qualifying without losing a single match and have been thumping opponents with ease in recent weeks. Brazil could even afford to leave Gabriel Jesus at home for the last international break before the tournament, while   will be powered on by the chance to break Pele's Brazilian goalscoring record with just two more strikes. Louis Van Gaal is back for one final tilt at the  . His Dutch side are the only European team to go unbeaten since Euro 2020 so arrive in fine fettle. Despite an array of talent their bid could be undone by key men enduring rough starts to the season. Virgil van Dijk has admitted he is struggling for top form while Matthijs de Ligt has lost his place in the side and Georgino Wijnaldum fractured his leg last month. There could hardly be a more romantic winner than Argentina. Qatar will be  i's last dance at a World Cup as he chases the one title to have eluded his glittering career. The PSG star now has a far stronger squad to lean on too with Cristian Romero, Lisandro Martinez and Lautauro Martinez all having seriously established themselves since the 2018 World Cup. Ahead of every recent tournament, Belgium have been backed to finally seal a trophy for their golden generation. There is every chance that this time it is just too late. The individual talent in Roberto Martinez's squad is undeniable but the knees of many stars are already starting to creak, with a defence still including Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld. They won't lack for experience, but they may struggle to keep up. Despite their middling   form, Germany qualified for the World Cup at a canter and cannot be written off. As he looks to address a recent slump at major tournaments - they didn't make it out of the group in Russia - Hansi Flick is creating a sharp side. He can still call on the old guard with experience of winning the World Cup, while adding in the spark from the likes of Jamal Musiala. Any injury to Joshua Kimmich could, however, be disastrous. Spain are on the way back up on the global stage. They've not made it past the last-16 at a World Cup since winning it 12 years ago but a place in the last four at Euro 2020 was a sure sign of progress. Finalists in the Nations League next year after beating Portugal this week, Luis Enrique's squad arrive on a high with a superb smattering of young stars to call upon. A manager blindly defending a Manchester United man who isn't getting minutes with his club but is untouchable with his country sounds familiar, doesn't it? and Harry Maguire may have to support one another in the weeks before Qatar. Boss Fernando Santos is sticking by his talisman amid calls to drop him from the side after poor performances and a belief that he does not fit in with how Portugal want to play. It's set up nicely for a turbo tantrum from Ron in the Middle East. Semi-finalists at Euro 2021 after Christian Eriksen's tragic collapse in their opening game, Denmark are a force to be reckoned with. They won nine out of their ten qualifiers to reach Qatar and with Eriksen back playing and shining at Manchester United could be even stronger this winter.  (Ts&Cs apply)"},

I had asked as only a day before President Raisi had cancelled his first-ever interview on US soil because reporter Christiane Amanpour refused to wear a headscarf. It is difficult to cover the team because their head of security Mohammed Hossein Hamisi is always watching them.  Hamisi is said to have close links with the Islamic Republic of Iran government and sends reports back to them on any suspicious activity surrounding the team.

{"title": "Ten surprise players who could be named in Gareth Southgate\u2019s secret 55-man England squad for Qatar World Cup", "author": "Kealan Hughes", "date": "19 Oct 2022", "content": "Fifa rules stipulate that each country must submit a list of at least 35 players by Friday. The list will be kept secret and can include a maximum of 55 names, from which the final squad will be selected. Southgate and other   managers have to submit their final list of 26 players by November 14, but several more players will likely be selected until that point. There are a few players on the fringes who could be included, such as James Ward-Prowse, Ivan Toney and Jarrod Bowen, all of whom have been called up before. But there are many others whose chances of making the plane are much less likely, and here SunSport takes a look at ten of those players. The   defender, 25, has had a brilliant campaign for the Gunners despite featuring in a less familiar right-back role. He has also proven himself at centre-back and Southgate recognised his ability with a call-up to the Euro 2020 squad, and with the Three Lions suffering an injury crisis at right-back White will surely be included. There has been a recent groundswell of calls for Maddison to go the World Cup, partly because of his form but also because some saw him as the solution to England's recent goal drought. The Leicester star, 25, has five goals and two assists this season and although  , Southgate does not seem to like him. Elliott is quietly impressing at Liverpool and would likely have a good chance of making the squad if competition was not so fierce. The fact he has never been called up means Southgate will likely overlook the 19-year-old and allow him to continue progressing for the Under-21s, having won three caps so far. Southgate included the   star in his squad for the last World Cup in 2018 but his last cap came almost four years ago. However, the 26-year-old's versatility and ability to play at right wing-back means there is a chance he could be selected with   though injury. Once touted as a future England star, Callum Hudson-Odoi has failed to live up to his potential and is now on loan at Bayer Leverkusen from Chelsea. The 21-year-old has failed to score for the German side in nine appearances but his direct approach gives him an outside shot of making the squad. England's injury crisis at right-back means there could be an unlikely call-up for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who is still yet to make his senior debut. But he will need to get back into the   team and return to form if he is to persuade Southgate to take him to Qatar. The   star - who has been capped by England at Under21 level - is playing his way into contention with two goals and two assists in the Premier League. Eze, 24, has recovered well from an Achilles injury which sidelined him for six months and would offer England something different in midfield thanks to his ability to glide past players. Smalling, 32, was dropped from the squad in 2017 because Southgate felt he was not suited to playing out from the back. The England boss preferred John Stones and Harry Maguire but with the latter out of form he could look to Smalling, who  . Burn, 30, is another player who could appeal to Southgate because of his flexibility. He can play in different systems as a centre-back or a left-back and his 6ft6 frame could be a threat for   from set-pieces, which proved so effective at the last World Cup. Sessegnon, 22, is a more attacking left wing-back option and could earn a place in the squad if Kieran Trippier is needed on the other flank. He may be reliant on Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell picking up an injury however as that duo were preferred for the Euros."},

Even if Kalvin Phillips overcomes his latest shoulder issue to make the plane to Qatar, we are certain to see tonight\u2019s midfield pairing start against  . During this breathless match against the Germans, Bellingham and Rice had some nice moments and protected the defence reasonably. And in fairness, both showed maturity beyond their years to keep cool when   were 2-0 down and facing yet another defeat. In the end Rice, 23, and Bellingham, 19 \u2014 along with most others at Wembley \u2014 will have left pretty happy, even though the Three Lions should have won this Nations League match. Like Friday\u2019s 1-0 loss in Italy   was guilty of dropping too deep but, when he did get forward, the teenager made a real difference. He played a part in England\u2019s first goal and was fouled by Nico Schlotterbeck for Harry Kane\u2019s penalty, so this will give him some belief. Yet Southgate would have been helped over these final two games before Qatar had we seen more from players such as Phil Foden, who has yet to really ignite his international career. And we also must hope that Jordan Pickford remains injury-free at the   because if Nick Pope starts in goal, we are in real trouble. At least Rice, with 34 caps, and Bellingham, with 17, appear dependable despite their obvious lack of experience. Ahead of linking up with the national team, Bellingham made his 100th appearance for Dortmund in the 1-0 win over local rivals Schalke. The midfield ace is not exactly short of confidence. Privately, he feels he should already have featured more in Southgate\u2019s side and was frustrated at playing only a bit-part in Euro 2020. At Wembley last night, the Brummie also had a fascinating battle with Ilkay Gundogan \u2014 and the pair could be team-mates next season if Manchester City get their way. , who fancy their chances of landing \u00a3100million-rated whizkid. Bellingham, whose style has been likened to Bryan Robson by Gary Lineker, was aged 17 years, four months and 13 days when making his senior debut against Ireland in November 2020. Still, this was only his eighth start \u2014 so in Qatar, he will have a lot of growing up to do in terms of international football. Against the Germans, Bellingham worked hard and made some crucial blocks while he also hooked the ball away from the boot of Gundogan who had clear sight of goal. Yet the problem was that with Germany having so much of the ball \u2014 they had 65 per cent possession in the first half \u2014 it was difficult for Bellingham to make much of a difference. He had his first chance after Gundogan scored Germany\u2019s opener from the spot but blazed over and then delivered another long-range shot but it was an easy save for Marc-Andre ter Stegen. He then got forward into the box ahead of  . Southgate, often criticised for not changing a game, then saw his subs make a real difference for the leveller with  . Bellingham played a part in another goal forcing a foul from Schlotterbeck to earn a penalty, even though he felt the full force of a nasty challenge, which resulted in a yellow card. Kane showed a cool head to score what we thought was a winning penalty before a terrible error from Pope allowed  . In injury-time, Bellingham made way for Henderson.

But the  star lifted the trophy on Monday night after an incredible season with his club, as well as a return to international football with his country, France. Benzema, who boasts   and a love of Bugatti motors, scored a staggering 15 goals in 12 games in the Champions League last campaign. And he recorded his best ever LaLiga tally - notching 27 strikes in just 32 games.  caps a remarkable journey for Benzema, after he was exiled from the national team and faced trial for his alleged part in blackmailing Mathieu Valbuena over a sex tape. And in stunning American Wag Jordan Ozuna, who used to work at fast food chain Hooters, he has found love off the pitch and is happy to share that with the world. Often overlooked and criticised, Benzema has scored 328 goals for Los Blancos - since signing for around \u00a335million in 2009. Before last season, he was an underrated cog in sides that won three LaLiga titles and four Champions League trophies. However, he played second-fiddle to   - who was bought the same year from  . Unselfishly, Benzema admitted: \"When Cristiano Ronaldo played for Real Madrid, he scored 50 to 60 goals a year. \"So, my moves were to give him an advantage on the field, generate spaces, because I exchanged the ball well in the opponent's area.\u00a0He was much more effective than I was.\" That all changed in 2018-19, when   left for Juventus. Benzema was left as the main man, and how he thrived. Across the previous four seasons, he's scored 131 goals in all competitions. While in this campaign he has five in 10 games. He admitted his priorities changed after CR7 departed for Turin. Benzema explained: \u201cIt\u2019s been different for me since Cristiano Ronaldo left\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s true that I\u2019ve scored many more goals, but when Cristiano was here, we had a different style of play, I was providing more assists. He really helped me on and off the pitch. \u201cBut at that time, I did know that I could do more and when he left, it was the time to change my game, change my ambitions and I am doing that well at the moment.\u201d But it hasn't always been plain-sailing in Benzema's career. Misdemeanours off the pitch threatened his reputation, and perhaps derailed it somewhat. His international career suffered, certainly. Slights of character began in 2010, when French TV channel M6 reported that four members of the\u00a0French national team\u00a0were being investigated for their roles as clients in a prostitute ring operated inside of a Paris nightclub, with some of the women allegedly being underage. Benzema was one of those mentioned, along with Franck Rib\u00e9ry, Sidney Govou, and Hatem Ben Arfa. Benzema and Rib\u00e9ry were acquitted by a judge because of lack of sufficient evidence that the pair knew the prostitutes were underaged. But the young striker's card was marked. In 2015, Benzema was arrested by police for his alleged part in\u00a0blackmailing\u00a0fellow  \u00a0over the alleged recording of a sex-tape on a mobile phone. Noel Le Graet, the president of the FFF, announced a suspension of the striker from the national team.. The case went to trial in 2021, and   of conspiring to blackmail Valbuena with the sex tape. Benzema was handed a one-year suspended sentence and fined \u00a375,000. But, it was the cost of losing six years of his international career that hurt the most. Since 2021, Didier Deschamps has reinstated Benzema back into the Les Bleus line-up. And with 10 goals in his 16 games across the last year, it's the national side that seemingly lost out on his talents. What better way for redemption to lead the French line in Qatar and win the World Cup. Fiercely private off the pitch, practicing Muslim Benzema kept his love life out of the limelight during his epic rise. He was married to Chloe De Launay, who is the mother of their two children Ibrahim and Melia. But their romance was reportedly hit by controversy and alleged infidelity. Benzema is now reportedly dating  . The 32-year-old used to work as a\u00a0 \u00a0waitress in Las Vegas but is now signed to several US-based modelling agencies. And she seems to have encouraged him to open up more about his life. They both follow each other on Insta and have publicly shared heart emojis during exchanges, while she was said to be in Paris back in May to support Benzema crowned king of the Champions League.

But it was a bleak start for the ex-Newcastle striker who was out jumped by Saliba for the visitors\u2019 opening goal after Bukayo Saka\u2019s delicious, curling corner. He was unable to make any crucial touch in the first-half as Saliba did a superb job of snaffling him up. Social media was sent into meltdown of posts with Toney being emptied out of French centre-back Saliba's pockets. Toney did, in fairness, lash a peach of a Matt Le Tissier-esque free-kick, just inches over the bar after the break. Southgate will certainly need to see more of that if he is to lay his marker down for a place at the Qatar World Cup. Many will be championing Toney's England plight given he has done it the hard way after being rejected at Leicester at age 14, saving Northampton from relegation at age 18 before being cast-off by Newcastle. He also played in League One at Barnsley, Shrewsbury, Wigan and Scunthorpe, before finding a home at Peterborough. Now he has made history at Brentford as their first player to be called-up by England since May 1939.

Rob Page jumped on to the moving twirler some while ago but his job as   that all but kicks off with the   in November. For both, those are quite some leaps. The actual difference in what they do is enormous \u2014 although nothing like as much as that in salaries. Page\u2019s \u00a3350,000-a-year or so is dwarfed by   for each   at Stamford Bridge.

His career in the Premier League was even briefer than Page\u2019s, a mere now-you-see-me-now-you-don\u2019t eight matches with Southampton and plenty in the hinterland. And these fast stats stress the simple truth that you don\u2019t have to be an outstanding player or, for that matter much of a player at all (witness  ,   and many more) to be a top manager. \n Indeed, the better the player the harder it becomes. Expectations are greater and I must say I also wonder whether many of those possessing God-given, sublime skills are sympathetic enough with the struggles of journeymen pros. Potter must be among the most unemotional of coaches. By comparison, say,   is a spitfire and Wenger a dervish. Meanwhile, Potter may be boiling or bubbling inside but merely strokes his beard. He and Page are successful representatives of those un-managers (unassertive, unassuming, understated and understanding) upon whom so many clubs depend. For all their low-key backgrounds, though, the football they promote is anything but boring. At Stamford Bridge, for the first time in his career, Potter will be working with superstars while Page, for all that he is an international team boss, has had only limited experience of high-octane performers. These include   and   for whom he has succeeded in providing a relaxed atmosphere away from sometimes stormy club life. Wales\u2019 recent achievements suggest   has not been missed at all.

It will doubtless be regarded as a sign that   is pig-headed, out-of-touch and past his sell-by date as   manager. But Southgate\u2019s loyalty towards Maguire is cast-iron. The England boss has been\u00a0licking his wounds for three months since the   at Molineux capped a miserable winless four-match Nations League run in June. This Thursday, he will name his squad for clashes with Italy, on Friday week, and Germany, the following Monday, which represent England\u2019s final matches before the weird, disorientating and utterly corrupt mid-season  . And   troubled captain seems certain to be included \u2014 despite his axing by club boss  . When   has started this season, United\u2019s record reads played three, lost three.  When he has been excluded, Ten Hag\u2019s men have played four, won four. Yet for Southgate, old Slabhead remains untouchable.\u00ad That defeat by Hungary was England\u2019s\u00a0biggest home defeat in 94 years and easily the worst night of Southgate\u2019s six-year reign. And one of the loudest groans came when he introduced Maguire as a late sub, after John Stones had been sent off and Hungary had scored their third goal. Maguire, once a man-of-the-people cult hero among England fans, is now treated with extraordinary levels of contempt. He was   before the friendly against Ivory Coast in March and even as far away as Melbourne,  . So why is Maguire afforded apparently special treatment by Southgate, who has previously claimed he would only choose those playing regularly for their clubs? Well, it\u2019s not as if there are a whole host of in-form English\u00a0central defenders. Eric Dier, who has been consistently excellent in Spurs\u2019 back three, will receive a long overdue recall.  Maguire, once a man-of-the-people cult hero among England fans, is now treated with extraordinary levels of contempt. Especially as Southgate may revert to a back three for Qatar. And Stones, suspended for next week\u2019s trip to Milan, is being included more frequently in\u00a0Manchester City\u2019s starting line-up. But beyond those two, Ben White is playing for   at right-back \u2014 the one position in which Southgate is already famously well-stocked. And the other two centre-backs in the Euros squad last year were Tyrone Mings and Conor Coady. Mings has been stripped of the Aston Villa captaincy, while Wolves\u2019 Coady has been loaned to Everton. Marc Guehi of Crystal Palace and AC Milan\u2019s Italian title-winner Fikayo Tomori are both in the mix but neither were particularly impressive for England in June, when Southgate rightly claimed Maguire had been his best centre-half. Apart from this scarcity of potential replacements, Southgate has always remained remarkably loyal to those who started regularly during the 2018 World Cup.  Seven of his Russian starting XI lined up against Germany in Munich in June and Jordan Henderson might have been an eighth, if available. Maguire was also included in Uefa\u2019s Team of the Tournament for last summer\u2019s Euros \u2014 despite missing the opening two matches through injury. Many of us had questioned Southgate\u2019s decision to name an unfit player \u2014 a failing of previous overly loyal England managers \u2014 but Maguire proved his boss spectacularly right. It isn\u2019t true that Maguire has never let England down \u2014 his early sending-off in a Nations League home defeat by Denmark came just weeks after he was arrested on holiday in Greece, causing him to be axed from Southgate\u2019s squad. But by and large, Maguire has been excellent for his country. And however badly England ended last season, Southgate is easily his nation\u2019s most successful manager since Sir Alf Ramsey. He has fully earned the right to do things his way in Qatar. And that will mean a prominent role for Maguire, despite the booing mob. Southgate is a long-term manager with a long memory, in an age of knee-jerk short-termism. If he fails in Qatar, he will fail on his own terms \u2014 with Maguire in his team. So they\u2019ll be hoping you haven\u2019t seen the injury-time chaos in Sunday\u2019s Serie A clash between Juventus and Salernitana. A 96th-minute \u2018winner\u2019 by Juve\u2019s Arkadiusz Milik was incorrectly ruled out for offside by VAR, when a defender lurking by the corner flag, clearly playing everyone on, was somehow not spotted by the remote official. In the ensuing furore, Juve boss Max Allegri and three players were sent off. So, yeah, the system is fine, it\u2019s just our incompetent muppets to blame \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to see elsewhere. After one victory in 17 matches under the old regime, England have won six out of seven this summer \u2014 many in thrilling, record-breaking style. It was ludicrous that moderately bad light stopped play on Sunday, with England 33 runs short of victory against South Africa. Yet several thousand still turned out on a\u00a0Monday morning to watch 25 minutes of cricket \u2014 testament to the public appreciation of this team and Test cricket itself. Perhaps the ECB can now stop obsessing about The Hundred and start prioritising the sport\u2019s original, and best, format. Yet English teams have lifted only one of the last seven major trophies and, in last week\u2019s openers, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United all lost. Spanish clubs won nine trophies out of ten between 2014-18, without enjoying overall financial dominance. It would be unspeakably dull if Premier League sides lived up to their financial might \u2014 but they are falling way, way short. So, while Gareth Southgate will still name his England squad on Thursday for the Nations League games against Italy and Germany, he will not hold his usual media interviews. Some of the decisions over what is or isn\u2019t 'disrespectful' during the period of national mourning for the Queen have been farcical \u2014 such as the closing of a bicycle rack in Norwich. But the FA\u2019s paranoia is extreme. NEXT week marks the first anniversary of Jimmy Greaves\u2019 death. And if you\u2019d like to read about English football\u2019s greatest scorer\u2019s life by those who knew him best, then I\u2019d heartily recommend The Jimmy Greaves We Knew, collated by Mike Donovan."},

The decision was taken due to the severe limitation on police resources and organisational issues surrounding the many thousands of people heading to London to mourn the Queen. With 3,000 PSV fans due to travel from Holland for a match which was classed as Category One by the police, it was clear that there would not be sufficient officers in attendance at the Emirates.  trip to the Brentford Community Stadium was given the green light because it is a Category Three match in security terms. The Gunners are struggling to find a slot to reschedule the   match, which must be played before the final Europa League group games on November 3. The next two weeks are out of the question because of an international break. And the only week after that which does not already have European commitments has a full midweek of Premier League fixtures. The most likely scenario is that Arsenal will seek to postpone their top of the table Premier League game against   scheduled for October 19 and play PSV the following evening. But that would still require the agreement of both the Premier League and City. Prem chiefs are already struggling to find a space in a tight fixture list to reschedule all the games which were called off last weekend. With absolutely no breathing space before football shuts down for six weeks for the World Cup in Qatar, the earliest potential opportunity for another round of games would be some time in January. Yet despite Thursday\u2019s Europa League game being called off, Chelsea\u2019s home Champions League game against RB Salzburg tomorrow will go ahead because it is not a Category One match. But Sunday\u2019s   against Liverpool match was axed as it's less than 24 hours before the state funeral and Manchester United against Leeds is also postponed."},

The source said: \u201cHe is hopeful he will feature in United\u2019s Europa League game this week against Real Sociedad. \u201cThe coaches have been talking to him and have been looking at working on things that he can improve - body shape and positioning and speed in the first defensive moments. \u201cHarry has rolled his sleeves up and is getting stuck in.

In May, the England boss said: \"For me, he\u2019s still their best centre-back. For us, with all our data across the season, he\u2019s been the same.

{"title": "Man Utd\u2019s Lisandro Martinez ready to star for Argentina in Qatar at the World Cup, after adapting to Premier League life", "author": "Tim Vickery", "date": "5 Sep 2022", "content": "There are few changes in Argentina\u2019s squad to meet Honduras and Jamaica in this month\u2019s FIFA dates, the last chance to warm up before the World Cup kicks off in November. This is hardly a shock. There is no need for radical alteration. This is a team that has been unbeaten for more than three years, and that last time out   at Wembley in June before cruising 5-0 past Estonia. But there is a little tinker round the edges, and it has to do with the Premier League. If there is one position in Qatar that might be up for grabs, it is that of the left sided centre back.   is undisputed first choice on the right, and has made the position his own over the past 16 months. Alongside him is Nico Otamendi, the former   defender who, at the age of 34 has probably seen better days. Now at Benfica, Otamendi could come under pressure for his place - and even if he stays in the team, he is likely to pick up a suspension and need to be replaced in the course of the World Cup. With his form in the Dutch league, Marcos Senesi had played himself into contention. He made his Argentina debut in June, coming off the bench for the last half hour against Estonia. He must surely have hoped that   would boost his chances. Bournemouth may not have been the wrong place. But it was certainly the wrong time. Without a pre-season, with no time to get to know his new colleagues\u00a0 - and defending is always a collective task - Senesi was thrown straight into the deep end against in form Arsenal. And after one heavy defeat, came the trip to a Liverpool side smarting from their own loss to  . Not surprisingly, Liverpool came at Bournemouth like a wounded beat, and after a 9-0 scoreline Senesni could look back on a bruising, traumatic start to life in the Premier League. And to make matters worse, he has now lost his place in the Argentina squad. Meanwhile, Lisandro Martinez is in there - of course, because he has been Otamendi\u2019s back up for a while, and started two World Cup qualifiers earlier this year. Like Senesi, Martinez came in to the Premier League from Holland, and also got off to a sticky start, with deeply disappointing defeats to Brighton and Brentford.  But he has two big advantages over Senesi. He arrived earlier, with time to bed in - and with a coach who knows him well. And also, he is playing for a far better team. Manchester United have dug deep under  , and ground out a sequence of morale boosting results. In the crunch game against Liverpool, fortune smiled on Lisandro Martinez. The suspension of Darwin Nunez took away a physical striker who would have looked to engage the centre back in a battle. And David De Gea saved him from scoring an own goal - which would hardly have been his fault, but which would have led to some negative headlines and added to the pressure. So far, his lack of height has not been a huge problem. Martinez has defended efficiently, and as his confidence grows he is starting to show more of that left footed ability to play the ball out of defence - almost certainly the main reason that Ten Hag spent so much to acquire him. Doing all this for Manchester United gives Lisandro Martinez a profile bigger than anything he has previously enjoyed. It could help him overtake Otamendi on the final straight of the road to Qatar."},

Ahead of     squad announcement, Nike unveiled the new England home and away kits online, with the FA in the dark as to this happening up until the moment they went online.  The new home kit pays homage to the 1996 jersey, combining The Three Lions traditional white with a sky blue and navy shoulder pattern.  These colours are also repeated on the shorts and socks of the full kit, though fans were far from pleased with them.  One fan wrote on Twitter: \"If that\u2019s England\u2019s new home kit... Nike football need 2 hold there heads in shame!! It\u2019s woeful.\" A second user added: \"New England home kit looking like a sports direct special.\" Another user commented: \"Shocking, never been a fan of England using blue - our kit should only be using red & white (our flag).\" The announcement post revealed 13 new kits from the various nations Nike manufacture kits for, including   holders France, Netherlands, and Portugal.  However, these kits were also met with dismay, with one user lambstaing the designs and commenting: \"I think every national team deserves an apology.\" Despite the fierce criticism the other kits - particularly England's home kit - received, the all red away kit has earned praise.  \n One user said: \"How can you create an awful home shirt and yet one of the most beautiful away ones at the same time?  \"This red 1990s inspired kit is a belter of a shirt for England in the next World Cup in Qatar.\" While another, clearly with their hopes up, added: \"When Kane lifts the trophy it better be in the red kit not that other monstrosity.\" Earlier today,   before the World Cup finals in November.  There were surprise inclusions for two   stars, while a number of other players may feel aggrieved to not make the squad despite their good form for their respective clubs. Ivan Toney was also given his first international call-up and will be hoping to impress the England boss under closer inspection."}
